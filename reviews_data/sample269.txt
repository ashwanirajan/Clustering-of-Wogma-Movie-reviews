Samrat & Co is an unfortunate recreation of Sherlock Holmes in an Indian setting, one that miserably fails in its mission. The only saving grace is that a large chunk of the audience will probably think they're really smart, because they'll solve the film's puzzles quicker than the Indian Sherlock they're watching.For starters, let's set aside the fact that Kaushik Ghatak's Samrat & Co is a recreation of a Sherlock Holmes-esque character, in India - an absolute travesty of a recreation at that. No, first let's talk about the film as an independent cinematic work, a murder mystery thrust into the hands of a super detective.Mumbai-based celebrity detective, the eponymous Samrat, receives a strange case from a pretty young lady, a case that prompts him to travel with her to Shimla. Ultimately, a series of murders unfold, as Samrat races against time to connect the clues strewn across his path and solve the case.Unfortunately, what we're served through this plot (that's anyway older than the hills the film is set in,) is a succession of rather juvenile 'mysterious' circumstances and events which shouldn't challenge a schoolboy, much less a supposed ace detective who can accurately guess a person's life history within minutes of meeting them.  Predictably laden with red herrings galore, the film tries too hard to be clever, but falls flat because the writers either underestimated the audience, or over-estimated themselves. Big work is made of silly substitution cipher codes and clues as simple as A-B-C.The tangled mess of a screenplay was bad enough, but what makes matters worse is that most of the film is shot against a chroma background, with computer-generated scenery added later. It gives the film an fake look throughout; a pity because setting the film in the hills gave the film a chance to be a visual treat, a chance that was squandered by the filmmakers. Now let's get to the film's real crime - the attempted murder of Messrs Holmes and Watson. A mockery is made of these iconic literary characters, as their Indian counterparts Samrat and Chakradhar resort to showboating, buffoonery and general incompetence, while relegating common sense and propriety to some forgotten corner. Rajeev Khandelwal, a fair performer otherwise, really overdoes the Sherlock, while the less said about the guy who plays Watson, the better. The supporting cast of the film is essentially an assortment of people over-acting and under-acting.In an attempt to draw at least something positive from the film, one can say that it least it never drops its pace and might even keep you interested in its silliness at all times - you wonder how much harder will the makers of the film try. Hopefully, Samrat & Co will die a death with the film, and future filmmakers will think long and hard before creating such lightweight caricatures of characters who have enthralled so many generations.

The whole team deserves praise for introducing us to a new private investigator, I dont think hindi films has any detective film in past many years... atleast I have not seen it.....

        ...To his credit, Khandelwal tries to do full justice to his character but he is hampered by a shoddy screenplay. A whodunit should keep us hooked to our seats and should keep us guessing. Here, the proceedings get tedious and after a while you stop caring for victims. You want it all to end quickly, so as to rush home and read The Hound Of The Baskervilles all over again. The ending leaves scope for a sequel and for Holmes’s sake the filmmakers shouldn’t botch it up the next time...

This amateur attempt at the genre leaves a bitter taste in your mouth, and you may not be as welcoming of the next one that comes along. Hopefully, Ghatak will do justice to his characters in a sequel...

        ...Well the movie has a gripping screenplay along with decent performance by few actors like Rajeev and Madalsa. However, besides that the movie is a weak attempt in a detective based suspense thriller type of films. The cases were artificially tough which in fact turned out to be so simple that any kid could solve it easily as they have been watching TV serials like 'CID' and 'Gumraah'. 'Samrat & Co.' is definitely a better product than these TV series and thus would recommend it for 'C.I.D' & Co. fans only. As for all the 'Rajshri' banner fans, looks like their last hopes lies only in the next Salman Khan starrer film under this banner, till then keep watching their earlier classics....

So simply skip it and watch the American TV Series “True Detective” instead, if you really wish to see something spectacular about detectives....

But all the expectations are let down by director Kaushik Ghatak. Trust me Samrat is no Sherlock Holmes, Feluda, Byomkesh Bakshi or Hercule Poirot. If you love to see Bollywood mystery films and have nothing else to watch this weekend, better get yourself a DVD of Bhool Bhulaiyaa and rewatch rather than going for this squanderous stinker....

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.As a Sherlockian, Pradeep, I will probably give this a try anyway - and it's not as if Holmes has been done badly over here, too! (Throws a dart at a  picture of Benedict Cumberbatch.)I'd wondered if India had ever done a desi equivalent of Holmes and Watson - are there any better movies along these lines I should check out?@TimELiebe: Sherlock is my favourite fictional character of all time. I've read the complete collection over and over and over again. I don't mind adaptations, but this one was quite a travesty!Off the top of my head there aren't very many good Holmes adaptations here. Can't think of any mediocre ones either. But have you ever watched an old TV series called Byomkesh Bakshi? Not quite Holmes, but definitely India's most famous on screen detective!@Pradeep - no, I've never heard of BYOMKESH BAKSHI before just now. I'll see if I can't find DVDs of it over here w/English subs - thanks! :)@TimELiebe - Feluda movies might be of interest to you. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feluda_in_filmThanks, @Swapnil! :)Sorry I didn't get back to you sooner, but I never get the e-mails that my comments have been replied to....Direction: 2.5    Story: 2.5    Lead Actors: 2.5    Character Artists: 2    Dialogues: 2    Screenplay: 2.5    Music Director: 0    Lyrics: 0Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
