Wow! Is the film fraternity celebrating woman's month or something? While Ladies Vs Ricky Bahl is no where close to bringing all things feminine to screen as The Dirty Picture was, Ladies Vs Ricky Bahl does attempt at portraying various shades of women without stereotyping or caricaturing them. Yet, though the film is interesting it is not entertaining enough.Déjà vu is not a good feeling to have when you are watching a film's trailer. And Ladies Vs. Ricky Bahl evokes a strong "been there, seen that" emotion. Not only have we seen Anushka Sharma and Ranveer Singh who form the lead pair, together not too long ago in Band Baaja Baaraat, they also seem to be playing similar characters too - street-smart and upbeat about life. And both the films are directed by Maneesh Sharma.
Ladies Vs. Ricky Bahl carries this other strong flavor of Bonnie and Clyde or our own desi version - Shaad Ali's Bunty Aur Babli.
And yet, the lead pair, especially Anushka Sharma has an air of freshness around her whenever she comes on screen. Though the exuberance seems a bit forced and trying-too-hard in these two dance sequences. But nevertheless, there is some hope of a few nice moments and decent performances given the team's track record. If nothing else, the hope at least takes away some of the negative vibes that the overall impression that the look and feel of the trailers has created about the film. The music too seems way too generic.

  "Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned." But a woman is a woman after all. These are the two lines you are most likely to read in every other review of Ladies Vs Ricky Bahl. A woman is warm and compassionate but you wrong her, and she is capable of making your life hell. But, she will turn back to her warm and compassionate self at the slightest chance. While this is an over-generalization of course and Ladies Vs Ricky Bahl is guilty as charged, I was slightly charmed by the three women representing the three facets of a today's woman - strength in a man's world; old-school simplicity; superficial & so? - and there is a fourth woman who combines the three. Ladies Vs Ricky Bahl started making its way into my good books because the writer spent time in thinking about his women.

But, there is no spark. 
And no, spark doesn't mean adding absolutely irrelevant songs that bump you out of the stories. The strategy might have worked for Yash Raj Films earlier. But then the music was worth listening to and the choreography and colors were worth being shaken in and out of your film.
It's a shame that throughout the first half, I was wondering if a few better known faces for the three women - Dimple, Raina and Saira - would have engaged better. I was thinking about non-top actresses who could've added spunk to the three women's decent performances. They all acted well, but there was something very plain about how their stories came across. It kept bothering me that the stories were interesting, the actors were apt and yet they weren't able to engage me. 
The mostly basic dialogue is to blame. Except for the lines given to Parineeti Chopra, which were funny and completely in-character, the others were pretty much functional. Parineeti Chopra adds value to it by her comic timing. Also, extra credit to Aditi Sharma and Dipannita Sharma for having done well with the dialogue that they had. There is a lot going on in body language and emotive eyes to convey what was not written. 
And yet, I can't shake off the feeling that maybe supporting actors from say Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na  or Wake Up! Sid would have added the spirit that is missing. 
Interestingly, both Ranveer Singh and Anoushka Sharma do nothing new, except maybe show their calendar-photo bodies off. I guess, no one will complain, because nothing major was really being expected from them. Of course, they are two major characters in the film and all that, but you don't come out with a feeling of them being special for the film. In fact, if I hear the twosome utter the word " partner" once more, I might mark that against the film, for lack of originality. 
However, there are a few "different" thoughts in the film. I don't use the word "original" because I'm sure someone somewhere has done it before. But, there are these sly comments on commercialism and hypocrisy that are brought about in a very casually - a comment about how we don't our Rs.30 wine from our Rs.30,000 wine but are willing to gulp it down, if its packaged in a 5-star environment.  
Unfortunately, along with this is the usual problem that goes with any "con" film. Everything works out too easily and the climax is usually a cop-out. Add to that predictability, having to ask whether you were just conned into thinking this was a woman's film?

          Ladies Vs Ricky Bahl is a decent movie outing.Nothing too heavy or over the top.Dont chase a masterpiece,it's a breezy watch worth your buck
        
ragz_lovespll:
          OK..Ladies vs Ricky Bahl is strictly and sadly a one-time watch

ps3llr:
          An okay and average entertainer, especially for youth but stands nowhere as compared to Band Baaja Baaraat! http://fb.me/YkcPWjwD

          LADIES V/S RICKY BEHL !!! A TIME PASS MOVIE, BUT NO COMPARISION TO THE DIRTY PICTURE
        
nilu197:
          Ladies vs Ricky Bahl is a timepass film,lacks spunk & freshness of Band Baja Barat,acting is fine,story predictable but  not boring:)

          Ladies vs Ricky bahl.....average movie wasnt boring atall....gr8 direction....ranveer very energetic...one time watch
        
filmigirl:
          Ladies Vs Ricky Bahl was okay. 1st half = really good fun. 2nd half = not so much. Ranveer brought his A game & the three ladies were <3...
        
FaizanPatel:
          I would rate 3 out of 5 for Ladies Vs Ricky Bahl.

corpwarrior66:
          # Ladies vs Ricky Bahl is a one time c movie; #Anushka has stripped to the barest possible but lacks the oomph factor; overall 2.5 out of 5.

BlessChet:
          Watched Ladies vs Ricky Bahl yest. Not as much fun as Band Baajaa Baarat but tolerable. The spark b/w Ranveer & Anushka was missing
        
bhavis:
          Ladies Vs Ricky Bahl brings few things feminine to screen, interesting but not entertaining enough.
        
ankita_leo:
          ladies vs ricky bahl,

_Gablu:
          Same team of "Band Baaja Baaraat",but "Ladies vs Ricky Bahl" could not satisfy.Truely,it has nothing.Only liked the girl "Dimple" in d movie
        
_chirag:
          Ladies vs Ricky Bahl - typical Indian movie ending, when will this Bollywood industry grow up #WastedSunday
        
wannabeSW:
          Jeet ke harne wale ko Ladies vs Ricky Behl ka writer kehte hain. Such a predictable YRF ending.
        
VivekRathod_:
          "Ladies vs Ricky Bahl" terrible movie..
        
TheDoctor_gk:
          Ladies vs Ricky Bahl. Terrible. None of the actors can actually do their job. Copy of John Tucker Must Die.
        
SulemaniKeeda:
          Ladies vs Ricky Behl - 1/5.  A "kaun" movie.  Bakwas se thoda hi better hai.
        
siddhuS94sid:
          Parineeti Chopra is the only pull of Ladies Vs Ricky Bahl. The film drags on.
        
shishirshirke:
          It was sucha waste to time and money to watch Ricky Behl VS Ladies.... Anushka Sharma was complere waste in the movie...
        
shilpiiz:
          Ladies vs Ricky bahl is such a stupid movie. :/ If you liked it..you're a dumbo! Why isn't anyone making movies like Rang de basanti, Black?

          Saw Ladies vs Ricky Bahl. Nothing great other than Parineeti. Also Ranveer, Anushka should stick to NOT exposing. #movies

LizaSaha:
          Watched Ladies vs Ricky Bahl. Predictable, lacked the punch and the fun factor.The only character that stood out was that of the Delhi girl.

          Ladies VS Ricky Bahl, is just "Band Baaja Baraat" gone wrong.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Three women set out to con a conman.Three women set out to con a conman.
Dimple's love crazy attitude. Even when she is conned!
Ha ha ha! A hot looking IIT non-male (that's what they call women in IIT. Fact.), I'm sure many IIT males would find that a very interesting concept.
Usually when people who shouldn't be seen by the target, follow the target, I think it's stupid. But here, it kind of worked, because that is what a hurt, woman, non-professional con would do. 

The pop-culture references like LOL or iPhone. It felt they were trying too hard to fit in with the young crowd.
The choreography of the misplaced songs is way to video album-ish.
Dippinnita Sharma's makeup. It showed that she had layers of make-up on. And it was patchy too.
How do all these property papers get made without a photo ID?
entertaining movie .. obviously better then previous movies released like Ra.One and othersAnushka Sharma has cut down a lot of weight but still lukin gud in dis movie (tried to expose as well)Of course, Anand, our choices don't always have to match. I try to write my review in such a way that it is clear to the reader what I liked and didn't. Then, they can accordingly make their decision based on their choices.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
