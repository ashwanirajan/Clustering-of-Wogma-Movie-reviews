Asks pertinent questions subtly, but everything about it seems like it is for “effect”. None of it germane to a story. The very premise of Begum Jaan is too dramatic for my taste - a new international border running through the middle of a house. Then the dialogue seems over-written with the intention to shock. After all, what is a brothel setting without women who speak their mind? But at least in the trailer it comes across as a certain setting chosen so that such dialogue can be written rather than dialogue written for a particular situation. What surprised me is, in these 2-minutes, Chunkey Pandey's acting felt more powerful than Vidya Balan's. In its way it is both a good sign and bad. A strong villain who can intimidate always makes things interesting. The other actresses reminded me a lot of Gulaab Gang. This one really looks like it could go either way. So, in that sense looking forward to it. Unfortunately, I will not be able to watch this one on the day of release. I will hopefully catch it on the following Monday. Keep an eye out here and on our social media pages: Facebook - Twitter

  Are women treated any differently now than they were back in 1947? Are women “sex providers”  whether or not they are sex-workers? Is national pride or religion more important than humanity? Was the land of the people not raped when the border was laid out in 1947? These are the questions Begum Jaan, the film asks without saying it out loud. While that is worth appreciating, the metaphors are so direct that they just about qualify as metaphors. Begum Jaan then is full of ideas that get badly beaten up in execution.Begum Jaan is loud – both the film and the character. It is ok for one character in a film to be loud, but when a whole cackle of characters is loud it is difficult to take it seriously. It reminds you of loud Hindi TV series or typical Hindi slapstick films – an association that is unlikely to bode well for any film. To top that off, almost each woman in Begum Jaan's brothel is pretty much the same. There are barely any distinguishing characteristics - except for their accent. There is a touch of a difference in terms of one has a lover, one has a child and so on. But these are superficial differences. Something the writers seem to have added to convince themselves that these women are different from each other.Same thing can be said about the actors. They are all models who have been asked to accessorise their costumes a little differently from each other but else the body language, the mannerisms, the thought process, are all more or less, identical. Vidya Balan of course stands out. The powerful actress that she is, she blends in too. After the initial exposition, she becomes more and more Begum Jaan and less Vidya Balan. Other than her though, it is only Chunkey Pandey who moves you – his first scene in the film is enough to send a chill down the spine. That the film doesn't capitalise on his acting any further is only a shame. That there is no depth in the writing keeps coming back to you in different shapes and forms - be it in the situation, the involvement with characters or even the dialogue. It doesn't help that until the interval, everything you see you know from the trailer. And yet, there are a couple of things that you would expect to happen and they don't. That in its own way is refreshing. However, some of the unpredictable things are also made so for effect and seem out of place. Moreover, the drama - extended length of scene, over-written dialogue, loud background score,  husky voices (because you know, they are sex-workers) - makes some parts of the film almost unbearable. That is pretty much symbolic of almost everything about the film. Whether it is one of the two impactful moments in the film or the overall concept itself – it all seems just skin deep.

: its a one time watch movie.. story is not soo good except Vidhya Acting

            Nay! Thumbs Down,
            by Fan
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Well this movie failed to impress the audience.Horrible film.Everything about it is loud.  Characters are loud, music is loud, dialogues are loud, treatment is loud.  Every girl playing the prostitute thinks that she is either Jay or Veeru playing a role in Sholay.  The situations are nonsensical.  Dialogues are written by someone who seems to have had something illegal to smoke.  This is a movie which might have worked in the 1980s but certainly not in 2017.  Too dramatic, every one barring Vidhya Balan is trying to overact and over achieve in that department compared to everyone else.  A stupid film about a brothel in the middle of nowhere where an international border is to be drawn.  Why the drama and emotions?  Just shift the kotha by few metres and all is well.  Anyways the kotha is in the middle of nowhere, who the heck will care if it is moved few metres to the east or west.Absolutely a pointless film.Only saving grace is Vidhya Balan, and surprise of surprise Chunky Pandey.  But still the two together are not reasons enough to suffer this cacophony.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
