How far can your love for money and/or love for love take you? What? Did I hear 'whatever'? Pretty much.Bored housewife. Extra-marital affair. Blackmail. And then a match between the wife and the blackmailer. A match of whose a worse person. Like they say, the match could go either way. It could be a really interesting game of wits and whose worse between bad and evil. Or it could just go the Race way. Also, the cast isn't very inspiring. Both Neil Nitin Mukesh and Ameesha Patel have hardly done anything worth watching that they've pulled off on their own, in a long while now. That still doesn't mean they can't do well, or the film won't be decent. Just that the entire package brings out a very 'average' anticipation.  The music too doesn't seem to have caught up too well either. Music Reviews:
Bollyspice - "3/5"
Bollywood Hungama - "2.5/5"
Milliblog - "steadfastly holds on to his unbearable form"

  Shortcut Romeo is desperate to be stylish, desperate to have a story, desperate to fill in all the elements considered to constitute a Hindi thriller - love, drama, action, betrayal. Only thing missing seems to comedy, thank goodness for some mercies. Yet, you have to give them some leeway for trying, even if they tried way too hard. You have a blackmailer (Neil Nitin Mukesh) taking advantage of having caught a rich woman (Ameesha Patel) red-handed. But this lady ain't going to take it lying down and gives him a good fight at being nasty. Interestingly, both supposedly have shades of good in them too. The schemes and counter-schemes they design are too elaborate and lie too obviously at the mercy of coincidences, which actually happen. Not to mention, they are a tad predictable too. The characters are either nasty or uninteresting for you to invest in them. That leaves the dialogue in the writing department to pull you in. Shortcut Romeo doesn't manage to take you in with any good lines either.The performances too are as dull as one would expect from Ameesha Patel or Neil Nitin Mukesh. However, the latter does try hard to infuse life into his lines and to bring out the mean streak in his character. Puja Gupta too tries her best to be sensuous and simple, but that ultimately amounts to a one-expression deal. The rest of the supporting cast is outright bad with their dialogue delivery and body language. Even so, it does feel like the makers give Shortcut Romeo its best shot. It doesn't feel like they take the audience for granted. Its just that the ability of the writer/director to engage us is limited.
