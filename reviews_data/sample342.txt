A shallow, even if truthful for some couples, take on marriage. Past the one-liners in the trailer, Shaadi Ke Side Effects is more-or-less stuck in a rut.One of the side effect of being married is that you have a baby and that, pretty much, takes over life. This seems to be the focus of Shaadi Ke Side Effects. It is a novel theme. The actors engage us with whatever they do. Yet, I am not sure, how interesting they can keep the going-ons with bickering over a baby's upbringing. Even if it is fun-filled.The part of the audience that will relate to the characters, viz parents, might find it too close to everyday life and thus boring. The other part of the audience might not relate and hence find boring. However, there is a good chance that it'll start out being fun, especially, given the actors. I'd have never imagined Farhan Akhtar and Vidya Balan to be paired opposite each other. That itself is brave. A gutsy move by the actors and the director. Though Vidya Balan is now expected to make out-of-the-box choices, this is really an unlikely move by Farhan Akhtar, especially after Bhaag Milkha Bhaag.Sure, there is a hint of over-acting that comes with the exaggeration you see in the trailer and yet it will ring a bell with anyone who has taken care of a baby.The music is interesting. Now, let's just hope that there is enough in there to hold our interest through the length of the film. Music Reviews:
Bollyspice - "2/5" 
koimoi - "3/5"  
Milliblog - "The side effects of this soundtrack are more-than-adequately welcome!" in a 200-worder!
Music Aloud - "8/10"

  Why do you lie to your partner? To avoid confrontation, to protect them from getting hurt, to protect yourself from hurting, and maybe because you did something to get rid of boredom that they wouldn't approve of. You could blame them, you could blame yourself, but the point is that you end up lying, when you are expected to be honest. This is true of both, men and women. Shaadi Ke Side Effects expresses a very skewed view of this aspect of married life, in a far too stretched-out and repetitive fashion. I understand there are women out there who are like Trisha Roy (Vidya Balan) - obsessed by their child, want nothing to do with their career, friends, husband. And yes, as shocking as it sounds there are men out there like (tackily named) Siddharth Roy (Farhan Akhtar) who think of their child as the third person. But, I guess obsession by a partner begets apathy towards that obsession by the other partner - the obsession could be sports for one couple, socialization for another, food for the third and so on. But, none of this made interesting copy in Shaadi Ke Side Effects.The stereotyping of women is infuriating. But then hey, there are only so many Hindi films in which it is not. In cases like these, I convince myself the makers are not generalizing, they are narrating the story of one man and one woman and their relationship. And then, you see her sister who is similar. And you smile, cool down and say, "okay, it runs in the genes." But, Shaadi Ke Side Effects doesn't stop at that. There are sweeping statements about parents of little children. Even under the satire garb, the exaggeration is gag-worthy. And despite all of this, I saw myself taking sides - for the record, more the man's in this case than the woman's. At one point, when things went the exact opposite of what Siddharth wanted, many in the audience, including me, blurted a "oh no!". Towards the end, I almost furled an abuse at Trisha out loud. This is commendable, considering that other than the fact I know such characters exist, I didn't identify with them at all. 100% credit to Vidya Balan and Farhan Akhtar for that. Ram Kapoor and Vir Das do add their bit of normal and quirk to the mix, but it is all about the lead couple. But for them, Shaadi Ke Side Effects is one of those films that attempt to find a solution for a serious problem, but don't want to lose out on audience by taking the subject seriously. Given my overall angst towards the film and its take, I appreciate that they do try to say something that is universally acceptable - to each his own. The problem though is that they try to inject it with humor using an exaggerated dose of hyperbole - only to end up flat on its face. Worse yet, you have seen almost all the quippy one-liners in the trailers. Other than a couple of witticisms in the first 15-20 minutes, there is hardly any new material that makes you laugh later in the film. This is one film that shouldn't have been longer than a 100 minutes. Each of the 50 minutes after that 100-minute mark is as boring as the Roys' marriage. That is one-third of the film. Not done at all. The music is decent, but when it adds minutes that elongates the experience, that too becomes annoying. Relationships bud, they blossom, they peak, they plateau, you struggle to make changes to them and then wait to see if they bud again or die. Except that with Shaadi Ke Side Effects is about the struggle. It is cute that the couple is grappling with the relationship and wants to find a way out rather than cop out. You might want them to sort it out. But the problem is that you don't necessarily want to witness it.

: Time pass movie with gud acting
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Farhan Akhtar and Vidya balan are too such actors who never disappoint audience.....So we are safe from their side that they two will give their best to the movie.....Rest depends on the script , screenplay and direction....coz trailers were close to hilariouse....I would like it more if Vir das and Ram kapoor ,, both will get enough screen time to show their performance...@Anup *fingers crossed*Farhan Akhtar and Vidya balan such gud actors. nice songssad movie !!! i think after a level it is stretched. waste of money and time@Prafful yeah... :(...totally disagree... With the review...come on ...just because they use humour to deal a serious subject or just because you thought that the story was skewed !!!...though I expected this after pyar ka punchnama.... am also a girl and I liked both movies ...just because director chose to show one side of the story ...you can't blame the movie...by this logic the opposite sex will pan gulag gang before its release....come on ...we can use a few jokes on ourselves...Actually m totally agreed with DIVYA ,,,, although second half fails in competing with the hilarious first half,,,,its an easy watch on Big Screen.....Some tight editing could have made the movie better....@Divya That is the thing I didn't find it funny at all. No more than the SMS husband-wife jokes. I am all for laughing at myself, but need better gags than that. After the ones already exposed in the trailers there is very little new. The way it is done, rather than being a story about one couple, it felt like a general comment which becomes stereotyping, which I have low tolerance for. Hopefully, Gulaab Gang will stick to being a story about the work done by those particular women. @Anup Yeah, it stretched a bit too.I watched it on Saturday though i do feel it was stretched after interval moreover i think every thing was shown in promos and trailer so there was nothing left,but the audience where i watched did enjoyed and i think it is not that bad but a time pass movie though they could have made it more powerful....hmmm...i agree some jokes were actually SMS jokes ...but for example...the initial sequence ...when I make.istake I say sorry....the way it was shown using same example ...it felt different ...and good...not ROFL hilarious...but yes I guess I would have smiled....or when in reponse to farhaan complain that he dreamt about his kid s face similar to that of his mil, his friend suggest to slap the kid daily with a straight face ...cliche...but cute...and the movie ...especially first half is full of such moments...in fact I even liked the story part of second half... regarding songs being too long ...i loved when in first song they use pause to such a great effect ... But its because I don't mind long movies...hostel jakar phir se padhna hi to hai...Could you please fix the 'critics reviews' page here, please? Reviews by Sonia Chopra and Anuj Kumar have been mistakenly pasted in their entirety, it seems..@Divya ha ha ha. That's the thing about films, right? So much depends on where you are coming from. I don't mind long movies at all, it is the disengaged part that what puts me off.@Harsh Fixed. Thank you so much for pointing out.nice movie but not excellent.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
