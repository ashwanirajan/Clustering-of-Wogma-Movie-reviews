
wogma rating: Switch channels if it's on cable (?) - Stating the obvious: No rating applies to a Salman Khan film for Salman Khan fans. 
    
  Dabangg 2 increases the dose of wannabe Rajnikanth, only this time around the serving feels lukewarm. But that means nothing to the Saman-fan now, does it? So eye-rollers like me, can continue with the eye-workout. The fans - well, like they need a go ahead from anyone. Badass Robin Hood is back. But, then was there ever a Goodass Robin Hood? Oh, look at me going about searching for logic and cohesion in a masala film, again! But, hey guess what? Here's something I didn't expect from myself - I am actually looking forward to Dabangg 2. Films like Khiladi 786 can do that to you. With a Salman Khan product, the least you can expect is a few decent action sequences, oh-so-silly action comedy and if all else fails at the very least the production values won't remind you of loud TV shows. And of course, without a doubt I expect a lot more people in the audience who are having fun in a Salman Khan film.Interestingly, none of the trailers I found had much of an inkling to what the movie is going to be about. That either means, the plot is a well-guarded secret or there is none. I know which way I'm inclining towards. But, the official synopsis  does imply that the "story" is going to continue from where we left off in Dabangg. It's nice to finally see a sequel which is actually a sequel versus being a mere cash-in on a wannabe franchise name in Hindi cinema, after such a long time. While I am yet again going to try my best to enjoy Dabangg 2 for what it is, I doubt my needs for sense within the parameters set by the film are going to be met. Not to mention, 'Zandu balm' gives way to 'Fevicol' in sending out creeps. Kareena's item number - Fevicol adds to my stress by giving me one more song to oppose when kids I know are asked to perform on stage. This is one instance where I will let the label 'high-brow' stick to me. I'm sure the tune is peppy and the song very hummable, but the lyrics... shakes head in despairAnyway, the music reviews seem to suggest that the sequel's music pretty much sticks to expectations. I hope the film goes beyond. I'm curious to see which way the change of director from Abhinav Kashyap to Arbaaz Khan takes the next episode of Chulbul Pandey. Music Reviews:
Milliblog - "The sequel’s soundtrack is a faithful follow-up – a bit too annoyingly faithful, at times."
Music Aloud - "6.5/10"
dunkdaft - "Though with all the tried tested formula tunes - it works perfectly for this masala sequel."
Bollywood Hungama - "4/5"
Bollyspice - "3.5/5"
Apun Ka Choice - "3/5"
Happy Sing - "Overall, Dabangg 2, the album, is the sequel you were waiting for. Hope the movie follows."

  The best part about a Salman Khan film is the herd of Salmaniacs you are surrounded by. Oh, the whistles, the cheers, the non-stop cackle and overall enthusiasm. I would get through many a Salman film just to be in the middle of that  kind of energy. And Dabangg 2 didn't have even that! The crowd was surprisingly cold except for the mandatory excitement at grand-entry time and during the songs. But, usually the songs get more out of the fans. The first in this series,  Dabangg had teenage girls in the audience dancing to the background music of the final fight sequence. Here it was restricted to general cheering and hooting. Since I don't get the mania anyway, and am very unlikely to enjoy the film by itself, my only barometer is the audience reaction - which was rather underwhelming.The introductory action sequence feels like a recap of  Dabangg and you wait for something new and fun in terms of action to come up soon. You keep waiting. There is nothing new or funny about them, they are just repetitive. Only this time, the sound design does the 'action' rather than the usual camera and/or editing. In the name of action choreography, people fall here, there and everywhere in the same old fashion. In stead you are served one song after another, a few obviously inserted to give the feeling that Sonakshi Sinha had something to do. And in one she was even pitted against Malaika Arora Khan, which I didn't quite understand. Was it some way of making the contrast in terms of looks and dancing skills even more apparent?Let's not waste our breath over story, it's the same old cop, up against the goon-turned-politician. Only this one is conveniently honest so that he can be Robin-Hood-cum-Kungfu-Panda. Interestingly, the other cops too are all honest and want to do the right thing. This version of Bollywood cop though is soon amalgamating into one, only the 'star' playing him changes - from Dabangg to Singham to Rowdy Rathore this police officer is fusing together and one is difficult to tell apart from the other. That two of these have Sonakshi Sinha as lead lady and two have Prakash Raaj as villain doesn't make it easier. Of the lot, Prakash Raaj and to an extent Vinod Khanna try their best to bring life to their characters. The rest are just doing the drill, ably led by Salman Khan. Is it not disconcerting to the Salman fan that his playback singer, Sukhwinder Singh is singing his soul out while he barely moves his lips for lip-sync? How is that cool? So, Salman Khan continues to adorn his 'acting' with an attitude of nonchalance. He gets to play silly pranks which can slide by as cute.Speaking of silly, the silliest gets sillier here and you are left with no choice but give it a laugh. Yet, the dialogue and especially the one-liners, save maybe one or two, carry no weight. Not even those repeat lines given to characters in order to define them, a la 'aata maajhi satakli' or  Dabangg's own 'chhed'. 
To top it off the relatively funnier lines of the lot are repeated to push them down your throat and make sure you 'got' them. However, I did enjoy the language a lot. 'Clean' Hindi is indeed refreshing, even if it sounds fake and forced.I know a Salman Khan film is no place for me. But, I really do love being in a theater, especially if there is hope of a lively audience. Here's hoping it will work the next time around like it did in Dabangg. Oh yes, there will be a Dabangg 3.ps. Yes, yes, ladies (and gentlemen) the shirt comes off.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Robin-Hood Pandey (Salman Khan) is in Kanpur to clean the town of its dirty goons and politicians.
Robin-Hood Pandey (Salman Khan) is in Kanpur to clean the town of its dirty goons and politicians.

That Chulbul Pandey (Salman Khan) and co are chewing on raw tamarind. For some reason, it was funny.
Vinod Khanna's performance in the park scene where Chulbul Pandey responds to his fears.
The Police Department's uprightedness. You do wish this film somehow inspired a few police officers to work for the common man.

The drumroll that builds-up to indicate a Salman entry. In fact, the background music throughout serves as a cue to the emotion you are supposed to feel. Pretty annoying. Not to mention slapsticky sound effects to induce laughter.
The promise by Salman Khan and a female reporter that we should expect a lot of fun!
The knuckle dance.
The product placement was outright disgusting.
The transfer of sunglasses from Sonakshi Sinha to Salman Khan.
Even for a film of this caliber, why would a witness wait to make a call before going to the court?
The facade of women's lib.
The comedy made out of a midget and lame person.
The [*DDLJ*](http://wogma.com/article/revisiting-ddlj/ "Essay on Dilwale Dulhaniya le Jayenge") references.
Acting by the man who plays Bachcha Bhaiya's (Prakash Raaj's) guru 
Makhhi Singh's (Arbaaz Khan's) track in the story.
You've got a terrific sense of humour :)I doubt if Dabanng 2 has a solid storyline and a plot,but I guess 'Fevicol', PJs and action sequences will have the aam junta glued to their seats.Ha ha @Shreeja, you think so? I have a feeling my sense of humor is not going to be good enough to enjoy Dabangg 2. ;)@Dattaprasad he he...as long as I don't mind the professional hazards, all's well, I guess ;)@Velagyan yep, for better or for worse, that is the only question... :)@Salman Khan thank you! Love your name ;)You and me definitely watched it with a different audience :) In my theater, I couldn't hear the dialog for the first fifteen minutes due to the noise from the crowd and during the 'Fevicol' song I couldn't see the screen as everyone was up and dancing on the seats!! And almost for the entire duration of the movie I had a crazy grin on my face :D Its an experience that I would pay for any day no matter how many he repeats the same formula. Back late from the show it was almost midnight with nary a soul awake. I made myself some hot soup and watched 'Salmon fishing in the Yemen', end to a perfect day :)Direction: 2    Story: 0.5    Lead Actors: 2    Character Artists: 0.5    Dialogues: 2    Screenplay: 0.5    Music Director: 1.5    Lyrics: 1@moscow - "Same thing everytime"- i agree.@Gautam - oh lovely! That's what I was looking forward to! And I agree with "Its an experience that I would pay for any day no matter how many he repeats the same formula." Doesn't make me like the film any more or less, but enriches the experience, nevertheless.@Suman I hear ya!Power pack action film... Salman keeps you glued to the seat…  To book the tickets download Dabangg2 Mobile app from Google store and Apple store...@Meetu - you know, DABANGG is playing at my local multiplex in upstate New York! We were all really surprised to see a masala show up right next to THE HOBBITT and DJANGO UNCHAINED - and we'd be delighted, if it weren't a Salman Khan vehicle....@TimELiebe Oh well, at least it is a start. :)...A pistol in hand is more than he can ask for, to fight 20 odd beasts (no one questions why they won't get him all together instead of trying their luck one by one); a spin of his arm gets his opponent down in one fell swoop; his presence most times, is enough to scare away the scariest looking brutes. He's as macho fighting the goons as romancing his wife with all the smirkish liveliness and the giggles, that by the way, does not make you balk. It only makes you fall more in love with this Chulbul 'charming' Pandey... http://eatpraylovemovies.blogspot.in/2012/12/back-with-dabangg.html...A pistol in hand is more than he can ask for, to fight 20 odd beasts (no one questions why they won't get him all together instead of trying their luck one by one); a spin of his arm gets his opponent down in one fell swoop; his presence most times, is enough to scare away the scariest looking brutes.
