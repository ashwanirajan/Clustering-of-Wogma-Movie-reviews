A thriller which tries hard to be way too much more. A spy has been planted in Pakistan for nine years and it is now time for him to bring the terrorists residing them down. That spy is played by Irrfan Khan. What looks like the leader of a terrorist group or at least an arms dealer claims that he is only a businessman. That leader is played by Rishi Kapoor.Add to the mix Huma Qureshi and Arjun Rampal, and we are pretty much set for a very interesting mix of actors. They all look pensive, they all look like they mean business. The plot too is intriguing with the terrorism angle. Let's just hope that it doesn't go jingoist on us or become too one-sided. Last but the most interesting bit is that D-Day is directed by Nikhil Advani. From the trailers at least, it doesn't look anything like what Nikhil Advani has done before. We've either seen him make half-decent romance or nonsense. Nothing that anyone could've taken too seriously. D-Day does come across as an intense film that is all set to evoke a lot of emotion, only not the lovey-dovey kind. Music Reviews:
Bollyspice - "2.5/5" 
Bollywood Hungama - "2.5/5" 
glamsham - "3.5/5" 
Milliblog - "The trio nail the sound as usual, even if the tunes work only intermittently." 
Music Aloud - "8/10"

  A bomb blasts, you  are disturbed. You want to do something about it but feel helpless and lost. We rant about it, we complain about the administration. Bloggers blog about it. And filmmakers, well, at least some of them make films to present their point of view. D-Day ultimately, comes across as a filmmakers rant. Writer-director Nikhil Advani sets up his characters in a rather dull manner. You know their sad stories, but you don't really care for them, till interval point. At break time, the twist suddenly makes you wonder what will happen to these characters. Thereafter though, instead of piquing the build-up, the narrative flattens. The pace of the action film slackens into moments of reflections by the characters. This is a shame because the turmoil of the male lead characters is played out really well. Thematically, this starts off with wonderful editing between a R&AW mission and a song at a wedding. But, when such treatment is juxtaposed with the film's larger theme, the pace becomes very uneven. Uneven writing doesn't help the cause. Loyalties change; enemies find out each others' moves and companions; the incredible happens, just out of nowhere. Towards the end, D-Day comes across more as a fantasy of what ought to happen in the real world than trying to keep it real. Interestingly, the climax seems to be talking simultaneously to our administration of what they ought to do and to the terrorists warning them against what we could be capable of. And what about that is not going to go down well with the audience?A very capable Irrfan Khan and a flat-but-effective performance by Arjun Rampal are D-Day's high points. Rishi Kapoor does whatever he's asked to do with ease. Unfortunately, his character isn't menacing enough to give him room to instill fear. Huma Qureshi barely makes her presence felt. You really wonder if there is a reason other than equal representation in a spy team, for her to be included. Shruti Haasan, on the other hand, has a better, more meaningful role. Interestingly, her performance seems effective when she has shorter lines. Beyond a line or two and her accent begins to falter, which makes it very distracting.The number of songs, even while they play in the background are too many and slow down the proceedings considerably. The film lingers too much for an action film. Post-interval, the plot goes haywire and the editing loses grip except for a few sequences. Even in those wonderful sequences, it stretches a bit longer than optimum - enough to make you impatient.D-Day wants to be a stylish take on the psyche of the martyrs of this country while also trying to make a larger point about how terrorism ought to be handled. And, it also wants to be a thriller. Too much on one plate.

AmareshMisra:
          D-Day a surprisingly effective spy thriller from N Advani. But shows Dawood behind Bomb blasts in India. Bias. What about 1992-93 riots?

: u can watch this movie twice,,,,but not in theaters
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.waitingMeetu , i was expecting the movie ever since the trailer was released :(  , u know Irfan Khan playing another intriguing character ( Paan Singh Tomar). I rarely disagree with ur review but i hope this time it does when i go to the theatre !.First half was a bit lame , i found the second half really enjoyable. The characters were impressive , except Shurti which i  felt was forcedly used.  It was also a good effort on the director part to emotionally involve its characters.@Anup have you seen it then?@guddu I'm glad you enjoyed it :DMeetu - yes I have seen it,,,,the movie starts really well,,,,with duma dum mast kalandar,,,,and the blast happens,,,,then the back stories of the charaters come,,,,it was good in the first half,,,,but the post interval part the pace was very slow,,,,editing is bad,,,,the scenes where they just sit an think wht to do nxt are boring,,,,there are interesting twist in between but are not enough to make the second half wholly entertaining....The character irfaan and arjun have played were very good,,,,including irfaan's wife also(i dont know her name),,,,the sond alvida is awsome,,,,and shruti show her love and pain in it in a superb manner,,,,the song ek ghadi was boring and not necessary....the character rishi have played was not so inpressive as goldman,,,,and it was not his fault,,,,....But the climax made me happy,,,,as u said it shows what should happen in place of what really happen....If editing would have been sharp movie could easily be 10-15 min less,,,,....Crime thriller is my fav genre  so I have expected more from this movie with bunch of very good actors in it,,,,it fall short of my expectation....I watched this on my laptop over a train ride from Ajmer to New Delhi in chair car seat with my headphones on. The movie had it ups and downs and after the movie ended I didn't know what to do. Weather to find flaws in the movie or wish that dream to come true.I am writing this review after 4 days of watching this movie. Had this been on TV I would have skipped it. The movie starts with a bang and a peppy number but drags in the middle then it picks up after post interval but drags at the end. But I am glad I watched it. It might not be a perfect movie either story wise or direction wise but its a good attempt.I will surely not watch the movie again but I am sure I won't forget it anytime soon. And BTW Rishi Kapoor plays a pretty awesome Goldman :).@Anup, @Nishant thank you for your reviews. :DCopyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
