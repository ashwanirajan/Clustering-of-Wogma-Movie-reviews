Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster is a decent political thriller. But, it would have worked so much better if the characters had engaged us emotionally. Yet, the dialogues and the general flow of the film makes it worth a DVD watch.Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster creates a mystic aura around itself. It has the ambience of the heartland where princes still reign their now unofficial kingdoms with pride. With this background, though the story is of the same ol' politics and deceit.

Like any good thriller, Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster manages to make you consider the motivations of each character in turn, however small their role in the scheme of things. That is what keeps you engaged. Though it would have gotten us involved a lot more if we were involved with the characters of the film. These characters - be it the king (Saheb), the queen (Biwi), the servant who happens to be a gangster, or the other people around these three main characters - have strong reactions and we are given a glimpse of the justification for their reactions, but not once can we feel why the reaction was so strong. 
For example, each of the three main characters are shown to be madly in love and that seems to be the motivation behind their strong actions and reactions. But, the only way you know they are in love is because they are having sex with the person they are supposedly in love with. Other than that, there is no clue left of their love. The emotional connect needed to get the gravity of the behavior is missing. 
And yet, based on just the thriller element of the film, the curiosity of what will happen next exists. That curiosity does wane with the progress of the film because of way-too-many double-crossing and double-double-crossing characters. But still, its not a half bad thriller. A lot of the credit goes to the witty dialogue and its delivery. 
There is something inherently aristocratic about Jimmy Sheirgill and that works towards making his character the required amount of arrogant and vulnerable that princes in today's times are. Randeep Hooda and Mahie Gill are just about functional. Given the film revolves around their sensuality, I wonder if the film would have worked better if there were actors with more oomph value, especially Mahie Gill.
Also, given how much of the film revolves around attraction, seduction and sensuousness, those scenes are shot with the standard Indian awkwardness making you wonder why the characters are attempting to make love when they are so uncomfortable with the very idea. 
With all that's wrong with Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster, it is still a half-interesting watch. Only makes you wonder, what a wonderful film it would have been had it got even a little more right.

          Saheb, Biwi Aur Gangster is an overrated film. Nothing new in the script or story. Good performances by the actors though

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Aditya Singh (Jimmy Sheirgill) is struggling for power in what used to once be his father's kingdom. He is not interested in his wife (Mahie Gill) who is suffering from some mental illness because of an event in her past. There is a new driver (Randeep Hooda) in the picture who also happens to be a gangster and has his own political motivations in the mix.

The background music that goes with the morose/gory opening sequence.
The dilemma created in the politician's office - between the Chief Minister's call and Aditya Singh wanting to visit the bathroom.

Suman - Aditya Singh's right-hand man's daughter is damn annoying. Given the three scenes she is in, she is loud and irritating - totally out of place with the rest of the tone of the film.
This is a entertaining movie. I saw it on 1st day. Its just awesome. Mahie Gill is looking so beautiful.Worth a watch on the screen. Don't go with your kids or parents though :)one of the most sensible review sites on planet...great going !!Thank you, Nitin!@Abhijeet Like you, I react a certain way when I watch a film. You could call it my bias, but I define bias like this - I am an Amitabh Bachchan fan, so I'll like everything that he does irrespective of the quality of the writing of the film, etc. About love and sex - the characters reacted so strongly to "adultery" in their relationship, but it never came across as they had very strong emotions about the person who cheated. I found an imbalance between how they seemed to treat the relationship and how they reacted. I didn't hate the film, but I didn't love it either. It is, like I said, a good DVD watch, nothing that you need to rush to the theaters for.@Suman Good to know. People liked it a lot more than that and I was wondering if I was the only one who didn't think it was ok-ok!must watch saheb biwi gangster 2... excellent proformance... wow what acting, hats off to the crew.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
