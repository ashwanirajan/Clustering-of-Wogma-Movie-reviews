You brace yourself for the highest degrees of scathing cynicism when you walk in to a film about India's election process. You walk out with a smile that balances the skepticism with healthy hopefulness. Those are just a few “when was the last time that happened” packed in 100+ minutes.Election in India. The process of election in India. The process of election in the interiors of India.  The concept itself is intriguing. Added on rooted performances, cinematography and insightful dialogue make it a film I feel like watching right away. It has been ages since I felt so eager to watch a film.Like any film with a social cause on agenda these two fears loom though – fear of repetition to hammer the cause down and fear of being preached to. Like any other trailer that excites me I am always wary that I have seen all the interesting bits in the trailer.Let's hope my fears are unfounded.Newton releases on 18 August, 2017.
    - meeta, a part of the audience
  Nothing that happens in Newton is really surprising. We know, more or less, how things work. The beauty is that you realise what you already know, as it unfolds in the film. This detailed unrevealing is what makes Newton a unique experience. This isn't an experience that glorifies the natural beauty of the forests of central India with its camera-work. There are no slickly designed action sequences that make it a must watch in the theater. It is the writing, the narration and the performances that make me want to watch it again. Of course, the film is pleasant to the eye and the action is real. But, the real hook is the sinking feeling that you are fighting. You know things are going to only get worse and ironically, you want to stay optimistic. And you are smiling through it all.The conspicuous absence of satire is very satisfying. The humor comes from the situations and the everyday cynicism that fits in exactly at the place it is found at, in real life. Also, rarely does a film that takes on so many facets of life, does justice to all of them. A running theme through the film is the struggle between idealism and reality. This struggle is multiplied as our indignant, honest protagonist, Newton (Rajkummar Rao) meets the outright corrupt who patronize and humor him, till they realise they have to concede. You know why this latter group has a smirk on, as they watch Newton's realisation of the many-layered challenges in getting tribals to cast their vote in an election - villagers who live in abject poverty and are caught between the devil and the deep sea. Even after a few hours of having left the theater, I am in awe at the arm's distance the film maintains from taking a skeptical route. At times, it is indeed difficult to not scoff at Newton's borderline anal, righteousness. Yet, you are concerned for him when he calls out pseudo-nationalism even though it is a well-placed joke. You want to talk practical sense into him as he takes on the entitlement that the army-men feel. Just imagine, frail and meek Rajkummar Rao taking on Jack Nicholson in A Few Good Men. Yes, that scary. Because here, Atmaram (Pankaj Tripathi), the officer in charge of guarding the election officer's team could beat our protagonist brutally with good support from the rest of the characters. What's scarier is that the former might have support from a few in the audience too. It is no mean feat, to get an audience invested in as uni-dimensional a character as Newton. You are that involved. That too when half the film is about a few men and one woman waiting for voters to show up. This part makes for a good chunk of this crisp, 100+ minute film and yet it doesn't feel like the pace has slackened. The only place that film feels like it's slipping is towards the end - an act of desperation that is uncharacteristic of the film so far. Fortunately, it recovers with one of the best climaxes I have seen in Hindi films. There is also a song that might seem out of place. While watching it though, it felt like an intentional move to highlight the farcical proceedings of the election process. Also you realise that it wouldn't be surprising if a video like that went viral in real life.So, we have come to the point I have been avoiding – the performances. What can one can say when every single actor is perfectly cast? It would be newsworthy only if Rajkummar Rao or Pankaj Tripathi failed us with their act. Anjali Patil makes an adivasi girl's indifference understandable and you can't complain when Raghubir Yadav's quirks bring out a laugh. Sanjai Mishra in his bit role is adorable. Even Mukesh Prajapati as Shambhoo has a screen presence about him despite his silence.Newton must have been a tough film to make at many levels. The bravado needed, to approach the topic or its details, to take a gentle stab at misplaced national pride, is obvious. But, it also isn't easy to write a story around the election process on election day and not make it cynically preachy, a civics lesson or documentary-like. That is like dodging three bullets coming at you. To survive the temptations and tell a story of a relatively uni-dimensional protagonist, in a crisp, immersive film is challenging, to say the least. I feel the need to visit this film again and have my kids watch it too – because this is a once in the blue moon film, the details of which, cannot be digested in one viewing.

But then if we want to make a difference we can’t remain indifferent....

        ...Despite being the most diverse and complex democracy in the world, India’s election system has its own highlights and problems. Newton addresses the fact that the right to cast a vote means everything to an individual in a country like ours. When it gets down to drawing parallels between city slickers like Newton and jungle dwellers like the naxals and the tribals it is at its most brilliant. Newton presents everyday life in the most intimate and interesting way. Its comedy is on par with classics like Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro and yet it has the real grit of a Mohan Joshi Hazir Ho. Funny, relevant and deeply gratifying, Newton is a veritable modern classic....

        ...Indeed, the movie's sobering themes, its portrayal of apathy for the state of the Indian democracy, and the reckless insensitivity portrayed for the plight of the brave men and women of the CRPF brigade and the downtrodden folk of the Adivasi community all act as stark reminders of the privileged existence most of us city folk lead. Even as our 24-hour news channels indignantly scream about the loss of lives of innocent jawans or the state of panic citizens find themselves in as their basic human rights are trampled upon, the unshakable feeling that there are only a few members of society who are truly capable of facilitating change becomes wholly apparent. A change that requires generations to materialise because the men and women who truly care about and are capable of facilitating it are few and far between, and in a country of over a billion people, their work requires time to percolate....

Hell, yeah. That way, Newton packs a full-ton, and deserves full marks!...

But there’s also a cussedness and obstinacy to him, a headstrong quality in the way he sticks to his principles that make Newton seem like the new Gandhi, the inner Mahatma that needs to come alive.
