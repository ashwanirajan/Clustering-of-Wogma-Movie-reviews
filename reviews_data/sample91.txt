
wogma rating: Beg or borrow, but do watch (?)
An ode to unrequited love and its victims. Reminds them to bask in their one-sided love's glory. The film slices and dices emotional relationships in many, many ways. Watch but please not with cynical unromantics. Friendship that turns into love though it can predict the heartbreak. Can there be a more soul-sucking theme than that? Must be dementors at work, right? Karan Johar picks all these themes that sound like they involve a lot of soul-searching. And then, the execution, the story just is a broad stroke and thus disappointing. This time however, the trailer promises more. It promises some wonderful performances. Just that one shift of expression in Anushka Sharma's eye at minute 1:20 made my heart skip a beat. All her pain and disbelief captured instantaneously, before the character could mask it. And of course, Ranbir Kapoor's “I'm hurt, so I will hurt you with my look” look has always been a killer. Add on, Fawad Khan's voice and more. The only vulnerability in the performances might be Aishwarya Rai as femme fatale. The trailer unfortunately gives away a lot of the movie. It made me wonder what is left for me to discover. Just which man and woman get together isn't remotely exciting enough. That leaves us with the details of how the relationships are built, go through strain and the various interactions. Actually, if done well, this would be more than enough for what one has come to expect from Karan Johar films.

  Ae Dil Hai Mushkil gives one-sided lovers hope. Not the kind that says, "ask for something with all your will, and the entire universe shall conspire to make it happen". Ae Dil Hai Mushkil gives those stuck in unrequited love the hope that says, it's ok. Because it's yours. And because it's yours it's beautiful.I could go on and on about how Ae Dil Hai Mushkil has embraced and comforted relationships whole-heartedly. I want to go on and on. But let me get the unwanted out of the way first. The film does some very avoidable things. Some films use voice-overs; others use a character as a narrator; yet others have long-standing friends talk like strangers for the audience's benefit - all annoying tools; all indicators of lack of confidence in the script. This one uses an interview. *eyeroll* - *whatever* - *shrug off* - *move on*. Then you have one too many film-y references, even if they are masked under characters who are self-confessing "Bollywood fantasy-livers". They are just about well-placed and stop before they get too many. Could they have cut down the 45 minutes beyond 2 hours? I bet, yes. Tributes, spoofs – notwithstanding. It also has the laziest cop-out out of a love triangle that writers take. A few more *eyerolls* and *oh-nos!* directed towards the writers. You also have the drop in pace in the first half. The couple of scenes after the "break-up song" saw my heart sink after an otherwise decent-ish start. It started treading towards the usual Karan Johar territory - tacky, slapsticky, and over-the-top. It thinks it is clutching at your heart, but it isn't quite there. But it completely recovers from this fall in the second half, even if after a couple of slips.Had we known that this was the love triangle Karan Johar was struggling for all these years, we would have held our curses a bit through Kuch Kuch Hota Hai's superficial and simplistic take on love, Kabhie Khushi Kabhie Gham's devotion to family, Kabhi Alvida Na Kehna's cringe-inducing take on extra-marital affairs and so on. Ae Dil Hai Mushkil doesn't go far from the one-line plot, but it goes deeper, much deeper. Through various characters in these films, he has fleetingly touched upon the various kinds of love he has brought together in Ae Dil Hai Mushkil. There's the love that exists yet can't resist the temptations of lust. There's love that's so self-aware that it refuses to fall into the trap yet another time and goes into self-preservation mode - pronto. Then you have love that is too precious to want to be lovers - friend-zoned, if you will. Alongside is the love that has lost all self-respect in the gamble. The mightiest of them all - the love that wants, nae demands reciprocation - 100% reciprocation. And they aren't mutually exclusive either. But, through this Ae Dil Hai Mushkil wants to say just one thing - it is all still love. Just different from one another. Clearly the focus is the different forms love takes and not things that mortals have to worry about like – earning a livelihood, having other responsibilities and so on. The writers even write it off with a scene that declares them rich kids. Now, if you have a problem with rich kids who have difficulty dealing with their heartaches, you want to watch another film. The understanding of and maturity in relationships is all they want to talk about. It could have gone all awry if it wasn't articulated well in words and their translation to film. From the captain of the boat to the different cogs that make a film work. This is not a film where one character is oblivious to the feelings of the other when it is so obvious. They are what people do in real life – in denial. The film is sprinkled with actual conversations, something I find lacking in Hindi romantic films. The dialogue is snappy and you could miss out a witticism here and a good line there if you don't pay keen attention. The two outbursts, one each by Ranbir Kapoor and Anushka Sharma, hit target - they are brilliantly worded, well-timed and enacted with conviction. One expresses the helplessness of having failed after trying everything to get over, to move on, to find a moment of peace. The other is a frustrated expression of a different perspective on love. And then there is a scene with wonderfully written lines for a cameo. If only the actor had played a character and not a charismatic personality which reminds us of the real-life star who wants to pass on the “romantic hero” baton. Aishwarya Rai does femme fatale beautifully. Ranbir Kapoor holds the screen well, especially in close-ups. Something, I've admired Amitabh Bachchan do. Even though his pain-ridden eyes are all too familiar, they leave their impact. Again. Though there are times he goes over-the-top, something we rarely see him do. So, I'd blame the director. I absolutely love the way Anushka Sharma has grown into the roles she takes on - bringing an uncanny reality about them. Ranbir Kapoor and Anushka Sharma together too, make every bit of their relationship relatable. The ladies do goof up their diction every once in a while. And Fawad Khan's character is almost inconsequential to convince me about the hullabaloo caused by his presence in the film.I am divided about watching this film again. My heart was beating hard while walking out of the theater for having watched a solid, good film. Enough for me to want to walk into the next show right away. But, what if I don't like what I liked about the film as much as I did in first go? I think I am eager to find out.

It is not without its faults by any means. The characters are borderline frustrating and the second half is very heavy on the heart. Inspite of all that, Ae Dil Hai Mushkil flows fluidly and entertains all the way through. The music doesn’t provide a hindrance and the acting elevates the drama. Any and every lover of Indian classical movies should check out this classical tale of romance in a modern garb called Ae Dil Hai Mushkil.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Boy meets girl. One loves the other romantically, the other well, kind-a, sort-a pretty much doesn't.Boy meets girl. One loves the other romantically, the other well, kind-a, sort-a pretty much doesn't.
It is interesting that a song from the 90s – when I was growing up – is now used to induce nostalgia, as a classic. Especially since it is used along with songs from 50s-60s that were used in films from 90s for the same effect.   
The scene with two women talking about the same man – with Yash Chopra-ish finesse.   
The following scene with awkward silence.   

The occasional product placement (Saavn).   
A reaction to a cheating partner.   
The TV serial spoof.   
Now this is a movie that the makers would be better off putting in the freezer for some time till things cool off with a rogue state called Pakistan.  Shrewd and selfish business attitudes will portray the businessmen as peaceniks and messengers of love and peace, and urge all to watch the film.  It is up to the smart crowd to see through such pretenses and recognize the shameless undermining of national policy, policy that is aimed at permanently resolving a major security issue.  On one hand the country in its vast and diverse majority wants the entire world to hit Pakistan with sanctions, and on the other hand shrewd businessmen want exceptions made to sanctions for selfish personal financial gains.I register my protest against Dharma and all other who believe personal financial interests are higher than the sacrifices made by families of brave soldiers in giving the luxury and freedom with which Dharma can go about living their lives.  A strict no for this film.If Shivaay beats Ae Dil Hai Mushkil in its worldwide collections, I will leave wogma. I challenge Anuj to do the same should the opposite happen.Lol Youngistaan ruling over 1991 star. Hahahaha. Footfalls tracked by box office india for ADHM/Shivaay is 11:5 .Footfall 11:5 only in Delhi/NCR, Mumbai/Pune, Chandigarh/Mohali. Mass circuits is exactly the opposite. Just like it was for SOS over JTHJ. Infactuated fangirls and roadside romeos would never chane taste, right from the times of the over rated DDLJ's, KKHH's to the times of outright trash like YJHD and ADHM.And of course its a different matter that the ever so secular (to the extent of shooting themselves on the foot) Hindus would provide equal footfalls to Khan's , Kumar's and Devgan's while the "not so minority" audience would outrightly boycott Shivaay only for its name and watch Sultan and PK 5 times over, but that's a different matter altogether.Talking about one sided love, I may have fallen in love with Meeta for this review.Shivaay 8.25crAe Dil Hai Mushkil 13.25crDespite MNS and internet troll threats. If not for Uri attacks Shivaay would have been less than 5.8cr. There will be destruction this diwali, perhaps self destruction for Shiver.Some people who bashed Ra One, Veer and Kites are in respiratory distress (The Devgun fans).4 cr difference in nett collection with just a 2.5 Lakh difference in footfalls. That too with the mass entertainer being impacted the most due to pre Diwali festivities. This is what happens when paid cronies of powerful production houses coupled with rich urban multiplex brats and braindead fangirls of chocolate heroes gang up in favor of one film against another. We witnessed something similar in 2012 when both JTHJ and SOS recorded similar footfalls, yet the media portrayed JTHJ to be a "clear winner" (lol). And of course, who can forget the media's endless rants about DDLJ being India's biggest blockbuster despite recording 2 crore lower footfall than HAHK (not that the criminal from a certain "minority community" deserves such viewership).ha ha ha ha @ehinome I take that as a compliment. **aadaab**The centres that supported Bajirao Mastani are supporting Ae Dil Hai Mushkil. Monday will show the aukaat of Anti Pak viewers, lol bhakts and multiplex viewers are not on the same page as Dilwale vs Bajirao Mastani. When audience watched BM they were wise, they have become unwise for watching ADHM. love no matter how mushy is still better than destruction, oops destruction of Shiva with a y(a character that makes fun of Linga and Shiva by indulging in unwarranted kissing and fornication). Only anti hindus and anti Pak muslims will support Shiva with a y.This Diwali is for Ae Dil Ki Diwali though an above average affair. A clean romantic film is better than a horny action film for family audiences.Bribing film critics is better than retrospectively abeiting killing of Jawans by showing fake solidarity.Some think having a good trailer is the same as having a good film, the people who praised Shivaay's trailer are the same multiplex viewers and overseas audience. Devgn has lost out due to his unethical gimmicks but he forgot KJo is no Chopra be it Yash or Aditya, yeah KJo got dirty in a smart way by roping SRK into his film just like Dev did with Salman for Son of Sardaar.This time Salman kept quiet despite Ranbir romancing his ex girlfriend.Those people supporting Shivaay on IMDb are bhakts and MNS supporters. The longest finger will be thrown into their mouths this Diwali. Enough of nonsense by the Thackerays and their ilk.Look at this brainwashed secular/minority ranting his mouth off at a mere movie! This is the precise problem with the "majority" population of this nation. Most of them are either Nehruvian brainwashed commies who would support the thought that "art has no boundaries" and continue watching mushy romantic nonsense like YJHD and ADHM produced by corporate czars. The "majority" Hindu population would be split wide open between ADHM and Shivaay with mushy romantic noob girls and their romeo bf's preferring ADHM while the action junkies and one's looking for innovation preferring Shivaay. However, no such disparity among the "minorities" as they would obviously watch ADHM (even if they do not like the genre/film) only 'coz the other film's name is "Shivaay" and ADHM's been produced by the "partner" of a Khan. Damn easy to split up the excessively tolerant "majority" for the pseudo seculars and "minorities" with vested interests.To put it bluntly, our Hindi movie watching audience can be divided into an 80:20 ratio with 80% being the Hindus (coupled with Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs etc) and the 20% being the "minorities". Among this 80%, Shivaay would find favor among a good 60% of them, mainly from the interiors such as Rajasthan, MP, UP, Bihar, Gujarat and CP Berar. However, despite finding favor among the 60% Hindus, the low ticket prices in mass centers would ensure a lower figure for Shivaay as opposed to ADHM which would find favor among the 40% urban pseudo liberals and tolerant communist influenced intelligentsia along with bimbette fan-girls and romeo fan-boys. Despite being a 40% minority among the Hindus, the collections of ADHM would be significantly higher as most of this 40% comes from urban centers like Delhi/NCR, Mumbai/Pune, Bangalore and Kolkata. Add to that the 20% minorities who would not watch Shivaay at any cost and we have a 52:48 viewership/footfall ratio in favor of ADHM and a 65:35 ratio in terms of box office collections. All this hold true till Tuesday after which its all dependent on word of mouth for both the films among all sections of the audience.If Shivaay crosses 105cr as per boi figures, i will not eat for 2 days.Ae Diwali Ki Mushkil.After supporting Dilwale and Mohenjodaro, it feels good to lead and possibly win.Some people playing the religion card, so shameful. Which youngistaan star except Imran Khan is a muslim. These Muslims won the hearts of their fans by their talent, charisma, and hardwork not like HR and AD who need vote bank viewership.Vote bank viewership helped KNPH demolish "Phir bhi dil hai Pakistani" and "Mela" as a rank newcomer, give Mission Kashmir a bigger opening than Mohabbatein, deliver Bollywood's most successful sci-fi/superhero franchise which stood the test of time for over a decade, exponentially increase the value of the Dhoom franchise by 3 times, deliver Hindi cinema's most successful historical of the decade (unlike A-Mangal Pandey and A-dhoka). Darn, even ZNMD was a bigger commercial success than DCH...lol :PAnuj and Fan...Did you guys consider the SMALL possibility that the audience is disinterested and tired of watching masala films with glorified heroes single handedly taking on multiple villains???I personally liked Bahubali and can't wait for the second part manily because the first film was actually 'fun and entertaining' which Shivaay doesn't look like.Considering the all round bvad reviews Shivaay is getting doesn't help it's cause either.On the other hand,ADHM had superb music,presence of Karan Johar which guaranteed that the movie would be at least entertaining(His worst,Student of the Year was at least entertaining and watchable than the 'Masala entertainers' Rohit shetty and Prabhudeva make.)And Ranbir Kapoor is a plus considering the guy gives superb performances even in terrible movies.So it isn't a surprise that many people who isn't a fan of Ajay Devgn favouring ADHM.@Gokul : So a masala movie with word class action and brilliant camerawork/cinematography is a done to death formula while the same old Karan Johar nonsense that his production house has been dishing out for the last 20 years in fresh? Anyway, SHIVAAY will find more footfalls, if not collections as the audiences in the interiors would definitely prefer an action thriller than a romantic mushy pretty boy film. That would not show in the collections as ADHM would find an audience paying 4 times as that of Shivaay.Ae Dil Hai Mushkil will kill Shivaay everywhere except Thackeraypur.Ae Dil Hai Mushkil makes it to the top ten in the US weekend box office.  The second film from Bollywood in 2016.Youths will defeat buddhas at the boxoffice, so ADHM all the way.  If Amitabh's Te3n clashes with Salman's Ready, all kinds of viewers will watch Ready forgetting it has no story, but will campaign for Shivaay for showing us what?One of the rare occasions when I go to watch a movie just on wogma reco and don't like it (at all). A little too much over acting and unable to relate to story. Good songs. Aishwarya Rai's part was worth watching :)Its a total transformation of Karan Johar. The way of direction is nowhere close to old Karan Johar , he totally ignored the melodrama , even the most tragic scenes were turned into entertaining. Karan Johar is a very good director , the only thing needed that he would mold himself for the current generation of audience (which Yash Ji was not able to do in his last film) , and he did it. I guess producing movies like LUNCHBOX and KAPOOR & SONS have a positive effect on Karan. I find this movie totally fresh (not tried and tasted). Yes the story is not new , but the screenplay is awesome , direction and acting at its best , Anushka is the best thing about the film , but not a single actor disappoints , not even Lisa Haydon in her small role.Anybody who is judging it , without watching it that its just another Karan Johar usual film , is very very wrong.@Annkur ha ha ha. Like we say around here, "to each his own". But sad that you didn't like it. :)US Box Office (Opening Weekend)Ae Dil Hai Mushkil - $2.1mShivaay - $0.33mI am angry with YRF and SRK for not finishing this Flopmatwala.Someone said at a single screen where ticket fee is 10 rupees, Shivaay was running housefull and we were dancing the 2Rs dance in honour of Shivaay.Anuj and Ajax are the same person.The problems with the minority community is they look at everything with a religious eye. So, any rubbish dished out by the khans like chennai express and happy new year is lapped up by them. KJo, who seem to be in love with Shah Rukh, has practically become a muslim. So he is also supported. And they won't watch Shivaay because of the name.  Yet, despite all paid reviews of ADHM and anti-Shivaay reviews, the word of mouth is very strong for Shivaay and very bad for ADHM. So, despite all the negatives against Shivaay and positives for ADHM, even in boxoffice money collection, Shivaay is only 10% less than ADHM. Based on latest figures, it looks like Shivaay will overtake ADHM even in box office money collection. The multiplex audience has been so upset with ADHM that now they are going to watch Shivaay (and liking it), and Shivaay should be able to beat ADHM.Enjoying ADHM's victory this Diwali.Shivaay - 62crAe Dil Hai Mushkil - 78crI have been following wogma for years for two reasons. No-nonsense approach to rating, where rating is not linked to film's business.Parental Guidance - so that if I am watching the movie at home.My friend advised me that this movie is so-so. I just looked at your review and based on your score, decided to watch the movie. I   did not find it to be that appealing at all, which makes to wonder, if you guys are also influenced by producers or anybody else who has a financial motives, similar to new channels which are biased. And if my doubts are true, then this is a sad that everything is on sale in India be it news or opinion.I hope I am wrong and that there is something, I could not get.@NRI: Isn't it sad that if we disagree on a movie, we directly suspect integrity?I wish I am wrong and it is just a difference of opinion and no other consideration.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
