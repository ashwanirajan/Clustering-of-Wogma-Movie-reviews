Hichki questions traditional methods of teaching while using traditional film-writing, sort-of missing its own point. Thankfully, it is engaging while it lasts.Inclusivity gets double attention – in jobs and in education; of people with speech disabilities and  of people from a low-income background. And this is always welcome. The plot does look a lot similar to Freedom Writers with additional constraints for characters that could make it either very interesting or a tad too melodramatic. As it stand now, though, I am looking forward to it with a pinch of salt. At some point in the trailer it looked like the film is inching towards patronising. A good beginning is at least I don’t see Rani Mukerji break into song to overcome her speech disability. That’s one stereotype broken. Here’s hoping for more.Hichki releases on 23 March, 2018.Music Reviews:

  Much like Naina (Rani Mukerji) starts her class by addressing her speech difficulty upfront, Hichki begins with the exposition of Tourette’s syndrome and gets it out of the way. After that the film becomes more about a teacher’s struggle to bring her set of economically-underprivileged students up-to-speed with the rest of the students in that grade and a fight between old and new teaching mehods. In that sense, Hichki is about equal opportunity for those with speech difficulties and financial ones. Hichki questions our perceptions about disabilities. Hichki questions the very methods we use to teach. Hichki questions the elitist attitude towards education. Interestingly, the first is turned into a metaphor for everything that’s wrong with the other two. But, this would have worked if it was used once or twice in the film, the repeated use of Tourette as a metaphor everything that is wrong with a person’s thought process becomes tiring and maybe even beats the purpose of trying to sensitize the audience to the issue. Kudos to Hichki, to that effect, because it sensitizes the audience in other ways – by not letting the syndrome come in the way of Naina’s efforts with her students, by giving it little to no attention after the exposition, by letting it become just a part of a person’s regular being, Hichki makes the acceptance really smooth. As sad as it is, this acceptance works against the film because then it becomes a regular ol’ underdog film. There’s hardly any creativity in narrating that story. Also, characters that had potential to be interesting turn out to be rather predictable. It is holier-than-thou preachy versus smug nastiness. There are few insights but they are too fleeting to have an impact. On the other hand, I prefer fleeting to rub-it-in-your-face-to-make-sure-you-get-it (like the end credits eyeroll!) Similarly, other than the insights, insightful lines exist but they are few and far betweent too. In fact, post-interval the film becomes dialogue-heavy and over-written. This takes over the otherwise wonderful performances too. Except for Rani Mukerji, the rest of cast shifts gears while delivering the mouthful of dialogue, thankfully not enough to let us forget they are great actors. As for Rani Mukerji you forget that Naina is actually a character in a film and not an earnest, idealistic teacher and person, tic or no tic. A special shout out to the child artist who played Naina, she tore me up in her brief appearance. The post-interval syndrome is seen in narrative style too. I was beaming with happiness that Naina’s backstory wasn’t a voiceover but they actually weaved it in through story-showing rather than story-telling. But then they spoilt it by closing with a voiceover. Uggh. But then again, what is it that we can expect from ‘a rise of the underdog’ film? You can’t really have the underdog lose it all. If the underdog loses a bit and not all, we would say that was just a token loss. Yet, it is not too much to ask for a non-preachy, ‘you are so dumb to teach Math/Science this way’ approach. It is just another way of one group dehumanising and looking down at another group. In that sense, you can almost tell why the speech disability is important for the film – to distract you from the plain-ness of the story. And for the metaphors, of course.

        ...Also it scores some extra brownie points as we don’t have many Hindi films with a female lead character, made on the subject of school students, teachers and their relationship without going into the typical romantic zone as usual. Plus it indeed shows a great amount of thought put in while working out the detailing, specifically in the timing of making those unusual sounds and actions in between the given dialogues. And these two exclusive features of the film are nothing short of a worth appreciating achievement in the present scenario of Hindi Cinema in my personal opinion.

If the film is worth watching, it’s because of her  I and the generic feel-goodishness that invariably pleases audiences. There’s one remarkably offbeat aspect of Hichki though, Naina does not lean on man to help her, so there is no romantic track—she is the hero of her own story.

However, all credit to Rani as well as sensitive handling of sequences by Sidharth that it all comes across as rather natural on screen and you accept this syndrome as a part of the protagonist's personality rather than something that makes you take it as a joke.

          :
        
        ...It's been shot well, and Rani's angry helpless breakdown at school will bring tears to your eyes, but everything else is so sloppily written, you know how it is going to end. Yes, Sachin the dad comes around, the badly behaved kids call her their Pole Star, guiding light, the bad teacher realises his prejudices and all's well you think, but no! The filmmakers have watched Vinod Khanna's film Imtihan (1974) and want to give the same iconic tears and joy farewell to Naina Mathur as well... Rani Mukherji is a good actor, and to see her in this stereotypical high school film is a pity. This film is nice, but fails to touch your heart.

            by raj
: Great movie!
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.The story of a school teacher with a speech difficulty sets out to get some difficult students to study with a running theme of equal opportunity, be it a speech difficulty or a financial one. The story of a school teacher with a speech difficulty sets out to get some difficult students to study with a running theme of equal opportunity, be it a speech difficulty or a financial one. 
The insight that many things that we learn at school level in Math and Science do actually happen in the world around us, we just don’t know the formula.  
That a character introspects to find out that they were masking fear of losing with defiance and rebel.   

Sachin’s wig!   
Way too many group hugs. Made the second half very repetitive   
Naina’s shock when she goes into the slum. She couldn’t have been so out of touch with reality that she looked like she was on a poverty tourist, right?   
Such a nice movie!!I don't think that the movie really advocates about using new teaching methods.  The protagonist has been shown using such methods only to draw the attention of her uninterested bunch of students.A movie which fills you with joyous feelings is worth watching.
