Been there, seen that. As predictable as the next underdog film. Good performances though.It is safe to say that it is not fair to expect anything new from a film in this genre. Not just the 'what', even the 'how' follows a standard pattern to keep you interested. Starts with protagonist at a low; he/she achieves some success, faces a few hardships; successes and failures might alternate a few more times before the ultimate victory. Even so, the films are almost always watchable at least once. Either because of the heartwarming story or because of the specifics of the ups and downs or because of the performances.The performances here seem to be on the mark with R. Madhavan as Madhi's coach. In the trailer itself, Ritika Singh shows the fire within Madhi. Yet, I hope there is something beyond the performances that Saala Khadoos can give us. No, not the romance, in fact let's hope that the romance doesn't get in the way of the story. But, something more to cheer for the khadoos. Music Reviews:

  There are guesses to make as far as a Hindi underdog film's climax goes. The problem with Saala Khadoos is that every minute in the film is predictable. There are some good performances, sure. Also, it invokes a sadness for the condition of sports in the country. That is predictable too. The system is the worst imaginable film after film with little glimmer of hope. Now, that is one sorry state of the state.I guess, even sorrier is that is the fact that reality must be worse than what many of these films portray. Ah well...Despite the predictability, some fine performances keep you engaged. R Madhavan might seem like a sulking loser. But, there are moments when you can see his resolve to be focused on the future of the sport in the country and nothing else. Viewers can take “he is stern for a good reason” personality as a given – that's how good the performance is. Ritika Singh too plays out various shades of Madhi quite well, maybe over-doing the boisterous bit a tad. Yet, not enough to hold it against her. Zakir Hussain does is annoying bit well enough for you to want to squirm every time he is on screen. And this is all despite the off dubbing. That the actors cannot do more is to be blamed on superficially written characters. The script too is convenient when hardships suddenly smoothen out and smooth tiding suddenly become tough. Which is alright, because that is how life is. But here, it is rather unbelievable. The romantic arc, the change in heart come across as functional rather than organic to the story. The fire in the dialogue and spunk of the first half dies out in the second half and you are left with nothing but a predictable plot and performances you have gotten used to. The writers wanted to focus on the sport and nothing else, and that shows. Other departments pitch in to that effect too. The cinematography is not unique but works well during the boxing matches. The songs, though mostly in the background, jar the flow of the film. Some lyrics stick though, like - Khwaab banke aaya tha tu, Yaad banke reh gaya1.The drama though limited, is very typical to that of any film which wants a grand finale. This unfortunately, makes the film even more predictable than it already is. Unfortunately, that is how the ball roles. Underdog films about the state of sports have to focus as much on being unpredictable as they have to on the topic itself. Else, they are bound to lose. ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~1translation – you came as a dream, and turned into a memory. Can be interpreted as – you came as a dream come true and turned into a mere memory)

        ...A touch like that is worth five pages of dialogue. Even the most minor characters give us a glimpse of a larger story. I’m thinking about the boxing committee member played by Radharavi, who’s there for all of five minutes. But we see him with Prabhu, and we sense their shared history, the true nature of which is revealed at the end. That something this deep, this dramatic is accomplished through a laugh-out-loud line (one of many) is the sweetest punch of all....

        ...Another biggest plus in the movie is the music by Santhosh Narayan. The songs were offbeat and the BGM was awesome. He is indeed a talent. Cinematography was neat and editing was crisp and gripping. Overall, Irudhi Sutru is a perfect comeback for Maddy and a film to watch for sure for it's brilliant performances and a neat story of a boxer and his student.

Some of the confrontations between coach and pupil seem unnecessary. The tendency to veer off away from the objective of rags-to-riches glory also takes away from the overall excitement in this enterprise.

But then again, the film keeps you engaged till the proud-India bout in the climax because of the convincing performances. Madhavan is good as the cynical coach who wants nothing more than to earn his stripes. Ritika is raw yet manages a knockout performance. Nasser, Mumtaz and Zakir lend good support.

        ...So yes, it needed to tone down its pitch in places and stay more focused, but there is so much to recommend Saala Khadoos. The fact that it is a sports film is reason enough to pop open the champagne since the genre is too rarely visited in Hindi cinema. As with most such films, the final outcome in the ring is not hard to predict here. The journey to that moment though is emotionally engaging and, after a point, nerve-wracking enough to draw cheers of delight. Adi and Madhi are worth investing in. That’s what makes this film worth watching.

It has the right balance of humour, drama and insight. It sheds light on the many fallacies of sports in India but it never gets preachy or boring. It always stays relevant and most importantly it engages you and entertains. This is Bollywood's happier answer to Million Dollar Baby.
