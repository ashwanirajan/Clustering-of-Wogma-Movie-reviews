wogma rating: Watch if you have nothing better to do (?)
Back to the 90s! Can that mean anything good at all?Do we really need another Maine Pyaar Kiya? To add insult to injury, Ramaiya Vastavaiya has worse actors and cornier lines. It is sad that after a row of good romantic films, this one holds little or no promise.If that is not enough Ramaiya Vastavaiya has Girish Taurani and Sonu Sood do a Shah Rukh-Amrish Puri act from Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. Everything about Ramaiya Vastavaiya seems to say mediocre from the trailers. Even the item number brings more creeps than the usual item number. Prabhu Deva doing pelvic thrust doesn't help one bit. I'd be happy even if a couple of things aren't cheesy/predictable. Music Reviews:
Bollywood Hungama - "3.5/5"    
glamsham - "3.5/5"  
IBN Live, IANS - "2.5/5" 
Milliblog - "Much like Prabhu Deva’s films, Sachin Jigar’s music in Ramaiya Vastavaiya treads the safe and predictable." 
Mumbai Mirror - "1.5/5" 
    - meeta, a part of the audience
  A father and his business partner egg the daughter to get a rich relative's son attracted to her. It sounds sleazier when they say it in Hindi. A mother of today's day and age, who has lived in Australia for years together doesn't once consider asking her son if he likes the girl she has chosen for him before giving her word to the girl's family. Even if such people exist in real life, what makes them interesting? Why would I want to watch them? I didn't like it back in the 90s, I can't stand it now.Even so, Ramaiya Vastavaiya does manage to bring a few smile, or laughs even, with Girish Kumar and his buffoonery. He brings about a childlike cuteness in his character, Ram. The kind of cutesy behaviour that is pretty annoying when an adult does it, but Girish Kumar carries it off quite a few times. And of course, there are other times when it doesn't work at all.Unfortunately, those other times pretty much make for the entire film. Ramaiya Vastavaiya is almost continuously trying really hard to be funny. It goes over the top, loud and unbearable at most times. There are a few instances with the lead pairs sidekick's becoming butt of jokes. Or another character whose always on the phone and his side of the conversation is a funny remark on another parallel dialogue in the scene. All of this too though, works for a while and then it gets repetitive and thus stops being funny.Given that the situation of all villains being against the hero's love for his lady, by itself is nothing very exciting, it is marginally interesting that Ramaiya Vastavaiya has more than one villain, all with supposedly powerful personalities. So, you feel the hero getting cornered from all sides. But, what's the point if the most intimidating one backs off, just like that. Not even a courtesy couple of lines are lectured on to them to transform their take. The problem with love stories like Ramaiya Vastavaiya is that they fail to convince you of the undying love that the lead pair feels for each other. It is more like you are asked to believe they are so much in love rather than you feeling it. So, who are you going to root for? Certainly not for the woman who can't watch out for herself even when her life is at stake. Shruti Haasan as damsel-in-distress works only as much as any stereotypical damsel-in-distress would work.It's disheartening to see a film that mimics films made in the 90s. Especially, when you feel the ones in the 90s shouldn't have been made in the first place!

          Just saw "Ramaiya Vastavaiya", it's actually not too bad! Funny, somewhat sweet, fairly decent.. but I didn't think much of the two leads.

: Worth wathching if u like romantic movies
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.I have seen 3 version of this movie,,hindi,,south indian and bengali,,,,really cant 'bardast' another oneOops sounds like another traditional business based love story but going to watch it tomorrow for sure. Let see how movie goes on. Fingers crossed. :)I feel bad that you have to actually watch these movies Meetu. Too bad you can't skip em like I do!@Anup wow...you endured a lot! Were any of the versions any good?@Sonu no crossing fingers help this one.@kunal Sympathies accepted. :)meetu - yes the south indian version - its called Nuvvostanante Nenoddantana,,,,u should watch this one starring shidhart and trishaNuvvostanante Nenoddantana - this one was the debut of prabhudeva as director,,,,and so far according to me his bst moviei had watched d movie.liked it but found it a lot similiar with another movie.it seems to be the remake of Maine Pyaar Kiya..Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
