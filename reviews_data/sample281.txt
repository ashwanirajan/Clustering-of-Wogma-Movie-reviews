The much promised eccentricity doesn't live throughout and you slowly lose interest in characters in this character-centric film. Yet worth a watch for the performances even if some are caricatures.How delightfully, exciting is Findin Fanny's trailer! It's quirky, it's funny, it seems to be building up to a philosophical purpose and not just from a plot point of view. The search for Fanny seems to be more interesting because it feels like it is to go beyond what seems obvious and will lead to something metaphorical.That said, there is a huge flavor of Matru Ki Bijli Ka Mandola to it. And that one turned out a little disappointing with the quirks going haywire.The said trailer also has a couple of avoidable moments of supposed comedy. That's not too encouraging. Then, you are reminded thatFinding Fanny is by the director of Cocktail which had its own bag of worms. Fortunately, Homi Adajania also directed Being Cyrus which gained brownie points just for being so different. It does come across though, thatFinding Fanny is the film about finding love that the director wanted to make with Cocktail. Anyhow, given this bunch of actors, we don't really need any other reason to look forward to the film. If we end up being disappointed it is going to be for want of proper story or execution and not for lack of talent. After a long while though, my hopes are really up for a film. Music Reviews:

  A film that starts with a voiceover, however lovely the voice and what it has to say, feels likes a cop out. Save for a couple of times, I have felt that the voiceover is just an escape from having to show us the characters, instead you are just told about them. Almost, as if you were reading out the character wikipedia entry. Finding Fanny warms up after this initial put-off, only to set into a routine very soon. From then on it is flat, if not a ride on a downward slope.When the ride starts and the film gets into second gear I loved how enterprising Angie (Deepika Padukone)  is in getting the other characters join the road-trip to find Freddie's (Naseeruddin Shah) love Fanny. She has each one of them believe it was their decision to make them do what she wants them to do. The means and the end are equally quirky. But, then that is the peak of the eccentricity. After this point the craziness is either too forced (a la a caricatured Vladimir) or too flat. This is a shame because individually the characters are uniquely funny. The humor is dark and it plays out quite well. Yes, of course, each one of the characters is a caricature, some more so than the others, yet they are entertaining and engaging. Savio (Arjun Kapoor) the most normal of them all, is also the flattest character - maybe because he is normal. His outburst though comes out of nowhere. But in this crazy bunch, he brings a bit of a balance along with Angie. Angie is sweet, composed and a romantic. At the same time she is creative and gives a whiff that if she has made up her mind, she can get what she wants. This is why, her character's arch seems to be a little too out there. Given that she has the confidence of getting away with anything, it is a mystery why she waited so long for what was playing on her mind. Her strong-headed mother-in-law, Rosie (Dimple Kapadia) on the other hand is the coconut of the group - hard on the outside hiding a soft inner self, but feeling empty deep within. Now see, herein lies the biggest flaw of the film. This thing that Rosie is empty deep within, is not something that I deduced because of what went on in the film, it is because another character spells it out. Again, out of nowhere. That character being Pedro (Pankaj Kapoor). Easily the quirkiest of them all, Pedro is shallow and openly so. His pervert eye is omnipresent in the film and uncomfortable, even though deep down you know he won't be causing too much harm. It is a bit of a shocker when he makes an insightful observation of another character then. I'm not saying people who are overtly shallow are incapable of making deeper inferences. It's just that when the remark comes, not only is it over-dramatic which makes it out of place in this otherwise non-dramatic film, but it also comes out of nowhere. Do you see, the trend here. The way the characters behave towards the end are very uncharacteristic of the way they have been defined for us till then. It almost made me feel like the end was written before everything else and everything else that came before was a means to that end. For a film that seemed to be about enjoying the journey this is too much of a mismatch. I am all for characters behaving out of character, but I feel left-out and thus uninterested if I am not in on what brought about the deviation?The only consistent character then is that of Freddie whose quest is at the center of the film. His quest for finding his love. The beauty of his search is that it's not with the intention of wanting reciprocation. He just wants his feelings known. Unfortunately, the way the quest ends is such a bummer then. Yes, Finding Fanny is more about these characters than it is about the story itself. Which is why each of these characters needed a little more to them than just an initial character sketch. A little more detail, a little more backstory. Thankfully, the characters had brilliant actors to play them out. I doubt there is any other word that would describe him other than "sulky" - which might be the one-word brief he got from the director; which is what he portrays very well and consistently by sulking. Deepika Padukone plays Angie the reason for Savio's sulk. She is very aware of her affect on him and uses it too. There was this glimpse of what a wonderful actor she can be in Love Aaj Kal. Finding Fanny allows her to show us that through the film and she makes the most of it. She uses her eyes to convey it all.A complain that is held against the character, Rosie, but can never be held against the actor that plays her Dimple Kapadia. As gorgeous as ever, padded hips notwithstanding, the lady stumps me every time I see her on screen with how well she makes me forget the actor that's playing it. And I could and would use the exact same words to describe Naseeruddin Shah's portrayal of Freddie. The only one who stuck out for me as an over-done is Pankaj Kapoor. I am sure that was on the director's command. But, he sticks out like a sore thumb with the exaggerated portrayal of his character's craziness. Sure, he's done it well, but wouldn't the challenge have been a better one to underplay that zany character to fit in with the rest of the film?A word on the Goan atmosphere and language before I close - it really worked for me. So did the background music, even if it were too loud at times. It would indeed have been nice to experiment with a few scenes, especially the romantic ones, without any music. Another film, maybe. Once again something that sticks out as forced. Which can be said about the film's summary that Angie spells out for us in the end. Such a clean-cut, sliced and diced ending is not what a dark humored film like this one deserves. Even so, it is nice to have a change of pace and scenery from the typical Hindi film. Always welcome.

It ent­er­tained while it lasted but hasn’t stayed on with me for long.

        ...Playing an irresistible dame who will say sorry before slaying, Deepika takes off the fineries of Bollywood and you can sense the freedom from baggage in her performance. Arjun shows restraint with his scowls and for once sounds genuine in his anguish. Kapur doesn’t allow the flamboyant Don Podro to go over the top but it is Dimple who lends scars to this otherwise pretty-faced film as the lady whose fragile ego and frantic disposition often lead to funny results. Things get untangled rather easily towards the end making one feel that Homi hasn’t paid heed to don Podro’s advice – ‘In art there is no compromise.’ Still there are many reasons to get lost!...

        ...Fanny” is used by Indian English speakers as slang for the bottom. In some places though, it mean a woman’s genitals. Adajania’s overt reason for using the word in the title is the search for Ferdie’s lady love. However, he seems to be having a chuckle with this naming game, playing simultaneously on Angie’s and possibly Freddie’s virginity, Rosie’s expansive buttocks and Pedro’s paintings of grotesquely voluptuous women reminiscent of the legendary Goan painter Francis Newton Souza’s canvases and to a lesser extent, Goan cartoonist Mario Miranda’s buxom ladies. Errr… So who exactly is “finding fanny” in this story? Now if only the film was as substantial as Rosie’s derriere or had as much depth as the connotations of its name...

        ...Slowly, we realize that Fanny is less a character than a metaphor, and that the trip is really an excuse to shake these people out of the inertia they’ve settled into. Maybe I should have taken the trip, given the inertia that settled over me after a while. None of the actors really convinced me that this was a journey worth taking. The senior performers are fine, if a tad too pleased with their craft, but younger actors like Arjun Kapoor and Anand Tiwari are underwhelming – there’s not a note of newness in anything they do. As for Deepika Padukone, she’s become a relaxed presence on screen – but she’s also become so luminous that she blots out everything around her. She may have gotten to the point, like Elizabeth Taylor in the 1960s, where she cannot play ordinary people anymore. The fact that we’re supposed to accept her as a lonely, sexless widow may be the film’s best joke....

Just don’t labour under the illusion that you’ve watched a good film. Adajania has proved with Finding Fanny that rather than being cool and offbeat, he’s actually just a chip off the old Bollywood block....

This is a facetious attempt at quirky satire, much like Vishal Bharadwaj’s ‘Matru ki Bijli ka mandola’ – the characters are interesting and at times even entertaining for a bit, but they don’t add up to anything substantial or worthwhile. There’s no ‘take home’ from this!...

Waiting for Finding Fanny!!! Deepika looks hotter than ever and the remaining cast is also awesome!!!Awaiting your review before deciding whether to watch it on big screen or wait for it to come on TV.Such non-mainline films look appealing in promo by the fact that they are a little "hatke" films (and so feels nice to see something different) and also by the fact that promos are designed to highlight the best whilst hiding the rest.Yet another pseudo intellectual piece of garbage destined to flop at the box office (rightfully so).Anuj; it's made for the elite group who always remain in self denial oblivious to the flavor of large section of the society. It will not cater not a single entertainment value; still these pseudo intellectuals will root for and eulogize its absurdity and simplicity. @Meetu.... Why didn't u reviewed Creature 3D, I was waiting for ur verdict.Good movie considering this year hasn't been too good for bollywood movies and it's been more than 5 months and we don't have anything to better Queen@Guddu: I do not mind films targetting the urban multiplex audiences alone but then they too got to have entertainment coupled with good content in equal measure. Stuff like Delhi Belly & A Wednesday have the ideal mixture of entertainment & content to keep the viewers gripped despite catering to a limited audience. Finding Fanny,Matru Ki Bijli & in all probability the upcoming Haider (hope its more of a Kaminey and less of a Matru Ki bijli) are neither entertaining nor engaging and neither do they have content. They're just wannabe intelligent films made by wannabe film makers desperate for some critical acclaim and awards.@Anuj: Masala movies with over the top dialogues and exaggerated action sequences are not the only means to entertain. Some of us are entertained by movies that portray slices of real life with no added masala. Why can't you come to terms with the fact that other people might have their own definitions of 'entertainment'?@PB : Absolutely correct. So called entertainers don't entertain me at all. Watching movies like No entry or Golmaal, I always wonder if that is supposed to be funny. Rather than being funny, sequences in these type of movies actually irritate/frustrate me.@Anuj : If not really good, Haider will still be watchable compared to Masala crap. Vishal will bring out the best of Shahid Kapoor again. Btw, what's your take on Maqbool, Omkara, Chhal, Haasil. Chhal was a very good movie for that time.@Anuj: Vishal Bhardwaj is a wannabe film maker? Really? Then who is the real film maker? Kindly enlighten us.@Fan so did you watch it?@guddu Had another engagement, couldn't watch and review two films, so chose this one. :D@PB and @Kapil :D and agree. :D@PB: I did not see any ott dialogues in A Wednesday,Kahaani,Special 26 or Delhi Belly. Yet these movies entertained and kept me hooked too. As for Finding Fanny, I hope you're speaking for yourself alone 'coz this movie has been rejected completely in even the multiplexes of metropolitans. Reminds me of films like Guzaarish and 1947 Earth where makers cast popular actors and yet make a mockery of a film all thanks to their self obsession. @Kapil: VB started off brilliantly with Maqbool and Omkara but of late has been making absolute garbage in the form of 7 Khoon Maaf and Matru Ki bijli. He's got one of the worst track records for a commercial director with 7 of his 8 films bombing at the box office. The prospects of Haider too are not too bright considering that they're taking on Bang Bang. Self obsession has taken the better of this film-maker. Calling the masses ignorant fools without taste is a good way of hiding their own incompetency for people like Vishal Bharadwaj and Naseeruddin Shah (who himself confessed that he's a wannabe superstar and a failed commercial actor, his laughable rants against Amitabh Bachchan not withstanding).Finding Fanny crashes on Monday, a huge disaster and a completely rejected film. http://boxofficeindia.com/Details/art_detail/findingfannycrashesonmonday#.VBgr4fmSw7UAn abrupt end to Arjun and Deepika's successful run. A far superior Mary Kom is still going strong in its 2nd week.Golmaal (2006),Bol Bachchan and the Singham films are few of the most entertaining movies I've watched in recent times. And if I really wanna watch something based on content, I'd rather watch a Neeraj Pandey film or an Ashutosh Gowarikar film than the repetitive and sleep inducing self indulgence of film-makers like Vishal Bharadwaj and Anurag Kashyap. The only one who can successfully combine entertainment with content is Raju Hirani and that's what puts him in a league of his own.@Meetu: did not watch. Trusted your review "even the keen wait for DVD".  :-)A thumbs up to Singham Returns/Mary Kom and a thumbs down to Finding Fanny. Perhaps the reviewers' taste is changing for the better. Or perhaps reviewers' across the board have finally acknowledged the fact that wholesome mass entertainers will always provide superior products as compared to the so-called intelligent films made for 1% of the movie watching population. Of course certain individuals like Raja Sen & Mihir Fadnavis can never be expected to change since they play the role of "Trolls" in the film world.Its criminal to speak of Guzaarish and Earth in the same breath. Former is a snore fest while the latter is a classic.@Anuj I haven't seen any of the movies you have mentioned but don't you think your so called '1%' has the choice to like the movies they want and btw how does box office collections tell about a movie's quality considering we live in a country where humshakals made more than Queen?????@Gokul : Firstly, Humshakals made lesser than Queen. Secondly, this is where box office "trending" needs to be looked at. Queen was a film with no star value, made on a minimal cost, having a small scale release and a very below average initial. Yet so positive was the word of mouth that the movie ran to packed houses for 6 weeks in premium multiplexes of metropolitan cities and thereby was a huge hit, both in terms of target audience acceptance as well as in terms of Return on Investment. Humshakals was a much more expensive commercial venture in a commercial genre targetting the urban and mass audiences alike with a huge release size of about 3000 screens. The movie did decently in the first 3 days but such was the negativity and so poor was the word of mouth that it crashed miserably to end up being declared an outright disaster in terms of acceptane as well as ROI. I never mention collections alone. If you read my comments carefully, I always focus more on box office trending based on target audience for a film. And that is the reason why I called 'A Wednesday' is huge success despite it doing just 11-12 cr business, reason being that it had a small scale release, extremely positive word of mouth amongst its limited target audience and a highly profitable commercial venture. Films like Gangs of Wasseypur,Dedh Ishqiya and now FF are neither carrying god word of mouth among their target audience and nor are they commercially viable, considering that they are overpriced films with their high headed film makers being unable to get over their self obsessive film making. Fyi, Bhaag Milkha,Special 26 and Madras Cafe are my favorite films of 2013 and none of them are huge grossers per say. They're small scale films with unanimously positive word of mouth among their target audience and hence good trending and successful films, something that Finding Fanny has failed to accomplish. Queen and Mary Kom too make it to my list of favorite films of 2014 thus far along with Singham Returns. Of course I did hugely enjoy the Dabangg's,Dhoom films and Agneepath's for the entertainment that they offered as well.@JJ: Guzaarish and Earth might be chalk and cheese in terms of content, style and screenplay but my point is that they're both products of self obsessed film makers catering to just their own sensibilities that too after casting 2 of the biggest superstars in the industry.Saw it... did not maintain momentum or reach any significant heights at any point... but a decent watch still with a mildly amusing feel that is maintained throughout... and for the crusaders of "entertainment", even this sub par film was far more entertaining than any of the 100 crore snoozfests although you will never believe it... I can't even imagine how can some people consistently wage war on public forums to bat for third rate film like Singham... and what on earth is this box office quoting game?... Many corrupt and incompetent leaders win elections... since when does momentary popularity indicate quality? Also, not to mention that some of these box office numbers are also doubtful... different sites quite different numbers and there is no genuine authority in this country for film earnings.  I saw Vinod Mirani calling Singham 2 a flop... take that box office fanatics...Yeah, quality is decided by a handful of armchair activists and pseudo intellectual idiots whose only real skill in life in to write a few good sentences in English and watch a few of the so-called artistic nonsense from the world over. Dabangg and Singham will go down in history as few of the most popular and biggest blockbusters of this era. The advocates of the so-called intelligent and quality cinema can keep sulking 'coz a fart and a middle finger salute is all they're worth. I just saw one moron called Vinod Mirani give Singham returns a flop (the same guy who called 3 Idiots as just as "ordinary hit") but i'm yet to come across a single analyst call GOW,Omkara,Maqbool,Earth,Finding Fanny etc as even "Below Average", forget Hit. The verdicts only range from "flops" to "disaster" to "whitewash" just like these armchair critics and their handful of pungent smelling cronies.Here's some factual information for the ignorant : Singham 2 is a certified HIT by each and every box office source except one troll which hires folk like Raja Sen and Vinod Mirani based on their belief that "any publicity is good publicity". Its the 2nd biggest hit of 2014 thus far after the monster called "Kick". As for Finding Fanny, even a Sunny Leone starrer is more watchable than this pile of garbage which unfortunately has brought an abrupt halt to Deepika and Arjun's golden run.Corrupt politicians win elections 'coz the "voting public' does not really have a choice. Fortunately when it comes to watching films, its a "paying public" and not a "voting public" who call the shots. And the "paying public" indeed has multiple choices at hand and thankfully they make the right one's more often than not.@Anuj You are again putting up box office numbers to say a movie is better but not realizing that qualitywise this is the best movie Arjun Kapoor has done and Deepika's best since Karthik calling Karthik and Gow,D-day and Finding Fanny are any day more watchable than a Son of sardar and khiladi 786Yet again the guy is repeating the same crap about box office. The broad generalization you display in every comment just shows your complete lack of understanding in general...who do you think are the "masses" and who do you thing are the "pseudos"?... take the children of one of your massy guy, expose them to less embarrassing and asinine films and good literature and see how they spit on your choices after a few years...@Gokul, @Jitadity:  GOW????  Seriously???honestly guys, it is one of the very very rare films that I did not sit through entirely - I quit it midway.  Pile of rubbish crap- that pseudo intellectuals promote because it is an Anurag Kashyap product.  Makes one feel important, liberal, intellectual, etc. in social circles where you praise an Anurag product and make some serious facial expressions as to the rural politics of India.Films are made with one single purpose - no three actually - entertainment, entertainment, and entertainment.  If you want to see a slice of real life then don't waste 500 Rs to go and sit in an airconditioned hall with plush seats sipping your colas and munching your corn.  Slice of real life could be experienced freely by being out on the streets.  And films dishing out slice of real life (and nothing but that) do not get automatically qualified as quality cintema.@Fan You may not like Gow,but if you think son of sardar is better than that then I can't continue this discussion with you and 'entertainment' doesn't mean logic out of the window and throw insane films and expecting the superstar fans to accept it.Films like kahani,table no.21 or shaitan were not slice of life but were WAY more entertaining than a Singham returns or that stupid akshay kumar film 'ENTERTAINMENT'.@Jit : I myself have passed out of a posh urban co-ed school from urban Delhi and have graduated in information technology from a posh urban middle class college in Bangalore and am employed with one of the top MNC's in the world, and yes I spit on your fake intellectual piles of trash that a handful of worthless critics and their cronies keep propagating day in and day out. Take any 5 start multiplex in Delhi,Bombay and Bangalore and you'd find a lot more of the urban educated individuals turning up to watch a Dabangg,Singham,Ghajini or AGneepath than some worthless trash like Dedh Ishqiya, Matru Ki Bijli and Finding Fanny. And these are urban,educated and sophisticated individuals i'm speaking of, the only difference being that they ain't a bunch of pretentious intellectual idiots. Movies are made to entertain and entertain alone and that is precisely the reason why the likes of Wanted,Dabangg,Singham,Agneepath,Ghajini and DHoom 3 ran amok and shattered records, not only in single screens and B/C centers but even in the multiplexes of metropolitan cities. As for Finding Fanny, this pile of garbage is finding it hard to get an audience even in the PVR's and INOX's of the world. As I always maintain, be it urban India or the masses, the audiences are smart enough to make the right choices. And that is the precise reason why brilliant films like Kahaani and Queen run to packed houses among their "target audience" and so do the Dabangg's and Singham's of the world. The only difference being that a Dabangg and Singham has a lot wider target audience catering to A/B & C class centers while a Kahaani/Queen/Mary Kom cater only to A centers alone. Hence the difference in collections.@Gokul : Khiladi 786 and Entertainment have been rejected by the masses and have rightly bombed at the box office. Just like GOW was rejected by the urban multiplex audience and bombed at the box office too. Box office numbers and trending is the ONE and ONLY way of judging how well a film has been accepted by its target audience. The reason why QUEEN is a popular film is not because some worthless critics gave it a thumbs up, its because it was loved by its target audience (the urban multiplex audiences) and ran to packed houses for 6-7 weeks in the major metros. Ditto for Kahaani. The reason why DABANG/GHAJINI/SINGHAM/AGNEEPATH/Chennai Express etc are blockbusters are because they ran to packed houses for weeks together among their respective target audience (Multiplexes and single screens in these cases). Unfortunately the same cannot be said about the likes of GOW/Finding Fanny/Entertainment etc. Ultimately the so-called "critical acclaim" has no impact on 99% of the audiences except for some self obsessed individuals living in their own la la land with their own definition of quality which is far away from ground reality. OH MY GOD was a typical example of a film being given mediocre ratings by the worthless critics and yet running for weeks together across multiplexes throughout the nation despite the negative ratings. Just goes on to prove my point further. And if you really think that Table No21 and Shaitan are brilliant films, I rest my case.MARY KOM is holding well in week 2 and is on its way to some box office glory, although not to the same extent as Queen and Kahaani. Once again proves my point, a well made film will find an audience, come what may. If a film does not find an audience, its simply not a well made film (GOW,Finding Fanny,Dedh Ishqiya,Matru Ki Bijli).I watched it on my laptop and it was not that bad a movie.@Anuj I think you right on few points but you  are still making a point about few good commercial films but you also ignoring a fact that movies like Bodyguard,Ye jawani hai deewani sorry @Meetu but i did not like it at all etc earn so much despite not even an average flick which creates confusion that which movie is good or bad.Like a Dhoom3 is one of the biggest hits but do you really think it was that good and this were i think box office figures are misleading even by your standard it must be a good trending movie to earn that much amount.I think what ever i can understand by your point of you reading so many of your comments is that the economics of the movie should be decent so that it earns that much amount which can keep all the parties afloat.Well i liked GOW 1 and shaitan as well as Singham and Dabangg and i think every one India atleast have a opinion.@Anuj You are again showing box office economics which say nothing about a films' quality.And if you think Singham and Dabang are better films than Table No.21 and Shaitan then there's nothing I can say to youToo close to 30 crores , considering that it has been released in 900 screens only , these figures are very good.......Even producers are happy with how the movie is working......Overseas collections are satisfactory too....Could have done a lot better if release alone , since Creature 3d has affected its collection, but still FF grossed more then crearure 3d , despite of the fact that creature 3d has been released in more than 1200sc ....  Although i havnt seen it yet , but m only hearing good things about the movie....@Siddharth @Gokul : So who decides quality? You,me or the critics? None of us! Because factually the term "quality" is and will always be subjective according to one's own taste and expectation. And yes I did immensely enjoy Dhoom3 and Krrish3 and do consider Dabangg & Singham to be a modern day classics. And so do a many more among the audience seeing the sort of collections these films have had, their TRP's,their DVD sales and their box office trending. In fact Singham-1 is the most popular and watched bollywood film on Indian television since Sholay and Andaaz Apna Apna. "Quality" might be subjective but "popularity" is definitely not. Popularity is directly proportional to the number of people watching and patronizing a film and that is what makes Dabangg,Singham and Dhoom so immensely popular and memorable. As for the term QUALITY, its is not the monopoly of a handful of armchair critics and their pseudo intellectual cronies. Every individual right from a tea seller to a business executive has his or her own definition of quality and trashing one or the other either way is outright disrespectful if not shameless, something that a lot of critics and journalists from the world over have mastered. PS: The number of people who'd prefer watching Dabangg over GOW would be in a 10:1 ratio and that's something I can bet a hell lot of money on. Not that I have anything against folk loving GOW or Omkara but I certainly have issues with the handful giving their own subjective definitions of "Quality" and claiming them to be universal facts, a crime that many of our so-called critics (many of them failed & wannabe film-makers themselves) commit week after week.@Anup : Nice try at a desperate attempt to defend a complete box office disaster. The films has released in over 1500 screens (same as Special 26) and has been produced on approx cost of 40-45 cr. Almost all the distributors and exhibitors have lost out hugely on the film. The producers would obviously not lose out much since these days theatrical rights of a film are sold even before its release and producers are always in the green, come what may! Even the producers of Kites and Mangal Pandey made huge profits but we all know the fate of that film's distributors.@Anuj I too don't have a problem with the biggies.I liked the first Singham and liked Kick until they decided to shove down that 'message'.It's just that I feel films like Finding Fanny should be appreciated for not following the herd and trying to do something new because very few filmakers try to do that.It's been nearly 10 months this year and we have only 2-3 films which has something new to offerFor further comments (and arguments) please read the following article before accusing me of being a fan of "nonsense cinema" or a "masala junkie".We saw it tonight because it popped up on Netflix, and really ended up liking it a lot, Meeta. It's a little movie, quirky as all get-out which would normally be as irritating as Savio's sulks - but it worked as a ironic, a bit dark-humored, comedy with a heart. Deepika Padukone impressed me right out the gate with her dual role in Om Shanti Om! (which we clearly liked a lot more than you did) - and she just keeps getting better as an actress. She is the motor of this movie, and she works splendidly as it - even if you're right, she does seem like a much more together person than the youthful widow dealing with her comic-book Mother-in-Law. Naseeruddin Shah has often been really great - though after so many Big! Characters, seeing him play a little guy beaten down by life but still with a bit of spirit in him was a welcome change.Is Pankaj Kapoor a caricature? Of course he is - but he's the kind of caricature everybody who's ever dealt with creative people knows. We all laughed watching him, because our US fans of Indian Movies all knew Characters Just Like Him - most of us knew the same people he reminded us of! I don't think we've ever seen Dimple Kapadia or Arjun Kapoor before - but they fit their characters so well you wanted to punch them sometimes. I have say, it was hilarious that Angie slapped Savio after he kissed her - then a few minutes later, let him know it was because he could have built up to it better, and started making out with him after confessing her love life had been, well, lacking....The only thing that bothered us was making a joke out of killing a cat - though they paid it off well enough. Okay, that's a personal thing, given as many cats as Tammy and I have....We saw it tonight because it popped up on Netflix, and really ended up liking it a lot, Meeta.

That's not a SuperHit by any means, but for a modestly-budgeted "art movie" distributed by Fox Star Studios, spoken in English? That's not bad, man....@TimELiebe I am glad you enjoyed the film. I wonder why it feels much better to know you enjoyed a small budget film that I didn't like so much versus a big budget one. I wonder... :PAbout dead cats - oops!@Meeta, I think it's because it's easy for most people, including me, to like Big Splashy Dumb Entertainers. That's why just about every film industry on Earth makes so many of them, because they make a lot of money and travel well to other cultures. That they're the cinematic equivalent of fast food is both their greatest strength and their biggest problem, especially if you've eaten them for so long you're sick of them. That I liked something that plainly isn't a fast food movie, even if it's one you didn't like as much as I did, might mean I'm starting to develop...taste...? ;)I still love Big Dumb Entertainers - but I've seen enough Indian movies by now that I can enjoy both Finding Fanny and the latest entry in the Krrish franchise.@TimELiebe My husband calls them "chewing gum for the brain". Enjoying it becomes mechanical very soon :D@Meeta - "chewing gum for the brain" is also good. :)Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
