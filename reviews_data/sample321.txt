Such a shame. A woman-centric film and all that. Hard to like despite the quirks.Despite a borderline cheesy trailer, Revolver Rani - the name, the supposedly women-centric theme and post-Queen Kangna Ranaut make you believe that this film has potential to be a winner. Interestingly enough the cheesiness in the trailer is actually borderline enjoyable quirkiness; the women-centric theme is 
"supposedly" at the end of it all and Kangna Ranaut does a fantastic job of bringing the zaniness alive. However, the disappointment with how the "woman-centric" bit of the story plays out takes away everything from what is or could be appreciable about the film. Despite the spoofiness and the goofiness of it all, I just couldn't believe that was how it was panning out for her, our Revolver Rani. On the other hand, Kangna Raut makes every bit of the crazy Revolver Rani (aka Alka) as believable as enjoyable. Yes, she's over-the-top but in a good way. Now, that's something I'd say very rarely about an OTT performance. Sure, there are places where she loses it and certainly it is one of those performances where the labor shows. But, I must say after Queen I give the lady extra points for just trying. She does lose her steam in some scenes. But, it is unfair to blame it all on her.The writing itself loses steam and becomes repetitive once too often. The second half tries to bring sense to the plot which is a disservice to the hilarity of it all. It doesn't help that other than Revolver Rani, none of the characters get any attention from the writers. They are all rather plain and painfully predictable. The one thing that is consistent and would have been beautiful if it were paid a little more attention to is the background score. It is so asynchronous to the visuals that it adds a layer to the eccentricity.  Revolver Rani makes you feel it had the potential to be an enjoyable, out-of-the-box film. But, I doubt, with that second half there was any possible redemption.

Vir Das spoofs Shahrukh Khan most of the time which it seems is the requirement of his on- screen phony character and therefore tolerable!...

It’s not the cracker of a film that it could have been. Despite all its pluses, what it ends up being instead, is a damb squib...

The only letdown in the film is Vir Das, who seemed to be struggling hard to (unsuccessfully) fit into the whole scheme of things. The next best thing about this film is its music. Watch it....

Besides Kanagana's character, all the other characters are half-baked and lacked the intensity. 'Revolver Rani' should have been more dark and realistic as its name sounded, sadly it turns out to be just a colourful water pistol, which only looks appealing and works for a short period lacking the hard hitting factor....

          "Revolver Rani" is total bakwaas. Mr. Director 'Gangs of Wasseypur' was made once and can not be copied. Try something better or different.

I found it to be a disappointing and horrible movie. Kangana Ranaut is totally wasted.@TimELiebe I have a feeling you will enjoy this one@Suman performance didn't work for you either?@Mahesh ouchI would like to have a review on Children of war please :)@wogmafan Hey! I couldn't watch the film for various reasons, but Pradeep did and he reviewed it here - http://wogma.com/movie/children-war-review/ Thanks!My thoughts on Revolver Rani...Revolver Rani is essentially a satire on the power hungry politicians, treading through the dark alleys of power in the Chambal Valley, who have little regard for anything save their own ambitions. Revolver Rani comes across as an experimental film and as with all experiments the probability of failure is much higher than the probability of success. Not everyone has the appetite for nonsensical, over-the-top violence which Revolver Rani offers in abundance. A rather overt swashbuckling style of cinema à la Sergio Leone is something the Hindi film audiences are usually not very comfortable with. And that’s precisely where Revolver Rani suffers. Hindi cinema is still in the need of its very own Quentin Tarantino who can help the audiences expand their cinematic horizons. But, until the audiences grow more receptive, films like Revolver Rani would continue to be treated as mere exercises in style. The best way to approach Revolver Rani is an indigenous tongue-in-cheek Western featuring a rugged cowgirl as oppose to a cowboy. Yes, Alka Singh can best be described as the female equivalent of a desi cowboy straight out of some Western pulp novel. The movie’s graphic novel feel only accentuates it further. Besides, the film is rife with symbolism and allegories. The thinking viewer will certainly be able to savor what’s at his/her disposal.  The director Sai Kabir, a self-confessed fan of Johnnie To and Robert Rodriguez, paints a lurid canvass, oozing with an abundance of grotesqueries, adorned by shifty, larger-than-life characters caught in existential traps—all this facilitates the orchestration of rather palatable mise-en-scène. Revolver Rani presents experimental filmmaking at its very best but typically with little commercial relevance, especially in the context of the Indian market. Kangana Ranaut shines in her portrayal of a politically powerful female goon. There’s no denying that Kangana Ranaut performs Alka Singh to a tee. Barring a few anachronisms, everything right from her non-glamorous look to her native accent to her aggression in bed makes Kangana look convincing as Alka Singh—a caricature that strongly harks back to Uma Thurman’s character “The Bride” in Kill Bill movies. Kangana’s tour de force performance is well complimented by the rest of the cast. And the unconventional music adds to the overall mood of the film. There is certainly more to the film than meets the eye. As a socio-political satire, its relevance cannot be overlooked. The undercurrent of dark humour only adds to movie's overall appeal.
