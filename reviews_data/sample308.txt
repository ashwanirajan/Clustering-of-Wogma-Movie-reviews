
wogma rating: Watch if you have nothing better to do (?)
Yet another, "let's fight the system" film. This one takes on way too much and takes way too much time to express itself too. Fugly's trailer makes you as neutral about it as is possible.  The premise is very Shaitan-ish and has enough novelty about it to make it intriguing. At the same time, toilet humor seems to be in-built with one of the main characters owning a commode business. We know where they are hoping to get their smiles from. The drama that ensues though seems interesting. Of course, Jimmy Sheirgill's presence does tip the balance in the film's favor too. The rest though so much potential to quickly slip into a boring fare. The music too doesn't seem to have inspired any good reviews. Let's hope the film betters the music. Music Reviews:
Bollyspice - "2/5" 
Bollywood Hungama - "1.5/5" 
koimoi - "3/5"  
Milliblog - "Flippant, barmy soundtrack befitting the title!"

  Four friends. One girl, three boys. Delhi. Attitude times a few. To top it off, one of them is a cabinet minister's son. They seem to be interested in just having a good time. Given this set-up Fugly actually caught me by surprise when a group of four friends who seemed interested only in having a good time got worked up about social issues - be it eve-teasing or the law and order-politician nexus. It is a shame then, that Fugly doesn't capitalize on the fact that these issues touch the characters' lives personally and ours too. Despite it being so easy to identify with them, we could barely care about what happens to them.The culprit is the paradoxical pace. There is so much going on in the film to the extent that it almost feels like a thriller. Yet, the dramatization, the slow-motions, the extra time spent on elaborating on a scene - kills the film. I am a huge fan of silences and impregnated moments. I love lingering scenes. But, Fugly shows how that can go all wrong when you want to tell the maker, "Got it, move on already!" I guess there is a time, a place and a movie for everything.The four lead characters are played by actors who are either too loud or too flat. Amongst the other actors, of course only Jimmy Sheirgill looks like someone we can take seriously. But, then again, he becomes repetitive and predictable. I doubt any of this can be blamed on the actors when the writing is haywire - in screenplay and dialogue. The story by itself is interesting, but it has these irrelevant sub-plots. Almost like, before coming up with the story the writers came up with a list of the issues they wanted to address - eve-teasing, corruption in law and order, hooliganism and ruthlessness in politics, angst of the youth, insensitivity of the media, prositution, gay prostitution, rave parties and so on. They then came up with a story to fit in everything. And that's no way to tell a story, is it?The song and dance sequences further break the jarred flow. They only make matters worse with run-time already stretched beyond patience levels due to some editing/screenplay decisions. Style can add to content, but not this laboured kind of style.I'd still like to believe that Fugly could've been a different film, even better maybe, if they fixed the pace issue. But then again, maybe that would be a different film altogether.

          #Fugly is a worth...
For the intense Mohit @moh_m Marwah
And a chilling performance by @jimmysheirgill who plays a nasty 'Chautala'

          'Fugly' review: The film is neither thrilling nor
stirring.

          Fugly is too bad. Walked off it half way. It's unbearable.
        No readers have rated this movie yet.This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.That's a pity, Meetu, as this sounds like a potentially good and useful film, an entertaining way to raise social consciousness - like NO ONE KILLED JESSICA or RANG DE BASANTI. I know "eve-teasing" is a topic that gets my wife, Tammy, very up in arms! Yes, women's rights groups in the US and Europe know about it and have been petitioning the Indian Government, our own Government officials who deal with India, and corporations with large Indian interests To Do Something about it….@TimELiebe yeah, as we should all be. No the movie tries to do that, but it didn't strike as anywhere close.::Nods:: Thank you for telling me about that, Meetu.I'm - not sure how Tammy (or some of the other women in our group) might react to a movie's handling of a topic she feels so strongly about….OTOH - we do tend to thoroughly enjoy a lot of movies you don't like at all. :D We all had a blast watching ROWDY RATHORE - maybe because it's exactly the kind of go-for-broke masala that first made us interested in Indian films.@TimELiebe Yeah, I know. Let me know what you think of it, if you end up watching it.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
