
wogma rating: Add to 'must watch' list (?)
A film that uses the disarming charm of actors like Farouque Shaikh, Sarika, Raghuveer Yadav and more. Writing that makes you care about the characters they play. You have settled down in life, your kids are doing well for themselves. You are all set to enjoy life carefree. And boom life hits you. You are asked to come-of-age all over again. Club 60 might come across as a film of one such man, but it also goes on to tell you that he, his troubles and tragedy not that unique after all. Just like when you look around, you see that like you, everyone has problems. They just choose to deal with them differently. There is something very delightful about films that take on topics related to the elderly - not the glamorous Baghbaan way, but more like the Listen Amaya way. Especially, when you have charming actors like Farouque Shaikh and Sarika play the lead roles. Not only do they make the characters believable, but they make you care for them. And even if that should be the norm, we know it is very difficult to come by in Hindi films. Yet again, Sarika does that one scene which completely bowls you over and brings a lump to the throat and more. I now look forward to every film that Farouque Shaikh chooses to do, because the films by themselves are interesting. And as unfair as it may sound, he could sleepwalk through his role as Taariq in Club 60. Raghuveer Yadav plays his Munna bhai with great finesses. While playing a sleazeball must be one of the easiest in an actor's range of talent, playing a sleazeball who convinces you that he is good-naturedly so right from the first scene has to be a rare one. And it doesn't come across as inconsistent at all.And yet these performances are not the best thing about Club 60. A pleasant surprise are Sharat Saxena and Tinu Anand. The characters they play could easily have become caricatures. Yet, that is avoided with finesse and you see them go through their highs and lows with unexpected grace and dignity. So much so that a fine performance by Satish Shah is side-lined. Where Club 60 suffers then - other than the low-budget-induced-production-values - is the writing. It gets a little repetitive, and the film stretches out a good 15-20 minutes too long. The situations created for each of the characters becomes a tad stereotypical. Even so, you cannot help but want to know more about them because you've grown to care for them. They do remind you of your parents and their group of friends. Alas, the climax is a little too dramatized and drastic for the tone the film maintains through the first two hours. For many, the film might be a good enough on TV watch, but I just couldn't help giving it an extra nudge for the heart it takes to make a film like this. One which takes an understanding, even if a slightly patronizing, look at the generation that's over the hill.

        ...Well if you love sweet, feel good, slice of the life type film with good performances then this movie is a must watch for all of you. Apparently, the narration style is bit slow with loud treatment and few unwanted tracks which dilutes the film. But on overall basis it's a refreshing change from the usual crap we have been witnessing in recent times, thus would advise all good movie lovers to enroll themselves quickly to this wonderful club, which is full of sweet and salty moments.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Well well.  Hindi films are slowly getting on the bandwagon I referred to in my post on Last Vegas, i.e. making films with mainly senior only star cast.  I was kind of expecting Hindi film makers to follow Hollywood studio steps and come with senior only subjects and films.Will definatly watch this when on dvd........@Fan I know! Very heartening to watch.@Anup You should. And let us know what you thought.Watch Sarika for her acting, grace and sarees...and of course on of the finest actor  Farookh Sheikh for his restrained performance...absolutely brilliant...don't forget to carry your kerchief with you , you may need it to wipe eyes many times if you have a golden heart.Its a movie to watch out this season.A light hearted movie with a sensible message. A must watch..Farooque Sheikh and Sarika are the reason to watch this film. When they are off screen, the descent into the puerile is so palpable that you might be watching a Rohit Shetty film (almost). The other 60 plus characters are typical filmy caricatures( yes Meetu, I use the term advisedly)with tragic backgrounds which are a little too pat. The final, by the numbers, lapse into bathos is the last straw.I wanted to like the film, but a so-so is the best that I can manage.And yes, Sarika's monologue is superb. Almost makes the film worth watching.Thank you for sharing your views @Neeraj, @Umesh and @SamirThe moment i read ur review for the 2nd time exactly before watching the movie,,,,,the thing comes to my mind,,,,,,,,what a great actor we have lost .......I cant believe that m never gonna see farroq sheikh again in my life,,,,he is one of the brillient actors of bollywood........I will miss him alot....About the movie,,,,it gives u freshness,,,,make u feel happy from the core of ur heart,,,,u cant escape urself from crying on the climax scene,,,,,....The scene when Dhillan explain to mannu bhai how the girl have stolen all of his stuff in the hotel room was hilarious,,,,and mannu bhai was the best character in the movie.....He teaches u how to live a life despite of all the prblm......Yes there are faults in the technical department,,editing was bad,,,,and the movie looks more like a tv programme sometimes,,,,but that doesnt make the movie bad.......Its a sorrow that more 85% of bollywood audience should have skipped it for watching shit like Rambo Rajkumar.....Loved Sarika's monologue and her beautiful sarees. Developed a new respect for her as an actress. Wish the mainstream shops in India sell these sarees not the usual crap with gold and silver embroidery all over@Anup yeah :(@Vibha :) he he heCopyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
