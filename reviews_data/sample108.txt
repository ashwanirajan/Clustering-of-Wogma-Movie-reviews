Breezy cute romantic film becomes a chaotic mess.It is time for a romcom again. This time Tanu Weds Manu meets Bajrangi Bhaijaan. This could have been interesting if one of the aspects was novel. With both themes - runaway bride and a Indian finding themselves in Pakistan – done a few times, the combination will have to be give something really different - dialogue or individual situations or something. It doesn't help that Jimmy Sheirgill is called upon yet again to be the guy who loses his bride-to-be. There is a third angle here and that might be the one to look forward to most – both because of the actor involved, Abhay Deol and the character himself. That and the couple quips in the trailer are just about enough to draw me to the theater. Will it keep me entertained and/or charmed through the couple hours though? Music Reviews:
Bollywood Hungama - "3/5" 
Filmfare – "3.5/5" 
glamsham - "3/5" 
India Today - "If he keeps giving forgettable work like this, it might not take too much effort for the audience to erase him from their memories." 
Milliblog - "After Housefull 3, Sohail has a couple of good numbers here too!"

  Like the trailer promised, Tanu Weds Manu meets Bajrangi Bhaijaan. We get a bonus! Wake Up Sid. But what didn't expect was it would become a Housefull. However, somewhere along the way, it has a few wonderful laughs that keep it light and breezy.Sure, Happy Bhag Jayegi has all the trappings of a typical romcom, that goes for the “chaotic lie-after-lie” brand of comedy. But some of its one-liners and situations make you giggle at the silliness. Surprisingly, there is some subtle humor too. Also, unexpected is the social commentary on parental pressure in the form of a parallel thread. Bilal Ahmed's (Abhay Deol) track grows on the side almost unnoticed. Only, when the other characters talk about it,do you realise that it is a major part of the film. While each individual element of the story, the romance, the comedy, the politics, the social message are beaten to death in films, this mixture kind of works. The last bit slapped on, in the form of slapstick, ruins it all. It is the things that you don't expect Happy Bhag Jayegi to do that make the film enjoyable. Some of the humor aside, they named a character Afridi and did not take potshots at the Pakistani cricketer! That must have required some restraint. What's more, Bilal's wife (Momal Sheikh) who could have been the stereotypical vamp, is constrained in her reactions and in fact very human. The performances were all convincing and entertaining. The comic timing, the littlest of change in body and facial expressions, were thoroughly enjoyable. It is quite an achievement for Jimmy Sheirgill to play the guy who always loses his bride-to-be, and yet be entertaining all over again.The music is good too. The songs for once don't seem intrusive, even if the background music weirdly guides you to laugh and stop. It is the chaos in end that just gets to you and brings the film crumbling down. It is as if you can see the writer's struggle with what they really want – a situational sense of humor verus what they think the audience wants – a slapstick.

        ...Surprisingly an element of gravity is introduced mid-way when the narrative sneaks in a telling contrast in the relationships that Bilal and Guddu share with their respective life-mates. Director Mudassar Aziz explores the anatomy of commitment and honesty in a relationship without squandering away the spirit of satire that streams across this endearing rom-com. He also makes gentle comments through Piyush Mishra on how much of India and Pakistan is shared experience.

Buckle up and enjoy the ride, Janaab!

What he desperately needed here was either more time and thought, or a co-writer to help him build on the starting blocks he set up. Happy Bhag Jayegi is fun and funny in large parts, but the second half is also bogged down by how insubstantial and consequently forgettable it is.

        ...Happy Bhag Jayegi marks the return of two actors whom we have missed seeing on screen for a long time – Abhay Deol and Diana Penty. Diana Penty has improved a lot from her debut film, Cocktail, though you might see shades of Jab We Met’s Geet in her character. Abhay Deol is fine as the young politician, who would rather be a cricketer. Ali Fazal and Jimmy Sheirgill are also adequate in their roles. However, it’s Piyush Mishra who is the best of the lot, as most of his dialogues hit the bullseye. Let’s hope that the second half keeps up the mirth of the first half.

Happy Bhag Jayegi has a whole lot of laughs in the first half, but I can’t wholeheartedly recommend it solely because of its change in direction which really brings the film down.

Clichéd and contrived situations abound and the narrative begins overreaching into the farfetched and absurd.  Abhay Deol and Jimmy Shergill are the performers here while Diana Penty, Ali Zafar, Momal Sheikh and the rest do a fair job. The real problem with the film though is that the characters and their motivations aren’t believable. So while you can enjoy the brief bursts of situational humour there’s no lasting impression left behind.

        ...It’s pleasing to see Deol back on our screens after a gap of two years, looking fit and relaxed, if a little awkward when he pushes for comedy (he’s a more natural straight man). Penty, who’s had an even longer gap since her 2012 debut in Cocktail, enlivens her somewhat prototypal “force of nature” role with comic energy and a surprising warmth. Sheirgill is fast turning into one of Hindi cinema’s great sad sacks, and Mishra into one of its finest mutterers. Their collective enthusiasm renders the film’s lack of subtlety endearing and its gaps in narrative logic inconsequential. I’m having a hard time remembering the last time I watched a Hindi film this silly but still found myself laughing.

gaanemann:
          Happy bhag jayegi is a refreshing movie. Abhay deol is superb. Jimmy sheirgill is beyond description. Overall, a flawed but watchable film.

          #HappyBhagJayegi seems like a Hrishikesh Mukherjee movie, and that’s a huge compliment for the movie

          This maybe an unpopular opinion, but I quite liked Happy Bhag Jayegi. A little uneven & a little too long, but a fun movie nonetheless.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Comic timings were really good. If 90% of the movie is genuine, small amount of slapstick does not really irritate. It may not be a great movie, but worth watching and worth recommending to others. In this age of over hyped 100-200 crore crappy stuff being dished out, this genuine work was a relief. Time and money worth spent. I didn't know Diana Penty could act so well.  Used to think that she would be like Deepika. But I was pleasantly surprised to watch her performance. She acts better and looks better than Deepika and Katrina. She should become the bigger star than the  latter two. I hope so.@Kapil true about worth recommending for a fun watch over some of the other big budgets ones off late.Also, I found this to be a better and more mature movie when compared to Bajrangi Bhaijaan, which was lapped up by almost all the critics, with the former getting an average rating of only 2.6 compared to the latter's 4.1, as per your statistics. Anyways, except WOGMA, I don't even read any other review site.Thank you, Kapil!A "happy" go lucky film.  As I watch a large proportion of hindi films that are churned out, I did enjoy this one.  Even though it has almost nothing (except the two leading ladies) that I retained after leaving the theatre.  I would imagine that people on a strict limited watching of Hindi films (for taste reasons or for budget reasons) are likely to skip this film.  And my rating of so-so is keeping in mind this population - it is NOT a must watch film.The film is a light hearted comedy of errors - although after a while the errors seem more contrived than natural.  But the mood is "happy", and the visuals are colourful and zany.  So it worked well for me.Performances are alright - every actor fitted the role well.  Although the two leading ladies were marvelous.  I found the Divya Dutta look alike Momal Sheikh very expressive with her eyes.  She had a special touch.  And so did Diana Penty - wonder why she disappeared after delivering a sleeper hit like Cocktail.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
