Same ole stuff. A senseless comedy with no thought put into any department. Only this time its Kukunoor trying to do a Priyadarshan and failing miserably. Now, how sad is that!?...actually it is. It attempts to be a comedy but succeeds at not making you laugh even once. It is a same-same romantic story but is different because it doesn't make you go "aaaaawww" once. It is also different from other Nagesh Kukunoor products. While Hyderabad Blues was just about average and Iqbal was a regular story presented well. Teen Deewarein and Dor(though copies) were certainly worth writing home about. Bombay to Bangkok however is one of those you feel ashamed about...let alone because you made it, you wouldn't want people to know you have watched it. How amateurish is it to have a 25-30 year old song play every time a certain character comes on screen!? So not funny, and such a sad way to romanticize anything. To add to the mayhem, voiceovers are used to avoid actual narration and shabby dream sequences appear to annoy. Making a brainless flick is an art. An art that is not easy to master. Even if you accept sexual references, toilet jokes, stereotyping, etc. as indispensable part of slapstick, you need something extra to keep them together. The movie has to have a driving force. Watching Bombay to Bangkok made me feel as if everyone is just going through the motions, no one is really interested. The cameraman just seemed to pick a few angles and the director played "eeny-meeny-miney-moe" to decide on the final shot. The editor seems to have been chopping stuff in his sleep. Only that can explain why some shots never seem to end and others are way too abrupt. The background music is pretty random too. Waltz replaced by some jingle-like tune for no rhyme or reason. Like everything else the script too is not completely thought out either. After an east meets far-east basic concept, the rest seems to be just written sporadically - while thinking of a thousand other things. The screenplay like its character is just running from one situation to another without any connection in between. An aimless, listless approach.Having said that, the cast does all it can to rise above all the flaws and does whatever best it can, given the constraints of a mediocre team. What bothers me most is that Nagesh Kukunoor, arguably one of the better film-makers in the industry, has shown such a thoughtless attitude to film-making. It is truly disheartening to see him struggle and fail miserably in trying to fit into the mainstream.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Boy (Shreyas Talpade) is trying to save his life from soft-hearted gangster. In that attempt, he meets girl (Lena Christensen) and but, obviously falls in love with her. A silly turn of heart by the gangster and another silly misunderstanding and reconciliation later, we finally arrive to the end of the movie!Boy (Shreyas Talpade) is trying to save his life from soft-hearted gangster. In that attempt, he meets girl (Lena Christensen) and but, obviously falls in love with her. A silly turn of heart by the gangster and another silly misunderstanding and reconciliation later, we finally arrive to the end of the movie!Seriously - nothing!Seriously - nothing!Actually there are way too many to jot down, but here are a few subtles examples -

Inconsistency in the Shreyas Talpade's language - once he uses a refined hindi word like "swayam" and calls himself "hum" and in other scenes he uses absolutely colloquial language like "haila" 
Lena's character, Jasmine is in dire need of money and she is shown working as a volunteer. To add to it, Manmeet Singh (a side character) actually explains "she is a volunteer, she works here during the day and there during the night, needs money."
Again Manmeet Singh says he doesn't know Lena the first time he sees her at the parlor and the next day she is shown working in the medical camp and he says she is a volunteer.
Use of various songs as tributes, while borderline cute, were too abrupt to make any sense. E.g., "bhor aa hi gaya andhiyaara" from bawarchi or aashaayein from Iqbal - actually the latter was not even cute!
The editing of the scene in which Rati and Shreyas Talpade's character Shankar confront each other - really abrupt and shabby.
The sound effects of the action scene towards the climax. Gave the scene an extremely artificial look.
The climax was so long-drawn that it took the movie even lower just when I thought that was not possible.

Beautiful buildup of characters. Each character is a perfect story. I think it one of the better comedies I have seen. Pretty eclectic and international in taste. It showcases Kuknoor s international exposure. Very few people have understood him well. He is a very understated director. I am yet to see a bad movie by him. I have seen this movie 4 times already. Trust me, ignore all negatives and see it for yourselves.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
