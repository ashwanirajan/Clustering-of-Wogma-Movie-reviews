Mere Brother Ki Dulhan is a fun but an unengaging romantic comedy. A lto of the dialogues are enjoyable but the overall story has nothing endearing about it, neither is it a story that keeps me glued to know what happens next. But Katrina Kaif shines and how!Mere Brother Ki Dulhan - The title pretty much gives it away. And what's left is given away by the trailer. 

So, we are promised a quick recap of What's your rashee? with a hint of the story from Sorry Bhai. The hope is that the sum of the parts will be greater than the individual parts. Or at the very least, we can look forward to some fresh fun along the way. 
I didn't think I'd ever say this but I'm actually not feeling so bad about seeing Imran Khan (after Delhi Belly) and Katrina Kaif (after Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara). Both had some awesome comic timing going in their films and that's exactly what they need for what looks like a predictable love-triangular rom-com. 
It's safe to assume that the basic plot will be predictable, right? After all, the banner producing it is Yash Raj Films. The probability of me enjoying one of their products is 50-50, but we can almost always tell how a film coming out of their house is going to end. 
I'm surprised that despite the candy-floss flavor that the trailer carries I'm still neutral about how I might enjoy the film. Maybe because I remember how unenthused I felt after watching Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara's trailer and yet I loved the film. Here's an attempt at hoping that the book will be better than the cover - especially the artwork of the title of the film.

  Rom-coms like Mere Brother Ki Dulhan make you wonder what "love" really is. It doesn't really give you any deep understanding of the concept in general or even in terms of the characters. In fact, the way characters fall in and out of love in Mere Brother Ki Dulhan, it is clear that the film doesn't want us to take it or any of its characters seriously. The basic idea is to have fun, other things, like logic, etc can wait for another film. And so you go with the writer's definition of what love is - spending some good fun time together.

Thankfully, the "fun" part is enjoyable. And it is only because of Katrina Kaif. It's like she just cut herself loose. You can sense all the stiff body language, awkwardness and self-consciousness in her films so far, when you see how freely she's breathing here. This freedom also is helped by the fact that there are no serious moments in the film, even when her character is in pretty much deep sh!t. So, that saves her from having to emote anything other than a cheerful face. Within that though, she aces her comic timing. 
The rest of the cast, including Imran Khan, look like mere pawns that are necessary to create context for her to be jubilant. Even so, while Imran Khan goes about the motions of being awed by the stunning Katrina Kaif, Ali Zafar progressively kills bits of interest you can have in his character, with every time that he opens his mouth. The accent, the mannerisms, the body language are all annoyingly over-the-top. 
Also, the story is structured such that it revolves around Katrina Kaif's character Dimple. Her free spirit attracts everyone around her to her. Sure, the dialogue is witty and there are enough laughs in there for one and all, but anyone who has seen the trailer, or even heard the title of the film, knows how the film is going to end. And that is exactly why, we won't get involved in the story. We don't invest too much attention on the story because we know by hook or crook, the inevitable is going to happen. 
I won't say the writers haven't tried to make the "how they get there" part interesting. They try and even succeed a bit in the earlier parts of the film. But as the film progresses, the situation gets more and more ridiculous. And you begin to feel the climax is being postponed unnecessarily. 
Other fillers like songs break in abruptly, but the music and especially the lyrics are entertaining. Also, the picturization - that is the dances and colors used for costumes/art work make the screen look vibrant and full of energy. 
I didn't think a day would come when I'd say that the only thing going for a film is Katrina Kaif. Take her out and the film collapses because the material is weak. Mere Brother Ki Dulhan starts with asking me to believe that an outgoing, flirtatious guy is convincing his brother to look for a wife for him and has in it everything from social pressure by families to gullible parents who are being played around by their children. They try to use wit in weird situations the characters get themselves into; they succeed partially, but it is difficult to overlook the overall disregard to sense or rather overt respect for nonsense.

Film references - "chaiiyya chaiiyya" to Dabangg. 
Dimple seems to get out of trouble as easily as she gets into it, including getting into jail because she broke rules under the guise of being a "free spirit"
@Dattaprasad @Rema @Rachit all three comments together are such an interesting read. different strokes for different folks :Dmovie is really nice i like the story and the new look of katrina.Even before you've seen MBKD, you know you can expect only so much from a film like this. A YRF film, after all, is supposed to be enjoyed like a YRF film. Just like you can't imagine Amir doing a Chulbul Panday and/or Shahrukh doing a Ghajini, it's only feckless to expect serious highbrow cinema from a YRF banner. Yes, it's got cliched characters (very!) and the most predictable plot, but MBKD still makes for a fun film. (If critics are liberal enough to shower a 4 on 5 stars to a film like Ajab Prem Ki Gajab Kahani, this one, surely, deserves lot more love).In the "different strokes for different folks" department, Meetu - MERE BROTHER KI DULHAN was fun, even if all three recent American converts to Bollywood who saw it last Sunday could see where the story was going even before we started streaming it off of Netflix. (That would be me, my kid brother and our friend Cynthia - the rest of our crowd is in Canada, communing with mosquitoes!) Katrina Kaif was a blast as a vivacious young woman who I doubt marriage will <b><i>ever</i></b> tame, Imran Khan did a good job in a part that mostly required him to react with varying degrees of exasperated affection to all the goings-on, and while I felt Ali Zafar's Luv was a bit over-the-top I also felt he kind of fit as the more lively older brother, who Khan's younger Kush balances out. There's no justification for why we liked it - in fact, I agree with every criticism you made about the movie, but we still had a lot of fun watching it. And how can you hate a film that has a big dance number while everybody (including Ms. Kaif's Dimple, who's supposed to be keeping her wits about her!) is getting stoned off their butts on <i>bhang lassi</i> - let alone the so-obvious-we-<i>pardesi</i>-got-it shout-out to AMAR AKBAR ANTHONY? Yes, Katrina Kaif is no less than enjoyable here, and sometimes quite remarkable - like when she demands Kush propose to her, and her telling him what to say turns slowly and lovingly into what she kind of wife she promises to be to him. From the roles we've liked her in, I suspect Ms. Kaif is at her best when she's called upon to be athletic and physical - it seems like all the action she does gives her license to be soft and vulnerable in other scenes as well.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
