They call it a musical drama. Is it too much to ask for at least one hummable tune or a watchable song? I am sane enough not to ask for average performances or a sensible script.This movie is about the rivalry between two music composers based in New York. The key word here is 'two'. Who wins when you have Himesh Reshammiya Vs. Himesh Reshammiya? Don't know about that. But, I surely know who loses. Us!

Mind you, we are supposed to believe that one of them is actually a genius. All this while there is absolutely nothing for you to distinguish one composition from the other. I was thoroughly amused when Reggie (Upen Patel) taunts AJ (Bobby Deol) for having silly lyrics to his tunes. Actually, he was just stating facts. But I burst out laughing when he starts singing his own lyrics. They were equally bland! All obviously written by none other than Sameer. Now, we have started rhyming across songs - 'jhoom jhoom' to 'boom boom'.
The least you can do when you set out to make a musical is provide entertainment via visually appealing songs. Better use of colors would have added infinitely to the experience. How about having decent choreographers or casting better dancers? Of all the people, Bobby Deol?!? Maybe that is why the camera man was getting all enthusiastic, so that we would not be able to focus on the aerobics in the disguise of dancing. 
Speaking of the camera - the close-ups were way too many. Okay, granted, the only reason for Kangna Ranaut and Celina Jaitley to be in the movie was for the curves they are endowed with, and the catwalk they have picked up in the name of body language. But, if you are going to show their face in close-ups, I mean, if that's what you really want to do, can we at least have the complete face with chin and all. On a side note, Kangna's eye make-up was the worst I have seen in a long time. And Celina refuses to give a whole-hearted smile lest it spoil her make-up.
I am totally convinced now that Upen, Kangna and Celina come from the school of under-acting where, you know, they teach you the all-in-one expression and punish you if you move your eyelid more than a quarter of a centimeter (except for blinking). And Bobby Deol comes from the school of over-acting, where acting is all about yelling and imposing melodrama on the audience. Oooh! Does that mean we have perfect performances as an average then? Never mind...
The script has the lousiest characterizations, which alas, we cannot blame because the characters are lousy! Egoistic psychopath Vs. Overconfident nincompoop. Anyways, you empathize with none and cheer when both of them find their way to the hospital for some reason or the other. The shoddy screenplay doesn't help at all. Some scenes look like they were thought of first and squeezed into the movie because they seemed cool, e.g., the fire scene.
Honestly, the basic premise of the story - competitors trying to outsmart each - other - could have been a compelling watch. Especially, if they had dwelled upon the psyche of the self-acclaimed genius who is actually mediocre. But, the basic premise is left at that. It finds support in none of the other aspects of film-making. We, thus, are left with a product which has no head or tail - and you could be accused of high expectations if you wanted anything like reason or logic.
Borrowing a line from the movie, "What you don't know, does not exist". How I wish that I did not know about this movie and that in turn would make it not exist...

            So-So,
            by Consumer Goods
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.A well-established singer, AJ (Bobby Deol) gets insecure because of the talent he sees in Reggie (Upen Patel). He wishes to keep his place on the top in the music industry and goes to extreme measures to do so.A well-established singer, AJ (Bobby Deol) gets insecure because of the talent he sees in Reggie (Upen Patel). He wishes to keep his place on the top in the music industry and goes to extreme measures to do so.
The scene in which Reggie is mourning someone's death. The picturization is very warm.
The special effects in the scene towards the climax. I am not speaking of the appropriateness. The special effect is cool.
Goodness...this is going to be long...

The supposedly romantic scene between AJ and Ruhi (Kangna Ranaut) looked like an interview. The tone and mood of the scene, the dialogue delivery, the body language.
What happened for Reggie to fall in love with Ruhi? Conversely what made Ruhi change her mind about Reggie in the middle of a song?!?
There is this scene where Bobby Deol is crying his heart out because of his insecurity like a lady-in-distress. And snap, the music changes and he becomes this super-egoist within the flash of a second.
In a couple of Kangna's scenes, it was unclear who she was speaking to. For most of the time, she was staring at the camera.
What a smart girl Ruhi is! She took secrets to the competition in the hope that the competition would help her sell it! 
Why did Ruhi not tell  Reggie about the indecent proposal?
One of the main insecurities that AJ has is that he takes two months to compose one tune and Reggie does it in no time. How does AJ know how much time it took Reggie to write his compositions?
The passive, resident music teacher was merely around to serve as a medium for what AJ was going through. It looked pretty silly.
Why did AJ put his music room on fire? If it was to show that he was mentally disturbed, it did not work. It looked pretty abrupt and unconvincing. 
To show you are from Jodhpur, all you need to do is put 'thaade vaaste' in the first line and the rest need not have any connection what so ever.
Why were acrobats doing circus tricks in a restaurant? And why was the seating arrangement in the restaurant like that you would see in an Indian wedding in a village?

Ruhi's character seemed dumb enough to need a friend to interpret the backwards language for her.  And what ever happened to the friend after the scene mentioned?
Ruhi is combing her hair in front of a mirror and doesn't see AJ walking in from behind.
For a musical event, Reggie begins an unscheduled song. How is the music and choreography ready for the song?
The scene in which they show AJ putting his room on fire - couldn't they have used actual fire instead of some flowing cloth/paper/animation?
The animated table clock used to show the passage of time.
It was awfully bright and sunny for a December afternoon in New York.
Did they really used a stuffed doll for Upen Patel when AJ was trying to shake Reggie awake.
Thanks, Amit.Sorry, but I have not received any e-mail from you.
