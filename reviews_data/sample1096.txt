wogma rating: The keen should rent; else TV/online (?) - No kids for company? Skip it!
    
  Though I have huge complaints in most departments, I can't deny that it's perfect packaging for kids in the 3-12 age group. With hardly any "sad" moments, the characters are mostly colorful and chirpy. But, given my reservations, should I actually encourage my kids to watch this when not too long ago Taare Zameen Par was around? Oh, why not? There's enough room for everybody.thoda pyaar thoda magic is a crash course in moral science for second graders and below. And I'm pretty sure this target audience is going to thoroughly enjoy the lesson because it has song and dance, cartoons and naughtiness. So, parents can sit happy, because kids are taught animal rights, civic sense, love over war, forgiveness, importance of bonding over blood relations, being both a graceful winner and loser, religious tolerance all in a little over two hours. And I'm pretty sure there must be a couple I missed out on.You know what this means for the adults, right? One hell of a sappy movie! Over-idealistic to the hilt, and indigestibly sweet. I doubt even songs with underwater shots of a bikini-clad Ameesha Patel can compensate for that. In fact, that's a very high price to pay for tolerating the shrill character she plays. I know-I know, that's what the character demands, yada, yada. But, it hurts to watch the same excuse being used for Saif Ali Khan. He wears one sullen look throughout the movie despite being capable of very varied range of expressions. True, his character is very somber. But, the man just couldn't cry or make me feel for him in emotional scenes. Of course, blame is equally apportioned between his talent and the way the character develops.  The transformation from aloofness to bonding, from long silences to talking his heart out is a little too quick.Is it just me or does Rani Mukherjee really look and feel almost the same in most of her movies? It’s not like she isn't trying out different roles. Yet, somehow today while watching the movie I got this feeling of "been there, seen that". Maybe it has something to do with that extra layer of make-up they find necessary to apply to make her look fairer. Anyhow, something was amiss and everyone involved just felt like they were going through the motions.Also, while watching the movie today, I suddenly realized how my kids idolize RV and Shona, the characters Saif Ali Khan and Rani Mukherjee play in Ta Ra Rum Pum. I can so visualize them now idolizing Ranbir and Geeta after watching this one. Does that mean when they grow up they are going to say, "we grew up watching Saif or Rani who were in movies for kids like us" just like we say today, "we grew up watching Al Pacino or Amitabh Bachchan who made us wanna be like them."  Scary, eh? If that's the onus they carry, they have to get better than this, because they are so capable of doing it. I digress. Coming back to the movie at hand, the dialogues and situations are pretty plain given that it's supposed to be about four really naughty kids. And the children enacting these roles are not super-adorable either. In a way it's nice to see regular kids playing regular kids. And it's better to have them do nothing compared to having them do the same old tricks that kids pull to harass adults. But that also means nothing really exciting is happening. Although some of the tributes given to various movies from yesteryears are cute. Also, the usual melodious and lively number from Kunal Kohli movies is missing here. Although I loved the way all of them were visualized. The choreography was bare minimum and the overall effect used was charming. The main problem though is we are in touch with a lot more cinema - Indian and foreign - compared to the generations before us ever were. So, obviously after this kind of exposure, it would be really difficult to spot something 'new' in terms of animation and special effects. The onus then completely lies in creatively utilizing these effects. And that the thoda pyaar thoda magic team manages to put together well. Yeah, things can appear and disappear, and inanimate stuff can dance, but how and when they do it is what counts, and that works pretty well here. The question remains - why don't we have movies that kids and adults can enjoy together?

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Ranbir (Saif Ali Khan) lands up in a situation where he is left in charge of four notorious kids. God, wants things to work out and sends Geeta, an angel (Rani Mukherjee) to help things along. 
Yeah, it's a mish-mash of all movies where kids are imposed on someone and there is a guardian angel who takes them through, here it is literally so! Hum Hai Rahi Pyaar Ke, Sound of Music, Mr. India, Bramhachari, to name a few. Also, Saif's character reminded me a lot of Shammi Kapoor's character in Junglee. 
Just a curiosity: Why was "Harry met Sally" chosen as the poster to be put up in the penultimate sequence? Was that a tribute to where the director's earlier movie, Hum Tum was taken from?Ranbir (Saif Ali Khan) lands up in a situation where he is left in charge of four notorious kids.

Just a curiosity: Why was "Harry met Sally" chosen as the poster to be put up in the penultimate sequence? Was that a tribute to where the director's earlier movie, Hum Tum was taken from?
The way Ranbir's character was established without a single dialogue, just through visuals while the opening credits were being played.
The special effects of God creating birds and clouds, cycling on the rainbow, angel Geeta playing with clouds.
The special effects in the museum. Especially with Gandhiji and the war scene ones.
The shot just before the interval, where Ranbir's reflection is in between the photos of the children on the computer screen. It might as well have been a very well processed photo set-up as the desktop background of the computer.
Picturization of "Lazy Lamhe", the special effects were both cute and creative.
Though the tributes were put together abruptly, they were cute. They covered everything from Sholay, Mera Naam Joker, Gaddar, Padosan, Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi, Liar Liar.
A typical Bollywood dance right infront with Universal Studios in the background - made me laugh!

How did they become angels if they are trying to pull another angel (Geeta) down?
I had a basic problem with the judge imposing the kids on Ranbir. What if he treated the kids badly? The judge would know only after 3 months when the damage would already be done. Or was the judge pretty confident that Ranbir would take care of the kids well? I know-I know, don't think, go with the flow...
The lighting on the swimming pool at night.
No "non-uniform" dress to school on her birthday! How sad! And why was the shower running water in the background throughout that scene in the bathroom?
Is that how Ranbir enter his house every day, stealthily?
Ranbir's monitor conked off, right? Why was he worried about his files?!
Why was the little girl standing outside the office when the computer was getting repaired?
How come none of them are wearing seat belts in the car in Los Angeles and San Diego!! In fact, I'd think the 5 year old would need to be in a booster seat!
The lip sync was pretty bad in the song shot in Universal Studios.

Uh...Ranbir was writing notes with pen and paper from something on his computer!
Why is God the only male in heaven, no men-angels? No men reach heaven? ;)

I am surprised by reading comments, who like this movie. I have also doubt about their age of mind.JJ, I watched TPTM. It was fun, yet lacked a whole lot in the details of the story and character development. I thoroughly enjoyed the way the special effects were used.Hope your wife enjoyed the movie, Ashish. I think it would make a good "feel happy" movie for a pregnant lady. Wish you luck with everything!Sorry Champu, Thodi life thoda magic is not playing in any of the multiplexes in my city. I wanted to watch and review it. Glad our views matched this time, Rahi. I can understand why people like the movie. It is light, it is clean and the special effects are cute.[...] Though I have huge complaints in most departments, I can’t deny that it’s perfect packaging for kids in the 3-12 age group.
