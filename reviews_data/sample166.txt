Noir taken to such a grim level that you disconnect after a bit and begin to look at it as someone narrating a gruesome story. Unfortunately, the story and its characters are just that – gruesome, not interesting. Titli's trailer* creeped me out the first time I saw it a few months ago. It had something very inhuman about it. Turns out almost the same trailer with a lilting background score can lighten the mood up quite a bit. There was a mystery too, which the more palatable trailer has relieved. While it releases the uneasiness, maybe that discomfort was necessary to enjoy the film. The initial shock of the concept of the film is already out of the way. Hopefully, there is a lot more in store. If nothing else, the performances are very unlikely to disappoint. *If anyone has a link to the official trailer, please share the link.

  A world that you have heard of, you know exists but have hardly ever chanced upon it. Whatever your experience in life, newspaper stories do manage to keep you aware of the cruel world out there, where a 'human' is capable of anything – good and equally bad or even worse. So intense and brutal is Titli's world that you have no option but to disconnect from it, to survive it – like difficult times in life. This disconnect however, because it is a film takes the mind to the things missing in the film – well-fleshed out characters, for instance. Sure, the characters are all grey. They are cruel and yet for the people they care about, they are tender. Yet, each character in the film comes across as untrustworthy. The world they inhabit is such – you can trust no one. However, this is all established in the first few minutes of the film. From there on, it is pretty much repetition of the same. You do wonder how Titli, the title character will get out of the mess. But, I am not sure, I am rooting for him. When one is watching out for only oneself, don't they get what they deserve? But hey, that's how real life plays out. And all departments work towards this reality. The art direction with the little things lying around in the background, the clothes the characters wear, the minimal background music along with the natural sounds. So much so that at one point I wondered if having people gargle aloud while brushing their teeth is the easiest way to get the “real” feel. There are a couple of scenes that are way too cruel that you wish them to be unreal. The cynicism of every human being in a certain environment wanting to pay pain forward gets slightly overwhelming. But, you desensitize yourself to it soon enough. And get distracted by various threads in the film left midway.Virkam (Ranveer Shorey) the oldest brother in this dysfunctional family is omnipresent in the first half. However, in the second half, not only does the character disappear but so does his effect on the youngest brother and protagonist, Titli (Shashank Arora). The one in between, the unofficial mediator, Bawla (Amit Sial) is left as that – the one who calms everyone down, except for a glimpse of his own struggle. But, the glimpse is not followed through on, then why show it at all? Neelu (Shivani Raghuvanshi), Titli's wife plays her role as a daughter and daughter-in-law but has her own secrets. The father (Lalit Behl) is the quirk, the only one who arouses a smirk in this stark environment. Titli, the film, has no room for humor. It is relentless which works very well for the film. All the actors pitch in perfectly. Shashank Arora is deadpan, which works for Titli because the brutal things that happen around him do affect him, but he plays cool. He knows how his behaviour ought to be different with different people. However, whether this will work in the next film, is something we will have to wait and watch. Ranveer Shorey's Vikram certainly deserved more space in this film. His foul-mouthed screen presence in the first film had me believe that the film was about his character. Titli pretty much says what it has to say in its two-minute trailer. After that it is like the follow-up slides in a presentation that elaborate on each point. The expansion could have added a lot of value, but doesn't quite do it.

        ...It is but natural for Dibakar to back a film that shares his cinematic worldview. The pleasant surprise here is that Titli’s co-producer is Aditya Chopra, whose directorial blockbusters so far are the polar opposite of this film. The Dibakar-Aditya collaboration bodes well for the future of filmmaking in the country. Together they have introduced us to an important new voice in Indian cinema with Titli. Welcome to the national scene, Kanu Behl.

        ...The screenplay is brilliant. It not only packs in more commentary on patriarchy than a week-long seminar, but the sights and sounds it catches add disturbingly discordant notes. The violence in the film will get discussed a lot. But in two bone-chilling scenes that will leave you cold even when you think of them later, a lot gets revealed. In the food chain, these three brothers sit squished towards the bottom, feeling the burden of millions on top. Their anger at having to crouch is scarily visible when they attack those better off than them. For those few minutes, when they are bludgeoning those on top of them, they seem to enjoy it.

This is one of those movies where the director is doing their own thing and we're merely invited as spectators, not consumers. If you are quite clear with yourself that your ticket money doesn't have to translate into certain euphoria, you can watch Titli for its splendid storytelling and also the mostly bitter story it has to tell.

This is hardly an indictment of Kanu Behl’s film, which screened at Cannes in 2014 and is now getting a theatrical release here under the unlikely banner of Yash Raj Films. It is simply to say that the universe Titli inhabits is noxious and violent, and it never flinches or softens in its running time of nearly 2 hours. In a press conference last month, Behl warned that this would not be a “cathartic film”. He wasn’t kidding.

          #Titli is good. So is @RanvirShorey. But he has as much role in the film as Rajinikanth has in Kuselan. You'll like it more without the hype

          TITLI - I wish i had not seen this movie. 
Its an odd, depressing movie - similar to Citylights.
Well made,but certain disaster commercially
        
hary103patel:
          I watched titli directed by Dibakar Banerjee. 

Its a crap movie.

 I am returning my ticket as protest.

 Please refund me.

Gaali_Leo:
          Haven't watched a more overhyped movie than #Titli in years. These 'art loving' folks smoke weird stuff. Totally not worth the time & money.
