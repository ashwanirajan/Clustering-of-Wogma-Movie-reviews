Phas Gaye Re Obama is witty, crass slapstick, satirical and repetitive in turns. Every goon in town and the politician too is chasing an American dream -that of kidnapping an American based desi for some quick ransom money. Let your imagination go berserk around this situation, Phans Gaye Re Obama offers that and more - in terms of laughs, "eeeews", and plain and simple "blehs".Phas Gaye Re Obama absolutely delivers on the sarcastic wit that the title implies. Satire runs in every dialogue and situation of the film. Unfortunately though, alongside the smart quips is also the oh-so-unnecessary slapstick. What could have been a classy comedy becomes yet another toilet-humor fest.

It is brilliant, however, that despite going the crude route every once in a while, the story doesn't shift focus from its basic plot. A slapstic comedy with focus - now isn't that a relief. In fact, there is a point in the latter half where I'm wondering how is Shastri (Rajat Kapoor) going to get out of this? I love it when the writer or director makes me think on his behalf. He has me hooked, irrespective of whether or not I'm enjoying his film. 
Of course, a film like this wouldn't achieve half of what it aims to if the actors aren't capable of getting their timing right. Here, Sanjay Mishra, and the actor who plays Anni (Manu Rishi?) are just brilliant. Who would've thought that a movie would stand tall on their shoulders? That too, with Rajat Kapoor and Neha Dhupia around, in terms of "star-value". Both of them have forced dialogue delivery and Neha Dhupia's character is too stylized. Also, the feminism her character portrays is tasteless. 
Yet, a person who enjoys slapstick is certainly going to enjoy Phas Gaye Re Obama much more than I did. So, a light, Sunday afternoon watch it is.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Every goon in town and the politician too is chasing an American dream -that of kidnapping an American based desi for some quick ransom money.Every goon in town and the politician too is chasing an American dream -that of kidnapping an American based desi for some quick ransom money.
The background music.
The camerawork, especially the long shots.

Rajat Kapoor's monologue when he explains his situation to Bhai saahab.
The repetition of the "yes, we can" joke.
The acting of the guy who plays Ali bhai
People who can barely speak English, pronouncing the word "career" the right way. They invariably pronounce it "carier"
Hey! A friend, a trustworthy source, saw it yesterday and strongly recommended it. Thought of watching it tomorrow and now after reading this, I am confused :|@Kalyan as i've mentioned, i'm not a slapstick person. As you can see from the twitter verdict it's a near hit with almost everyone who saw it :D@rahul well, i don't know about that. toilet humor and innuendoes is slapstick unless you call jokes about someone's upset tummy dark. And if it is going down a level deeper to say that a politician is suffering from indigestion because of his corrupt ways...that's a bit much, given the tone the film had set.Liked the movie although others in the family were not very enthusiastic. My reason for not being disappointed was mostly because I think I knew what to expect already in a Rajat Kapoor  movie.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.

Parental Guidance:


Violence: Slaps and kidnapping (soft on the kidnapped though)
Language: Crass at several occasions
Nudity & Sexual content: Characters are watching a porn film and there's talk about condoms
Concept: The recession and the farce that the American dream is for most people
General Look and Feel: rugged texture with light humor
