
wogma rating: Add to 'must watch' list (?)
Every syllable of the one-line plot is as common as it can get. After all, you can say "boy meets girl" only in so many different ways. Despite that when you have fun; and you care for the boy and the girl; you know you are watching a brilliant film. And since the means are good, the time it takes to get to the yawn-inducing approach to the end and the end itself doesn't hurt that bad. A bit, yes.Anjaana Anjaani might have an unusual lead pair in Priyanka Chopra-Ranbir Kapoor but they don't even remotely claim that Anjaana Anjaani is a 'different' love story. The captions in the promos yell, "All love stories are between strangers." Right there it says, it's like 'all' love stories and like them all it is a boy meets girl plot. They don't know each other and they are going to fall in love. And we are ready for an interval.
But both the synopsis on the official site and the same promo have a something that generated curiosity. 
What if the two people meet as strangers want to stay that way? They want to end right where they started - as strangers.
The thing about director, Siddharth Anand's films is that I have semi-liked all of them. His stories are human and about relationships. And he at least attempts to present a different point of view. 
My apprehension with Anjaana Anjaani though, is that even if Siddharth Anand claims, " Anjaana Anjaani doesn't have trappings of a commercial pot boiler," the official synopsis does say the sort-of new-age cliché, "They are going through the exquisite pain of falling in love, only they don't know it!". Geez...
Aisha , 
I Hate Luv Storys , Wake Up Sid , Love Aaj Kal , Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na, Bachna Ae Haseeno ...to name a few in the recent past. Let's just say, I'm looking forward to any fresh angle, notwithstanding the producer's choice of films.
Another heartening discovery is that the script-writer sounds well-balanced Not to mention, that it has almost always been a pleasure to see Ranbir Kapoor wooing his girl. Even if she looks a lot more mature than him. Then again, we've seen him with Konkona Sen Sharna, so Priyanka Chopra is hardly an outcry. 
My bigger problem is with the heavy Hum Tum- Salaam Namaste-esque ambience the trailer has. That might or might not have worked then, but I certainly don't like a déjà vu feeling. The seen-it-already and more importantly the seen-all-the-film-has reaction the trailers bring are disconcerting too. Sample this and -
 
Nevertheless, I will continue to hope for the best...

What's this crap about Anjaana Anjaani being Priyanka Chopra first love story. Please tell me I didn't dream up  Pyaar impossible ,  love story 2050 ? Just look at the film titles for goodness sake!

  Mr. Siddharth Anand and I need to have a word about lousy endings to films with decent starts and middles. That aside, I'm mighty pleased with the missing voiceover introductions. It also helps that there is no need for self-referencing with a producer who is not one Mr. Chopra. Worry not, I liked Anjaana Anjaani for the things that it is too. It is funny, it is crisp, it uses every-day, fun, and friendly quips to keep you laughing even though the story is not really moving on.

I've always been allured to the topic of 'suicide'. Does it take more strength to end one's life or to face it? No, no, no there is no such deep philosophy being discussed in the film (except for one lame monologue attempted by Tanvi Azmi which the film could have so done without). In fact, the time devoted to the three acts is too staggered. It's like two hours into the two-and-a-half hour film there was a desperate rush for a conflict. The late arrival takes away from what could otherwise have been a wonderful and I daresay 'real-life' dilemma. 
A 150-minute film with only two main characters sounds excessive. This unjustifiable excess makes film seem slow and worse yet, banality of the characters' problems comes through. Suddenly, an issue that you could identify with comes across as self-obsession of the rich and the mindless. I'm not saying I want poverty porn, but fat fairy tale in party-land got tedious for a bit. 
Sure, Anjaana Anjaani talks about the last wish(es) and hints towards the meaning of life. It's all too superficial though. Because that concept is not the focus. It's just the thread holding the two characters together. 
These two characters get to know each other while we are getting to know them too. We are a part of their journey. They remind us of friends we have; those who get drunk and are more fun than ever; those who are hurting inside but are always making people around them laugh; those who we tolerate despite their self-obsessed sulking. Thankfully, there aren't too many side characters hovering around. 
Just imagine having to see pink-lipstick-hyperventilating friend more than the two minutes of his screen time. Sheesh. We already had Zayed Khan overstaying his welcome. 
Ranbir Kapoor, well, we are too accustomed to see him fall in love and realize it. He does it well without making it look like puppy love any more (despite his puppy eyes). So well, that I expect no less from him and give no extra credit when he meets those expectations. Tough luck, dude, bane of being a good romantic hero. 
O-kay enough beating around the bush! I cannot keep myself from raving about Priyanka Chopra any more. Wow! Has the lady eased into her role as an actor on this earth or has she? Her comic timing, lilt in dialogue delivery, pauses are just brilliant. Her smile has a screen presence of its own but she doesn't overuse it. When her eyes reflect the pain she's going through, you want to hurt the make-up person who glycerinated them. 
Of course, a lot of her dialogue delivery was possible only because of the dialogue. But, every once in a while it would go the cliché way, making the eye roll inevitable. Also the writing department seems to have taken a leave when the climax was being shot. Oops! I already complained about that. Well, it was that bad. It also hurt a bit that though the movie revolved around a woman, her life revolved around the men in her life. No career, no money worry, unabashedly dependent.  I guess I have to live with it being a story about a woman like that. 
Also, such a movie does annoying things to stick to mainstream formula while trying its bit to be different. Are we such snobs as an audience that we can't take our glam doll's hair out of place even when she is completely distraught? Do we have to snicker and make caricatures out of the queer? 
An urban tale about a generation that doesn't know its way around. You can identify with the problems and the way they are put forth. Even though it is difficult to react similarly or arrive at the same solutions.

An urban tale about a generation that doesn't know its way around. You can identify with the problems and the way they are put forth. Even though it is difficult to react similarly or arrive at the same solutions.

Of course, a lot of her dialogue delivery was possible only because of the dialogue. But, every once in a while it would go the cliché way, making the eye roll inevitable. Also the writing department seems to have taken a leave when the climax was being shot. Oops! I already complained about that. Well, it was that bad. It also hurt a bit that though the movie revolved around a woman, her life revolved around the men in her life. No career, no money worry, unabashedly dependent.  I guess I have to live with it being a story about a woman like that.

I strongly recommend reading this only after you have seen the movie or if you have decided not to see it.Boy, Aakash meets girl, Kiara. They both want to commit suicide. But, fate wants them to wait. They wait together. Boy, Aakash meets girl, Kiara. They both want to commit suicide. But, fate wants them to wait. They wait together. 
Priyanka Chopra's opening scene. Must be one of the best 'drunk' scenes ever.
The set-up that sets the tone for the rest of the film.
 Xmas and new year's week is captured beautifully.
The very obvious post-production work done with the visuals, especially the tints used.
There was actually well-meaning applause at interval.
Tight close-ups of eyes and hands.

The opening sequence. Just couldn't handle the thought of having "wall street" déjà vu. The tension of having to watch another film spoiling it all was unbearable.
The hospital scenes.
The world's bucket list inspires our lead pair to make their list. 
The superhero fancy-dress song.
Isn't travel by Grayhound more expensive than taking a  flight?
The way two adults refer to sex. "nothing happened between us" something very childish about this statement.
I guess this all you could get so early as a review.Anyways nice site.@Vishal to each his own dude, is all I can say.i agree with Abhishek Bhardwaj thx for this nice siteCouldn't disagree with you more. The entire movie was a sham and was anything but crisp. The film tried hard to be funny and romantic but failed on both accounts. The audience in the theatre were getting restless and wanted the movie to end. I have my own take on this movie on my blog(which no one reads). http://devilishmonk.wordpress.com@Indian Devil the banter between the two was pretty crisp, especially in Kiara's first appearance.Dabaang was better. Except the song "bhula diya" rest is waste of time.Except the song "bhula diya" rest is waste of time. Even Dabaang was better than this one.anjaana anjaani is a very nicely made movie which always leave an everlasting impression on one who watches it....i'm fascinated by this movie a lot and its my best movie i have ever watched......especially i was deeply touched by the acting of priyanka & ranbir in this movie....they both have performed very nicely and smoothly according to the situations in the movie.....so i suggest everybody to watch this movie.....Let me guess what happened. Someone told you some awesome news just before you saw this movie and you were very happy! There could be no other explanation for anyone liking this movie!! Pathetic script. Boring PJs. Stale ending. If I ever feel like committing suicide, I will watch this again.@Kalyan ha ha ha ha! good one! I genuinely liked many parts of the film, man!Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
