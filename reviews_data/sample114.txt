
wogma rating: Watch if you have nothing better to do (?)
A thriller that cannot be bogged down by details. An action film that cannot be bothered to even attempt innovative moves.You cannot even call the events in Dishoom convenient coincidences. Because there is no attempt in showing cause and effect. The story of a top Indian cricketer being kidnapped before an important match by itself isn't very engaging. That's not to say that it couldn't have been. If only the writers had that much focus. I won't say that the writers were all over the place because you know there is a lot of things they could've done that they didn't do – like item numbers during the film or slapstick and so on. But within it's genre, it has little head or tail. A couple of sequences in fact, seem like they were shot just because they were conceived. For example, a chase sequence on bikes in a theme park has completely no head or tail within the context of the film. Similarly, Ishkiya's (Jacqueline Fernandez) existence has no head or tail within the context of the film. Especially, in the second half, it looks like she is there to provide some variety in terms of gender. Another reason could be to stand at one place and smile goofily at the characters who pass her by. Even so the lady makes the most of it, trying to provide whatever variety in expressions as is possible within the limitations of her character. She seemed a lot more comfortable than she has been in her earlier films. John Abraham is as expressionless as is possible. And Varun Dhawan is as comic as a sidekick comic relief usually is. Neither of these mean a thing, right? Varun Dhawan barely makes you smile and for all the grimness John Abraham might muster, you still can't take the film seriously. No wonder then, that when a bomb is counting down 3..2..1...you can't muster an iota of anxiety. Akshaye Khanna does bring in a tad bit of fear for a few seconds on his entry into the film, but that doesn't stay too long. That is why it is difficult to give Dishoom any benefit of doubt. For even in a comedy, you can take it seriously and laugh only if it has real comedy in it, right?

        ...On the whole, DISHOOM has a predictable storyline. However, the engaging narrative, coupled with rich visuals and high octane action work in the favour of the film. Add to this the star power of John Abraham and Varun Dhawan which will definitely attract the youth. At the box office, the film faces no competion for next two weeks and hence it will ensure good returns to the makers.

        ...Dishoom, however, despite its decent-enough story, doesn't quite make a mark on the mind. The film is a crowd-pleaser, especially when Saare Jahan Se Achha plays in the background and you need to deal with the goosebumps. Watch the film for its comedy and action....

        ...The only thing which bothers is the fact that a lot of stuff happens while you still try to figure out the scene. But maybe that's because the entire film runs on a 36-hour-long deadlock. Be ready for many highs but do not think on 'how is it possible?'. Do not forget, it's Bollywood and nothing is impossible. Go 'Dishoom' for a weekend blast!...

          :
        
        ...The suspense/thriller element in Dishoom works to keep you engaged and a fast paced screenplay helps in ensuring you are never bored but sadly the lack of chemistry between the male leads (not for a lack of chemistry between the actor but rather because of a fault in the writing), the lack of comedy, and the obvious Varun Dhawan fanfare take a toll on the whole film. Dishoom may not be a waste of your ticket money but at the end of the day it does not deliver all that it promised. If only Rohit and team had further developed this script instead of penning down half baked concepts, Dishoom had the potential to be every bit of a winner as Desi Boyz was.

        ...The first half is entertaining, thanks to the mystery behind the disappearance, Varun’s buffoonery, a few punchlines and Akshay’s cameo. John Abraham’s muscles do the talking for him, and he is good as the cop who himself breaks the rules be it in any country. Varun continues his Dilwale act, and he cracks a few smiles. John and Varun’s camaraderie is also of the first half’s highlights. However, it’s Akshay Kumar who gets the best laughs, though his act could offend a particular community. Akshaye Khanna makes an entry near the interval, and makes an impact immediately.

        ...This is Rohit Dhawan's second film after Desi Boyz and as a director he too has evolved. Unlike his debut film, where the pace of the movie was slightly slow, this movie is much faster. He has shot scenes from various angles that has allowed the editor to keep the film edgy and fast paced. The climax scene has been shot well but doesn't appear too effective. This is an out and out pot boiler film which does have its moment where logic can be questioned. But as long as the film keeps you entertained, it won't hurt watching this film.

The movie starts with a song (Toh dishoom) and it ends with a song (Jaaneman). The new age filmmaker has just added a whole lot of style to the same old substance. And as it did 20 years ago, the gimmick still works out.

        ...Conclusion: Dishoom is an enjoyable film. If you’re familiar with buddy cop movies you will easily recognise the clichéd tropes used in the movie and overlook it. The film feels breezy and it is light because the stakes are not that high. The makers have set the movie up for possible future sequels and we can only hope that Varun and John will have better chemistry if the sequel gets made. If you are in the mood to burn some steam with humour and enjoy rollicking action then Dishoom is a good recommendation. Just don’t expect a lot from it.

        ...The film belongs to Varun, who does his bumbling act to the T. He may have done it before, but he is endearing in this one. As far as John goes, since 'Dhoom' (2004), he has been sticking to the name ‘Kabir’ as well as those stoic expressions. Jacqueline doesn’t have much to do and her rescue scenes unnecessarily drag the film. Akshaye Khanna barely makes an impact in his comeback after a four-year hiatus.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Two consecutive days, two films, and both do a mediocre Houdini act. The one in Now You See Me 2 wins by a slight margin. David Dhawan is known for making the most ludicrous Hindi films.  Luckily for him he had Govinda, Satish Kaushik , and Kader Khan to rely upon.  His son Rohit continues the trend but sans Govinda.  And doesn't succeed to recreate the absolute nonsense that David was able to churn out.  Some of you might consider it a success for Rohit.Starting with the acting department, John Abraham is most likely a nice human being, an even better model.  But what he is definitely not is an actor. And least of all a comedy actor.  I have always marvelled as to how does he bag so frequently a lead role in out and out comic films???  Varun seems to have taken the challenge to outdo Uday Chopra as the jester in a home production.  And in that objective he excels.  Was looking forward to seeing Akshaye after a hiatus.  But he was in continuation mode of Tees Maar Khan.  And Akshay  (without the 'e') didn't have any punch neither.  The girls, in skimpy outfits in the middle east region (!!!!), were just for eye candy purposes  (I believe Meeta used a gender variety analogy).The story,  if there is any, got dishoomed out. A Virat Kohli - Tendulkar amalgamation cricketing hero is kidnapped just before the finals with Pakistan in a tournament in which only India, Sri Lanka. Bangladesh and Pakistan are playing.  India's reply to Rush Hour's Jackie Chan, a tough cop Kabir (K), is called in to trace the star. He is partnered by sidekick Junaid (J) on the wild goose chase through the deserts. A bar dancer / pickpocketer / druggist / ... Ishika completes the party.  Together, I J K make a complete mess of the film.  Even Satish Kaushik's Mirchi Murga / whatsapp gag failed to garner enough laughters as there was no novelty in it.  With too many explicit and implicit sexual jokes the film seems to be targeted at upper teens and early 20s youth in metros. But those youth are much smarter to fall for this rubbish. Save money and skip this one. If you are keen to spend the money then you are better off donating it to charity.It is nice watching John in action films, Varun is icing on the cake, lets not add the Akshays lest we get a reason to watch it more than twice.I have seen this movie and i feel its a full entertainment filled movie. John is a real super hero, varun was funny as hell. big thumbs upCopyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
