
wogma rating: Add to 'must watch' list (?)
Yet again, Rajkumar Hirani blends comedy with a social message and gets a point across. Even if the comedy doesn't work all that well, it is a film worth a watch for sure. Sure, this Khan's films are different from the other Khans wherein the film is likely to have some sort of a story and point. But, it is very similar to them too, in the sense that their films carry their stamp and PK's trailer goes on to prove exactly that point. The film oozes Aamir Khan from each one of its pore. Not the character PK, which would've been fine too, but the actor.It also doesn't look like the other characters in the film are anywhere close to that of Aamir Khan's in terms of importance. The lead lady, Anushka Sharma's voiceover too is talks only about his character in the film, which isn't bad in itself. Then you have Aamir Khan's exaggerated expressions and somehow for the first time I feel a little less than 100% enthusiastic about watching a Rajkumar Hirani film. Also, PK's trailer and his performance has a heavy Forrest Gump feel to it. And that is a little underwhelming, because it already looks overdone. The music isn't very encouraging considering most reviews think it isn't anything fresh and is similar to music from other films made by the same team. I see myself walking in the theater to watch PK with a little more apprehension than anticipation. But as always, would love to be proven wrong about my misgivings. Music Reviews:
Bollyspice - "3.5/5" 
dunkdaft - "will work more effectively after watching the movie perhaps" 
glamsham - "4/5" 
IBN Live, IANS - "has its moments but it's not the score of the year"  
Milliblog - "as perfunctory as every other Rajkumar Hirani film’s soundtrack" 
Music Aloud - "7.5/10"

  Rajkumar Hirani has a knack for attacking a problem headon but with a smile. As usual the issue is important, and given the events of this week, it is of global significance, though PK doesn't necessarily spread its wings that far. While the jokes are slightly on the lame side, the point made is powerful even if readers of this site might not be the direct target audience for the arguments.Most of the citybred, Generation Next a la the multiplex audience is already on the story-tellers' side. We would make the same arguments in a coffee table conversation. But the beauty here is Hirani keeps it simple. With single-minded focus he attacks the problem, quite literally, using child-like innocence. His use of humor, didn't make me laugh or even smile, but the entire theater was in splits, especially most of the first half. For matters of such importance, that most people are getting more and more right of center about without thinking it through, it is just important to get the audience to listen. So, whatever works. What worked for me the most is that PK was PK and not Aamir Khan. Sure, his mannerisms did feel a little exaggerated but they became a part of the character. After a long, long while a character he played didn't remind me it was him. In fact, while jotting my notes, at one point I found myself writing Anushka Sharma to PK! That form me was another victory for the film. Not that Anushka Sharma didn't perform well, it was easier to remember her as the actor rather than the character. A lot of the other players too - Saurabh Shukla, Boman Irani, Parikshit Sahni keep the film on its mark without attracting too much attention towards them, which is no small feat in itself. Else, Hindi films are so proficient at making caricatures out of Godmen that it is a welcome relief when it doesn't happen.But, PK is not one of those films that would need extra points for what it didn't do. It has enough going for it. Rajkumar Hirani films aren't great works of cinema in terms of other departments of filmmaking. They keep their background music, camerawork, post production to the minimum. Their focus is on the writing, (with a few diversions in form of songs and a romantic track). And they don't even rely too much on subtlety and symbolism.In fact, these are films when the characters are as uni-dimensional as they get. Also, ironically, you have to take major leaps of faith as the films have a boatload of flaws and over-simplifies complex issues. It is irksome at most times, yet you are willing to let it go. Because the films say it like it is, and keep you engaged while making a point without becoming too preachy. That in itself is a full plate. Fortunately or unfortunately, sometimes that doesn't bring anything new to a person who is on the same side of the argument. The same concern I had with OMG Oh My God. Blind faith and misuse of blind faith that feeds on fear is something we have to deal with on a day-to-day basis. So, the points made in and by PK are drawing room conversations you and I might have had umpteen number of times. It's good to see our point of view represented and presented in a manner that should make sense to those who follow God and more importantly Godmen blindly. I would applaud it for finding the balance and not defying the existence of a supreme power. To say the film focussed only on one religion would be completely missing the point. It is up to us to extrapolate it to the religion of our choice, including our own. How many of us will "get it" and be able to internalise it is a completely different question altogether. Every Hirani film coins a phrase that eventually becomes common parlance, "jaadu ki jhappi", "all is well", "Gandhigiri" and now "wrong number". Fortunately, one you don't mind taking.

        ...Rajukumar Hirani follows a certain discipline with his filmmaking. Between him and co-writer Abhijat Joshi, they make sure their screenplay has certain finesse. They use dreamscapes to push in colourful songs. They do it maintain an integrity for their characters and story. Such attention to writing detail is a rare practice in India. But it’s a healthy habit of making films. And it ensures top notch quality, one that PK has in abundance. Reiterating, this is a Hirani, Aamir Khan and Vidhu Vinod Chopra film we’re talking of. They’ve set high standards for themselves. But with dodgy and inconsistent dialogue and repetitive visuals which look too similar to 3 Idiots and Lage Raho Munnabhai, PK doesn’t quite match up to the mark. It’s certainly not Hirani’s best. But it is good enough to engage and entertain the majority of its audience....

It felt like the post-interval portions were directed by a different director and not Hirani. One of the hallmarks of a Hirani film are the strong supporting characters and PK has no character that stands out. There was too much focus on PK and that's what undid the film. Having said that, PK is definitely better than 95% of the films that are made in Bollywood. It deserves a watch but doesn't have the repeat value of 3 Idiots or Munnabhai films. Don't make the mistake of expecting too much and PK will keep you hooked....

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.What if you question everything that the Godmen say. What if you question everything that the Godmen say. 
It had nothing in common with Forrest Gump, except for the innocence that the main characters carry. 
The scene where different religions are pointed at for being   

Every one PK picked clothes from had the same taste in clothes? Or he picked and chose from whatever he took as per whatever "look" Aamir Khan was assigned.  
That PK was "used" by the media channel, but it wasn't elaborated upon  
How come the person he learned from didn't know anything about the concept of God?  
Anuj bhai shuru ho jao. Aapki most awaited film.;-)I know this is not a right place to say this but have just seen the trailer of BABY and its just awesome......Yes its a little bit similar to D DAY but it doesnt matter ,, whats better then 'non nonsense  action suspense thriller' that too having the best action hero of bollywood AKSHAY KUMAR....Pleased to see Rana Dagupati in it ,, i liked him in Dum Maro Dum,,,,he could get a boost from this one in bollywood ,, otherwise have been wasted in RGV'S DEPARTMENT....And a small mention for BADLAPUR trailer ,, which also seems to be interesting taking Varun Out of his comfort zone......about PK have no words ,, Amir is Amir and Raju Is Raju....cant be compared to anyone in present bollywood....Perfect combination....@Anup I thought the BABY trailer looked like holiday part 2 and that 'aadat se'line made me cringe.Still Neeraj Pandey gives hope.And that Badlapur trailer was effin awesome.Hope Varun delivers in a dark,mature role unlike Sidharth who looked stonefaced in ek villain.Gokul - Holiday had comic elements and a totally distracting love story with unnecessary songs ,, i dont think such things would be in baby,,,,it totally looks serious ,, a story of some unsung heroes like the line says - Ye Jina Chahte hein taaki zindagi bhar Desh ki seva kar saken ,, the basic plot looks close to D Day in which a team is made to catch a terrorist ,, infact the glimpse of Tapsi Pannu looks too close to the character of Huma Qureshi from D Day ,, but the thing is that the star cast of Baby made it grand ,, ...... The trailer teased me a lot ,, have to wait 2 months....@Fan ha ha ha ha ha@Anup Except for Rajkumar Hirani PK's trailer made me cringe. But more on that later in my preview post early next week.@Gokul @Anup Haven't seen any of those trailers but Byomkesh trailer was pretty classy, I thought.Byomkesh Bakshi is already a classy film in west Bengal ,, have seen both of its parts(is has two parts and both of them are good)....Have total faith on Dibakar Benerji that he will do full justice to the character in the process of showing it to a wider audience...@Anup let's hope so!BABY will be a dark, gripping & taunt thriller. No question about that. Neeraj Pandey will not get it wrong. Ditto for Raju Hirani's PK which will be as feel good as his last 3. If this is the kinda stuff that makes someone cringe, they may as well stop watching Bollywood altogether.@Anup : Holiday was a mass entertainer and hence had needless elements to commercialize it to the hilt. These were the same elements that impacted Special 26 to an extent (still a good film nevertheless). Hopefully Baby would be more in the A Wednesday league.@Anuj- I dont think a movie for being a mass entertainer is injected with unwanted songs and an altogether side story as a comic relief.....Its not like i dont want a love story in a serious movies....there could a love story in a serious movie,,but it should not look like a side story....Take Gajni for example ,,its totally a mass entertainer ,, and too serious in parts although without any social message or patriotism .....it has a love story ,, songs,, comic element but they are not forcefully done ,, rather they are part of the story,,,,...Murgadass has done it with Gajni but he couldn't repeat it with Holiday@Anup- There are other examples ,,, like NAYAK which was a great Mass entertainer ,, with a great theme ...  It also had a love story and a lot of songs which are totally within the plot ,, not making Rani Mukherji a sidekick.....Sorry the last comment was for Anuj@Anup : Mass entertainers do not have one standard definition. All the 70's blockbusters of Amitabh Bachchan were mass masala entertainers but in different genres. While the likes of Zanjeer,Deewaar,Trishul and Laawaris were revenge themes, the likes of AAA and Namak Halaal were more towards the comic side. Similarly even in the last 5-6 years we have had mass masala entertainers of varying genres. The reason I rate Ghajini,Dabangg,Agneepath and Singham ahead of everything else is because these films stand out in terms of content coupled with entertainment value. But even there, there's a marked difference. While Ghajini & Agneepath are dark broody revenge themes, Dabangg is more of a mass comic cum action entertainer while Singham is trending towards the social side. I'm quite amused and baffled when the pseudo brigade places the likes of Singham,Dabangg and Agneepath in the same bracket as cheap,crass,offensive,replulsive and retrograde wannabe entertainers like Action Jackson,R...Rajkumar,Zila Ghaziabad,Boss,Himmatwala and the likes. No wonder the latter have flopped and have been rejected by even B/C center audiences while the former four were lapped up by A/B as well as C center audiences, not only in cinemas but even on television (as proved by Singham's historic run on satellite television).Factfile : Singham (2011) is the most watched and popular film on Indian television since Shlay and Andaaz Apna Apna and its TRP's over the last 3 years have even crossed the likes of other hugely popular Television films like Swades,A Wednesday and Lakshya!@Anup- Its true that Gajni , Agneepath , Singham , Dabang , Wanted have been great entertainer ,, and they should not be mixed with the flop masala movie....but with the help of these movies many bad movies have earned high incomes which encourage them to make much more bad movies without any plot ,, doing high promotion showing action scenes hit song etc.....Dabang -2 , Singham Return , Ready , bodyguard , R Rajkumar......etc(worst of them all until AJ came....)Indian audience is needed to be careful while selecting movies to watch in theaters....dont know how this mistake of name is happening but that was again for anuj@Anup: smartphones are too smart. Once it memorises a text then when you type a similar text that it does not find in its dictionary,  it automatically replaces that word by a closer fitting word. So, your smartphone seems to have memorised "@Anup". And then when you type "@Anuj, which it does not find in its dictionary, it replaces that with "@Anup".@Fan- That may be the case,,,,thank god my smartphone is taking '@Fan' in a correct manner....But jokes apart i dont think we  are here to discuss on Smartphones....LolsssssThe year 2014 is drawing to an end. And barring PK all other offerings have been seen. And as far as PK is concerned I have this feeling deep in my guts that even though commercially it would be a hit but as a film it's going to be mediocre. So we're heading for the end of the year and what a lousy year it has been wrt Hi-Fis.  Just nothing comes up to mind as memorable.  I am even having difficulty to say who could be nominated for awards. It has been that bad a year.  I won't nominate Haider as I don't want to encourage anti nationals. I might go for Mary Kom, but it is more on aandon mein kana raja mantra rather then on sheer brilliance.  Or to be completely original I might go for Khoobsurat for giving a bubbly Archie's style chewing gum light entertainer. But that's about it.Looking forward to a better 2015.@Fan Don't understand your grouse with Haider but you seem to have forgotten Highway and Queen which are IMO better than Mary Kom and KhoobsuratHighway was a remake of Subhash Ghai's Hero and a poor one at that. Just because Muzaffar Ali or similar sounding yuppie makes the film doesn't qualify it for greatness. Queen might have been a sleeper hit but I have still to figure out what is so great about it. If somebody would invite me to re watch either of those2 films then I would respectfully decline.  Watching a snail crawl by would be more interesting.@Fan - If that's ur opinion on QUEEN then thank god u r not nominating ..... Although i agree with u that Haidar is not worth of being one of the nomination and i also agree that Khoobsurat along with Humpty Sharma ki Dulahniya are really entertaining but they too are not gonna make to nominations.....Highway and Queen are sure gonna make it to nominations along with PK ,, and until now Queen is the best one with universal acclaim from critics as well as audience....Seriously there hasn't been  any Bollywood movie got such high ratings not even 3 idiot.....But along with these 3 movies there should be atleast two more ,, and thats the hard one to select....I would be highly disappointed if nomination are done on the basis of income earned like what happend in last year when almost all the awards have been given high grosser shits....   For me the forth movie nominated should be a flop one which i know many would not agree is Dedh Ishqiya .... But than again we can just say what we think and like ,, we are no one to select officially ...Note- There could be a chance that 2 states get nominated because not much good movies are there ....but i dont want it to be ....@Fan Well we both have clearly different tastes in movies but have to say Khoobsurat is a long shot to win any awards@Anup Well if five films have to be chosen,I would choose Haider,Highway,Queen,Citylights and,I know many of you haven't seen it,Ekkees Topon Ki Salaami.EKTS was a good satire.And I guess Shahid and Tabu are sureshot winners for Best Actor and Supporting actor.@GOKUL - defiantly agreed that Saheed  had a good chance of getting the award but still the movie was not worth of it(ofcoarse for me)....Still two of our nomination matches.....But i would suggest u to keep one spot blank as years biggest movie is still to come on 19th Dec.....PK could have the ability to turn the table totally towards it,,,,as Aamir's movies have done it before.....Cant judge it just with the trailer....And yes haven't seen ETKS and u r the first one to recommend it....May be sometime.....Hope Pk turns out well:).With Badlapur,Hawaizaada,Dolly ki doli,Roy,Shamitabh and Rocky Handsome,we have some exciting times ahead@Gokul: Khoobsurat remark was a joke to highlight what a poor year it has been.  For all the lovers of Queen, please could someone give some objective reason for it being a good film?  Only reason it worked was because there was a draught of good films; and a slightly decent film comes across and people are happy. The year should be marked by giving no awards to prove that nobody performed well. Otherwise why would they perform better next year?Haven't seen EKTS so can't comment.  But it's such a low profile film that it couldn't be awards material.  Had it been good then people would have hyped it up.@Fan Will I guess everyone liked Queen because it was a rare female-centric film which was fun.All the other earlier female centric films earlier were either dead serious like Gulaab Gang or pure garbage like Aisha.And it had some seriously good performances from Kangna and Rajkumar@Fan- No movie can run so many weeks without being really good just because there are less good movies available....Queen Had earned its income constantly week by week for a long period.....Let me tell u just one reason why its good,,,,because me and almost the whole multiplex theater in Gaziabaad in which i was watching it audience are falling out of their seats laughing....That was just the first day....The same thing happened again when i watched it for the 2nd time in the 2nd week.....And guess what,,,,i enjoyed it equally when i watched it on my laptop after 1 month for the third time....And i can easily watch it for the forth time,,and also after that....Just that aa single movie and many young actors and actresses have already expresses their curiosity for working with Vikas Bahl the director....He has the capability of taking care of each and every scene of the movie.....Infact Alia and Saheed got chance working with him in his upcoming SHANDAAR ....@Anup: Sholay ran House Full each and every show for 5 consecutive years at Minerva.  Clearly shows how much it was liked by people. Still, when it came to awards season it bagged only one for best editing by Dwarka Divecha.  It lost on Best film, best director, best supporting actor,  best story, best screenplay,  best dialogues. Just to highlight what Aamir Khan and Ajay Devgn have been saying since years that the awards are not genuine. Having said that, I do accept that in one of the plethora of awards available nowadays, Queen would prove check mate. On the other hand I am not so sure that Imtiaz Ali's Hero meets Monsoon Weddings on the Highway would do any wonders. The rest of the honours will be shared by big buck earning films like Bang Bang, Happy New year and if PK turns out to be good then PK. Like it or not that's the way it is with hi-fi awards nowadays.My top 3 films of 2014 thus far :1. Queen2. Mary Kom3. Mardaani 4. Singham Returns5. HolidayPK will surely be among the top 5!Correction-Top 5Happy New Year won the best film at screen awards!!!!!And the other nominees were Bang Bang,Kick and Ek Villain.Let's all take a moment have a good laugh at it.I quite liked Ek Villain as well. Thanks to Ritesh Deshmukh. Definitely a lot more entertaining than Mohit Suri's last sleeper hit Aashiqui 2 which was a snoozefest.@Anuj: Ek villain,  humpty dumpty, bobby jasoos, etc. Just goes to prove that it was a year with sub standard quality of films.@Fan: Amused to know u have such a high opinion of Queen :P@Anuj: honestly Queen sucked. It's a juvenile plot and even worse mislead naive non metro girls to believing that you could stroll into any European city without any ounce of fear. Europe and its flesh traders are as bad as it can get in any country.  And roaming around without cash and without knowing local language is an invitation for trouble. Ignorance is bliss.  And success of Queen in India goes to prove that expression.  No wonder that Queen was below par in overseas territory.@Fan Bollywood and logic never go together. And by your logic Batman inspires every millionaire to be a superhero.How come opponents of masala films suddenly start hiding behind what they detest when their pseudo intellectual puerile bluff is called?@Fan Good word you have there 'pseudo intellectuals' If I prefer a Queen or a Highway over a Kick or a Singham makes me an intellectual then so be it.Nobody hates a good entertainer(Guardians of galaxy,Wanted,Go Goa gone)but it gets suffocating when all the films come out the same.Films like Queen,Highway and Haider come very rare in bollywood(where the regular fare is an Akshay Kumar or a Sonakshi Sinha starrer and if it is a festival,a Khan film)Films which choose to have a story and not just be a cash grab.The reason many youngsters(including me)prefer Hollywood is because for every Transformers movie coming out,there is an Interstellar or a Boyhood coming,but here after every Kick we keep getting a Singham reurns,Ek villain,Bang bang and Happy new year.@Gokul - Agree on your statememt 'The reason many youngsters(including me)prefer Hollywood is because for every Transformers movie coming out,there is an Interstellar or a Boyhood'. Thats the reason I was looking forward to only 2 films (PK and Haider) this year, whereas in Hollywood if we skip a Transformers or Expendables we know an Interstellar or a Gone Girl is coming.Yeah but next year seems to be good, there are few I am really looking forward to.How come opponents of masala films suddenly start hiding behind what they detest when their pseudo intellectual puerile bluff is called?My list of all time favorites includes the Sholay's & Deewar's as well as the likes of A Wednesday, Kaminey and Parinda. Unfortunately the pseudo brigade often mistakes my fondness for the likes of Dabangg & Singham as my craze for masala entertainers. The fact of the matter is, I love purposeful films with a motive and one's that blend content and entertainment in equal measure. Be it a Queen, a Dabangg, a Lakshya, Deewaar or A Wednesday! The bogus one's are the likes of Haider, Dedh Ishqiya and Finding Fanny which are neither entertaining nor catering to any audience except a few armchair pseudos who fantasize on the Vishal Bharadwaj's & Anurag Kashyap's of the world. Films like Haider and Finding Fanny are just wannabe artistic cinematic classics which factually fall flat on their faces. Perfect "chutzpah" films!"It's a juvenile plot and even worse mislead naive non metro girls to believing that you could stroll into any European city without any ounce of fear." ~ yeah well A Wednesday did not mislead me or any of its fans to believe that we could plant fake bombs across India's largest metropolitan and give a run to the cops. Neither did Deewaar make me the massy Bachchan fan of the 70's believe that he could become a mobster for earning a quick buck and avenge his loss. Nor did Lakshya make any Roshan fan wanna join the military. Movies can obviously not be taken literally and the same goes for Queen. PS: By your logic, the Phunsuk Wangdu of 3 Idiots would have encouraged its fans to start impersonating in exams :PThat above comment if for @Fan"'The reason many youngsters(including me)prefer Hollywood is because for every Transformers movie coming out,there is an Interstellar or a Boyhood'"~ for every Dabangg we have a Kahaani and for every Ghajini we have a Taare Zameen Par. That Hollywood is over-rated and out of ideas is a fact that even Hollywood film-makers and audiences themselves agree to. Of course we Indians (half of whom are wannabe NRI's) with a colonial hangover will never understand this point of view.D - 3 days.It was in the year 2009 when the film industry was struggling and recovering from what had been quite a disastrous year, both in terms of box office as well as in terms of content. The came Christmas and along with it brought a literal hurricane in the form of 3 Idiots. The movie ran to packed houses for almost 2 months (unheard of in the modern era), smashed every record in the book, became the first films to cross 200 cr (unheard of figure during those days) and became a cult spanning across A/B/C centers as well as the NRI diaspora. Cut to 2014. Another mediocre year full of underperformers and rejected films. Another season of Christmas & another Hirani-Aamir venture. History is all set to repeat itself. Mark my words, every record in the book will be broken, the crowds will run riot & this films like all other Hirani ventures thus far will be a memorable cinematic experience of epic proportions! Fingers crossed.Only thing we'd miss is Boman Irani without whom a Hirani film never really feels complete :/@Anuj This year we had Bang Bang,Jai Ho,Kick,Happy New Year,Singham 2,Holiday,Entertainment,Gunday,Heropanti and countless other 'Entertainers'.Haider,Highway,Queen,Finding Fanny and Citylights are among the few films that at least TRIED to be different.Whether you liked them or not is subjective,but we need to encourage these filmmakers who are trying to push the boundaries.A film like the Lunchbox which got recognition worldwide is still unknown to many in our country.And can you please stop this 'pseudo intellectual'garbage.Nobody is an intellectual because he watches certain films.You may call hollywood over rated but it has for weeks in and out being delivering better films than ours.@Gokul: the few films that TRIED to be different happens EVERY YEAR.  It is not that suddenly in 2014 some guys tried to different.All things considered, those who TRIED to be different, and those who tried to cash in on going trends, etc. have all produced a mediocre year.  And encouraging mediocre films is like saying Yeah good job, continue giving us the same.  No, as a film goer I cannot accept such trash - I deserve better cinema and the past few years have shown that we could produce better cinema.@Fan I'm not saying 2014 has been a good year for films.It has been a disastrous one with very few good films.But it has been constantly inundated with films trying to reach 100 cr. rather than films trying to tell a good story.If you think you deserve better cinema then you need to support good cinema.Prabhudeva or Rohit Shetty or Farah Khan won't give you better cinema and they unbashedly admit it.And hasn't been every masala film since Dabangg been just a copy of it.If you watch Happy New Year over Haider and say you want better films,nobody is going to take it seriously.That is why the first couple of months of 2015 looks exciting because there are some good looking films coming with even the festive date(26 jan)seeing two films which seem to have a story.Let's hope these films succeed and bollywood learns to stop taking it's audiences for granted.Agreed, Bollywood must stop taking its audiences for granted.Its Time for Indian Writers to wake up and understand that even MASALA ENTERTAINMENTS are needed to be unique in some manner......This year almost seems like our writers have been sleeping........Have to experience some plotless movies like Entertainment , Humshakal and AJ.....But the good thing is that audience have rejected some of them......And its the audience who can show them such movies are not worth of our money......Hope Pravudeva , Farah Khan and his Brother are listening.....@Gokul: Armchair critics and a miniscule part of the audiences are pseudo intellectuals of the first grade, no doubt about that. No wonder when a Finding Fanny kinda directionless trashy film based in Goa has Punjabi lyrics in its theme song, they call it different but when a serving military officer single handedly demolishes sleeper cells in Bombay city or a cop hunts down criminal god-men, they call it "masala & stereo-typical". Films like Finding Fanny & Haider are not "different". They're just wannabe film which are neither here nor there. No wonder they are rejected by their own target audiences viz the urban multiplex audiences. Finding Fanny hardly found an audience even in the 5 start upmarket multiplexes of metropolitan cities. Similarly films like Humshakals and AJ are pungent piles of trash which too are rejected by their target audiences viz the single screen and B/C center audiences. Ultimately it all boils down to how your "target audience" laps up a film. A movie like Finding Fanny or The Girl in Yellow Boots does not have a target audience itself.PS: I'd much rather watch a Singham-2 and Holiday over a Finding Fanny & Haider. The reason why Queen and Mary Kom have worked is because they blend strong content with perfect entertainment value, much unlike the critical acclaim hungry nonsense like Finding Fanny,Khoobsurat and Haider."Its Time for Indian Writers to wake up and understand that even MASALA ENTERTAINMENTS are needed to be unique in some manner." ~ its also time that the Vishal Bharadwaj's of Bollywood stop making controversial "chutzpah" nonsense like Haider and deliver superior "entertaining" films like Kaminey & Omkara.@Anup: As I noted somewhere earlier, the real culprits are producers (and not writers).  The producers are not willing to spend money on writers because they (falsely) believe that taking a few home grown and imported films, mixing up plots, and producing a masala curry with VFX together with a star thrown in is a guarantee for good ROI.And so for the producers it is a waste of money (and hence reduced ROI) to invest on writers.  They just need some fellow who is willing to do the bhelpuri mix as requested.@Anuj Again different people have different opinions.If you can call me a pseudo intellectual for watching films you don't like,I too can do the same.You liked Singham 2 and Holiday,good for you,I found them utterly bad,now does that allow me to call you a fool???If Haider bored you,sorry for you but there are people out there who liked it.I haven't seen Finding fanny and can't comment on it but from the trailer it looked better than all the masala garbage.Anuj - True what u said That Directors like Vishal Bhardwaj should make movies like Kaminey , Omkara and Maqbool which are a lot better then Haidar but on any day I will select to watch Haidar or even Matru Ki bijli in place Of AJ or Humshakal.....There is a difference between a crap and a movie which bores....Haidar was below average as per the standard of VB himself but it was not crap.....Infact the movie will be a great competitor for in award show for Best Actor , Best actress and Best Cinematography.....Crap doesnt have such things......Fan - Its not like there hasnt been producer for good movies.....There are many production houses although some of them are small appreciate good stories ,, Phantom Production has been great in this case co founded by Anurag Kashay Vikash Bahl and Vikramaditya.....Even Karam Johar has come forward for supporting small directors and writers.....Biggest example has been THE LUNCHBOX which has gained so much love all over the world and become a profitable venture world wide.....Infact there is a festival which occurs once in every year in India where all the new directors and writers showcase there stories so that they can get producers.... Lunchbox , Ship of Theses and Miss Lovely has come to big screen with the help of that festival.......D - 2 days.Tickets are booked for Friday night show. Let's hope that it would be money well spent.@Gokul: I call them pseudos and self obsessed because there are dumb critics like Raja Sen, Mihir Fadnavis and their cronies who define "good cinema" within their own limited realm and a lot of these armchair critics and fans of "film festival cinema" have been guilty of spitting upon and even mocking the masses for their choices. A typical example of this is a couple of worthless users on this website itself who have universally branded Salman Khan fans as "illiterates" and what not. Its high time these chaps are shown their true place and worth. @Anup : I'd rather see our critics and fraternity encourage more content oriented "entertainers" like Vicky Donor and Jolly LLB than snoozefests like The Lunchbox (mainly 'coz this boring piece of art has been "acclaimed" by the western media and the NRI diaspora).@Anuj The thing you are missing is films like Haider,Lunchbox or Highway are never made out to be 'entertainers'.Their trailers didn't mention they have slapstick comedy or item songs.They are made for audiences who like to immerse in the emotions of a character and continue its character's journey and all the three films have been very good at.You can't watch Action Jackson expecting a mind-bending story,similarly can't expect Haider to be toned down so that a wider audience watch it.Anuj - Of coarse critics always encourage movies like Vicky Donor and Jolly LLB ,,.....Nothing wrong with that....But why not LunchBox....Its not just appreciated by western media but by western audience too....Otherwise it shouldn't have been a profitable venture.....I dont know whether u know the fact or not  the LUNCHBOX became 2014's highestgrossing foreign film in the United States......made on a budget of 10 crores it has grossed more then 80 crores worldwide and also got more then 25 crores in India,,so was profitable both in India and outside.....And thats just box office collection ,, when we comes to critics rating on metacritics its has almost equal rating to INTERSTELLER which is a product of my own fav director,,infact all critics have predicted this movie could have won oscar but its hasnt been selected by our foolish indian Jury.....Such a shame.....But i guess such records doesnt matter to u just because u dont like it......Please understand that ur dislikeness cant make a movie Boring piece of art.....U should start respecting what other people like,,,,its a much bigger world outside ur mind.......But is there any point in classifying films as entertainers, good or masala. Its to each his own right.So far in this discussion I can make out Haider, Lunchbox and Highway as good films. But to me I loved Haider, Highway was strictly OK and absolutely hated Lunchbox.Jj: films,  like any product, must be classified as  good or bad. Period.But there are some who go with the theory that if it's a massy entertainer or masala then it is bad, because to appeal to masses it must lack logic but I am a well educated intelligent Indian and so I cannot like logicless films. And so mass entertainers are bad films for them. And those same people tend to associate self proclaimed intelligentsia's films as crème de la crème and so consider them good films regardless of how shaky the contents are. And such pseudo intellects or armchair critics are a pain..  Such people tend to categorize films and tend to stay away from watching massy entertainers.  Whereas me and many other masala film lovers watch all kinds of film without discrimination.  I have watched the disgusting and unbearable GOW, I have watchef Haider Queen Highway, I have watched Kahaani Wednesday,  I have watched unbearable stuff like Himmatwala and Humshakals, I have watched ZNMD Singham Holiday Wanted .I also regularly watch Hollywood products.  I make no discrimination before watching, but thereafter I classify the products as good or bad.   And Haider Queen GOW Himmatwala Entertainment Boss Ra1 Happy New year etc qualify as rubbish. Haider had good performances but its anti national tone makes everything a zero. As Kochadaiiyaan said it Desj se bada koi nahin hai :-). And so Haider promoting anti national elements is a strict no."films, like any product, must be classified as good or bad. Period." ~ but that classification varies from person to person depending on his or taste and sensibility. You might prefer Black Dog scotch whiskey but for me, Foster's would always be my favorite ;)  Similarly one might consider GOW as a classic and one might say the same for Dabangg. Both are correct in their own realm as long as they do not start insulting or dissing the other (which unfortunately a lot of the so called intelligentsia indulge in and hence they need to be replied in the same vein). As I had said on another post, 99% of Bollywood watchers would disagree with me but for me, Deewar>>Sholay! That does not make Deewar a superior film. Its just mean I "consider" it to be a superior film. And unlike a lot of folk who form opinions based on bogus critics and their cronies, the one's with a mind of their own form their own opinions only after watching a film for themselves. And hence I have no qualms in saying that I did enjoy the experience of watching a Krrish-3 and a Dhoom-3 on the big screen despite them being panned by the critics and the intelligentsia. Going by the box office performance, I can easily say that I'm not the only one loving these films.@Anup : Hollywood critics are no different from the one's back home, Irrelevant. In fact Interstellar got negative rating from NYC critics while the same folk has gone gaga over a pungent pile of horse shit like Slumdog Millionaire (which apparently won multiple Oscars, perhaps coz the jury was on drugs).@Fan First and foremost Haider is a piece of fiction and rather a very good one.They never said it is a true story.It may be as realistic as a Rohit Shetty film,but still remains a good film.The film is not anti-national,it is anti-establishment.It says how the war which have over the years turned into a ego fight over the years has reduced Kashmir into just collateral damage.(which is true,if you haven't been tripping on Border).If you believe the army interrogations are non-violent,you must be very naive.The AFSPA is a very ridiculous law and it speaks against it.The film is an adaptation of Shakespear's Hamlet and Kashmir is just a backdrop for the protagonist.@Gokul: tell that to the family of the soldier who has been tortured and killed. The film is not anti establishment.  Had it been then I would have accepted it. The film is pro terrorists. The film is anti military.  Military is just doing a job there which is not even theirs.  They are doing it to the best of their ability in a physically and physcologically hostile environment. They are far away from their homes and facing such hardships so that intellectuals like you can sit securely and write some rubbish in the name of liberal thinking. Haider is anti national and no amount of criticism is less. It does not present a responsible point of view.  Kashmir is used as a backdrop for the protagonist is irrelevant against the way it has been portrayed.@Fan I am not saying I don't respect the military,I have the utmost respect for them.I don't see how the film is pro-terrorist,if anything it calls for end of a war that has been for years killed many including the soldiers on both sides of the border.It shows how the AFSPA is a ridiculous law and should have not have been passed.It shows the carnage that has happened over the years in Kashmir while we have been sitting in our houses and making claims for Kashmir watching Border.I really want to know what makes you think it is an anti-national film.It raises the question whether the war is worth the thousands of lives it has taken alreadyAnybody can show what's the problem.  Only visionaries and leaders can show solutions to the problem.AFSPA, someone doesn't like it.  Put some other policy and somebody else wouldn't like it.   Responsible film maker would have proposed a solution.  Tying hands and feet, blindfolding and gagging military and then leaving them to terrorists is not a solution. Highlighting unproven allegations of torturing by military with the sole aim to get more brownie points for the film. All these make your liberal intellectual film maker same as a Prabhudheva. One is flogging controversial false propaganda for brownie points and the other is flogging a southern remake for green points. I support the other as there are no pretensions of a good responsible film making.@Fan, so who is supposed to classify them as good or bad? Is there a regulated authority which I am not aware of or is it audience like you and me. If the latter, there's bound to be opinions.@Gokul: cut to the chase.  Good or bad is a personal choice.  But saying that because it is a non massy film or made by some guy (or gal) having pretensions of being intellectual does not make the film good or bad.  Just as the reverse is not true, i.e. a film made by a popular entertainer does not qualify it automatically to be good or bad.Often educated people tend to put label of bad on massy product and label of good on products made by supposed intellectuals - without actually experiencing the products.  The reverse phenomenon might exist but relatively in much less proportion.And finally: irresponsible film making is bad, regardless of how well the actors performed or other departments performed.  Anybody doing an irresponsible act just cannot be encouraged - be it in films or in schools or in offices or in any aspect of life.@Fan Dude I can't stress it enough,FICTION,ever heard of it?????They never called it a true story.It is an adaptation of Hamlet and the army plot is just the backstory to set up Hamlet.Nobody neither Vishal nor Imtiaz called their films intellectual,it is us people who have been used to formulaic films week after week,call anything non-formulaic intellectual.Fiction does not imply that you take needless liberties and make needlessly controversial films on tense political issues. Had Haider been a work of complete "fiction", they would never have started the films with "Srinagar, India 1995" or cleverly brought in things like AFSPA. Anyways, no point spoiling the festive mood when we have a Raju Hirani release. Ladies & Gentlemen, get set for the biggest blockbuster of the decade thus far!@Anuj Fiction completely means taking liberties and for Srinagar,India The film is set in KASHMIR.@Gokul: so you are admitting that Haider is fictional.  And because it is a work of fiction it is not a statement against the military, and that in real non fictional world the military is doing a good job?@Fan Nobody,neither Vishal nor Shahid said it is a true story.It is Shakespear adaptation for god's sake.The military has always been doing a great job.It is the douchebags who makes the decisions who are the problem.Early reviews suggest that this one is a classic. Just what I expected from Rajkumar Hirani!@@Gokul: nobody on this page has said that it's a true story.  But that doesn't mean it is not a reality and it's a manifestation against reality.  Thanks for having accepted that the film has not depicted the reality.And so now let's move over to PK. Anuj is just too excited and so let's give him the space to express his excitement.  @Anuj: for which show are you booked for watching it the first time?@Anuj it's too early for a word of mouth.  The day had just started when you put up your post.  Even the hardcore filmy guys who go for early morning shows wouldn't have watched the entire film when you posted. So calm down. Take a deep breath.  And think of that report that you had planned to finish for your boss ;-)@All: I think that I have asked for trouble by provoking Anuj just hours before he is all set to watch his favourite film:-)4.5 stars from Taran Adarsh.  Ouch. That hurts.  He held back half a star. Does that mean something in the film is not good?See you folks tomorrow. Signing out for today.@Fan : Taran does not review for bollywoodhungama anymore. Even the other reviewers have given it 4-5. Watch the film. I'm sure all your cynicism will go for a toss :)@Fan : I'm watching it tomorrow morning. After you. So its evident who's more excited about this :P@Anuj Oh come on! What's so wrong with being excited about a film!So, how similar is it to K-PAX, if at all?BTW, saurabh shukla's twitter handle is: @saurabhshukla_sMeetu, you manage to write notes in between a movie? How do you enjoy the movie then.In your Talaash review too you mention that Aamir Khan was not Aamir Khan. Your expectations from him is that low?Booked for evening show. Cant wait :).The expectations were not this high ever like it has been for PK....That's the problem with it....Raju Hirani's Track Record is brilliant ,,, and thankfully will remain the same after PK at least until his next movie .. The Munnabhai Series was great .. Being comical with thought provoking  concept is something which is liked universally. With 3 idiot Hirani and Aamir Khan had made a masterpiece , a movie made with perfection without a single flaw. So whats beyond perfection ! Nothing . And that's where PK stands , behind perfection and behind 3 idiot.The Belgium sequence between anushka and sushant was the most uninteresting part of the movies although in between that the Char Kadam song was really fresh and sweet to watch.. .Up to interval the flow was nice , no melodrama , full comic elements(although the level of comedy was not high as it was in Munnabhai and 3 idiot).Its the 2nd half where film drags a little bit and pull it down from perfection. The problem is that the way Hirani has tackled with the concept of God vs Godmen was no new. It was  similar to OMG starring Paresh Raawal and was more hard hitting in OMG as compared to PK. And also the climax was of the track concentrating on the love relationship  instead of the religious belief and the questions movie has asked earlier.Don't think i have to say anything about Aamir's performance. He has mastered his acting capabilities with each and every film . To play an alien is not an easy work but he has killed it. Anushka looked too cute , a girl to whom anyone can easily fall in love with , what exactly happened with PK too.  The song Bhagwan  by Sonu Nigam has been picturized with great emotions. PK is a nice movie to end the year with , only if Hirani didn't have made 3 idiot before PK , it would have looked much better.Can't say this one was the best of this year , for me QUEEN got that position , still its one of the best this year have given us.As been appreciated by 75%+ of the audience but 10%+ are given it 1 or less stars may be they are fans of himmatwala, besharam and action jackson kind of cinema, PK is set for roughly 225cr as i see this minority bent on spreading negativity.  Cheers to Hirani, Chopra and Khan.Talking of Raju Hirani & Vidhu Vinod Chopra, the trailer of their next production venture starring Amitabh Bachchan & Farhan looks mysteriously stunning. With Baby & Byomkesh Bakshi, the first quarter of 2015 definitely looks promising for thriller genre fans.Quite surprised nobody talked about the highest rated film on imdb none other than Chaar Sahibzaade 9.6/10 apparently grossed 30cr in India despite a first week of 4cr, audience says it is an emotional tale of the sons(four) of The tenth Sikh Guru.Good film.Outstanding? Not at all.  Certainly the weakest Hirani product from the 4 that he has offered.  And keep in mind that weakest is relative to his films and not compared to all the hindi films that are churned out from Mumbai. I found OMG better than PK for the message that was targeted.  And Meetu,  whilst you and me might be tolerant enough to say that no particular religion is singled out; but unfortunately the visual medium is so powerful that the message many will take home is about a single religion being mocked off. A lot like A Wednesday where many sincerely believed that it was a pretext to bash a certain religion; also believed and openly written by a reputed critic. All in all agree with Wogma rating.First half was a funny zany ride. 10 out of 10.Second half dragged, and how?  Worse was the climax where things just conveniently fall in place so that the movie could be ended on a feel good note. Associate such shoddy stories with YRF and not RHF.Come to think of it, the more I think about what I watched the more I think that it was an average film.  And for the standards set by Raju an average film would be same as a horrible film.@Anup: son your standards of perfection seem to be too low if you classify 3i as a perfect film. Popular film: yes, universally liked: yes, perfection personified: NO!! If I start ripping apart the deficiencies then suddenly arguments like 3i being a work of fiction or literary licence will start popping out.@Fan - without any offense that makes my thoughts and your thoughts are wide apart which was already cleared when u put Khoobsurat in ur top 5 movies of this year and said Queen and Highway are bad movies..Excellent  first half.  Raised all the valid questions. But could not conclude well.  Climax was too convenient. Given the license to overreact aamir nailed this performance.PK is a typical Hirani feel good candy floss entertainer with a strong & thought provoking social message. Would be my second highest rated film of 2014 after Queen. Kudos to Hirani and Aamir 3.5/5@Anup: offense can only be taken when it's meant.  I don't think that you intended to offend and hence non taken.  I too didn't mean any offence but something tells me that you were offended.@Anuj: it's probably in your top 3 of 2014 because it has been a lousy year. On its own it's an alright product,  and as Meetu put it that if you are not a keen film goer then wait for DVD (or on TV).+ve's :1. The biggest positive of the film is the fabulous performance of Aamir Khan. Its amazing how this actor keeps rediscovering himself and adapts to every role with near perfection. From the blood thirsty killer in Ghajini to the playful college goer in 3 Idiots to the brooding cop in Talaash & now to the bhojpuri speaking alien in PK, this man just never fails to impress.2. Rajkumar Hirani's direction as always is top notch. PK follows the trademark Hirani trend of glossy, sugar coated light hearted films with a strong social message and Hirani once again gives us ample evidence of why he's a master of his craft.3. A special mention would have to be made for the supporting cast of the film including the likes of Saurabh Shukla, Sanjay Dutt, Boman Irani, Sushant Rajput and most importantly Anushka Sharma. All of them enact their part to near perfection thereby making this movie an absolute viewing pleasure.-ve's : 1. Its hard to point too many negatives in a movie as entertaining as this but the one that immediately comes to mind is the draggy second half, the hasty ending and the needless songs.All in all, PK is a perfect year end festive entertainer and like Hirani's previous films, is a sure shot box office Super Hit. It might not become the cult that 3 Idiots became, but nevertheless will perform extremely well at the box office.Rating : 3.5/5 (Good)My ratings for the 4 Hirani films thus far :1. Munnabhai MBBS : 3.5/52. Lage Raho : 4/53/ 3 Idiots : 3.5/54. PK : 3.5/5More at http://bollywoodboxofficedata.blogspot.in/@Fan- If thats what u think then m sorry to tell u that u r wrong..My ranking of Hirani films1. Lage Raho2. MBBS3. 3i4. PKFor all those trying to find the silver lining by harping the good social message part, sorry for breaking even that flimsy straw that you are clinging on to. There is no social message in the film.  If any then please enlighten in one sentence what the message is? If you can't then stop the madarigeri and have the guts to admit that Raju/ Aamir failed to deliver.Mr A - I worked with a mediocre director in a film that wogma users did not want to watch and delivered 40cr on day 1  Mr B - I worked with top class director in a film that all wogma users except ehinome wanted to watch but only delivered 25cr.24.8cr on first day its game over you guys just be content with overtaking 3 Idiots, lol this is Talaash returns in Hirani style.To play the devil's advocate: what's wrong with Hindu god'smen. What's illegal or immoral about it? How does it harm the common man? Keep in mind Raju not even for a nano second showed or hinted at the type of godman that the recent Haryana based godman was depicted by media.To think that PK producers asked single screens to charge 250cr per ticket, once said cinema is not for poor persons, now Aamir is practicalising what he has been doing from Ghajini days, everyone knows RNBDJ was a better appreciated film but now his film will lose hands down to Kick.  Congrats to Maratha Mandhir and Gaiety Galaxy and others for boycotting this armtwisters not the nonsense allegations a certain Chingam brought against YRF.Ehinome: I don't think that Rab Ne was good.  It was equally worse.As regards PK, the distasteful word of mouth is increasing after day 1.  Targetting Kick in terms of earnings is a major challenge.  Which is a pity, because Kick should not be the benchmark as it itself was not a good film neither.And at the sake of repeating myself, the more I think about the film the more I am hating it.Bang Bang Day 1 earning was 28 crores.@Anuj: in your one negative you've already bundled 3. And each of those three negatives is several times heavier than the flimsy positives that you are trying desperately to identify. No amount of sugar coating can hide the fact that this is a bad Christmas present. Talking of Christmas,  I will take your leave for a few days.  But rest assured that I will be back soon.Well both ----Jodi and Ghajini were more or less average films the truth is this Aamir uses gimmicks to take the shine of others why cant Irrfan, Rajkumar Rao or Nawaz act with reputable directors in a commercial film this Khan wants to have all good things to himself, despite giving the most number of successful films on imdb, he never received a national award so no evidence he is rated better than Salman or Shahrukh, his case is yeah i am an average actor who selects good scripts and good directors, reckoning has caught up with him, bye bye to the Khan era.@Fan the question itself is not about the quality of Pk, it is more or less if it is suitable to its audience, in fact persons are tired of dis Aamir and Christmas is a dhamaka, people want something different is it wrong if Iohn or Emraan teams upp with VVC and RH.  Film is exceptional in Mysore, Nizam, Delhiand West Bengal that is why its imdb score is high not to forget the issue of manipulated inputs by multiple ids.Has underperformed in Gujarat though most parts of Mumbai are solid, Bihar, UP, Rajasthasn, Assam, Orissa, TNk, CI, CP circuits.26 cr on a working day. Hold your horses. Its much better than u make it sound FAN. Anyday better than Srk and Salman garbage this year.Your negative harping aint gonna make a difference. Its a superb entertainer and 26cr on a working day is a superb figure. Hold your horses and wait and watch! Hirani never fails. Even on his worst day he gives a 3.5/5 filmSaturday is close to 29. Senseless haters go into hibernation. Thi a movie will rock the box office and carry the years best word of mouth after QUEEN. For the rest, keep whining u losers :P@Fan : Your opinions are of no relevance anymore since u rate Chennai Express over PK. I know how to rate my likes and dislikes and need no suggestions. Thank you!@fan: in a span of 24 hours u first called it good, then mediocre and now substandard. U need a rest!Its gonna be a 90 cr weekend without a holiday. Negative wom my foot. Time for the whining crhbabies to stick to their Chennai Expresse's and Happy new year's.Fan after 1st watch: decent film....after 2 hours: average film...after a day: horrible film...after a month: TRASHFan after 6 months: offending my sensibility...anti religious...boo hoo boo hooSenseless haters who wanna be comparing day 1 collections of PK on a non holiday with big festival films like HNY and BB, wait for the first week to end.For all the cynics trying to spread negativity around PK by equating its opening with Dhoom-3, please keep in mind that Dhoom-3 was a franchise that catered to the urban and mass center audiences alike. PK on the other hand is mainly targeted towards the tier-1 and metropolitan crowd which would obviously lead to a reduction in footfall. Nonetheless, such is the popularity of the Aamir-Hirani team that despite being targeted towards a limited audience, PK might still end up being the highest grossing film of 2014. Of course this is no 3 Idiots. But that's mainly because 3-Idiots is a once in a generation film and one of the 9 All Time Blockbusters of Hindi cinema. Such feats can never be repeated (just like Srk can never repeat a DDLJ and Salman can never repeat an HAHK).Direction: 3    Story: 4    Lead Actors: 4    Character Artists: 2.5    Dialogues: 3.5    Screenplay: 3.5    Music Director: 1    Lyrics: 1Will someone tell me if the film is actually good or Aamir ne phir se chu banaya????PK = Lip job gone badOh My God was far better than PK. Next time Raj Kumar Hirani should hire a good editor to edit shit from his bullshit to give a bullish movie.@Gokul : Watch for yourself and find out. I'm sure u have a mind of your own that's capable of making sound judgement based on its choice and sensibility.A good healthy 10-15% growth on day 2 indicating a positive word of mouth among the multiplex audiences. 54-55 cr in 2 days. The weekend would go to 87-88 cr which is phenomenal for a non holiday release.pk -Sins and Wins Movie ReviewThe 'Sins and Wins' team consists of guys who have an inherent passion for writing, creative expression, and creativity in general. We write spoiler free reviews that receive positive feedback from our readers.The last time Rajkumar Hirani and Aamir Khan worked together, the output was '3 idiots'. The last couple of times that Rajkumar Hirani and Sanjay Dutt worked together, we had the two 'Munnabhai' movies. This time, Hirani, Aamir Khan, and Sanjay Dutt have partnered up for PK. Obviously, expectations were high. Does the movie live up to the hype or does it provide just enough fodder about which to gripe? The review by Sins and Wins follows:Sins:For starters, we'd like to clarify that the movie is not a 'perfect' depiction of reality by any stretch of the imagination. There is no denying the fact that it has plot holes, even glaring ones. However, it would be fundamentally flawed on a viewer's or a critic's part to gripe about them. The movie is not about 'understanding' reality, but about looking at our version of it from a different angle. So, many of the sins that you will find in other reviews of the movie have no place here. Stating them as sins would not be an intelligent thing to do. The greatest analogy is not one that is completely accurate, but one which makes the most effective point in the most effective and efficient manner.1. Most of the songs are a 'bhaste of time'.2. The attribute that differentiates faith from all other feelings is that it is hard to break. It often leads to the development of psychological barriers in people who then fail to entertain conflicting ideas, no matter how convincing they might be. The depiction of faith as a fragile quality is hard to agree with.Wins:1. Aamir Khan-Aamir Khan just looks possessed with his acting. You will have the impression that you saw only him the whole time. Acting without efforts! Clap clap!2. The roles and screen time of each and every actor are not without justification. In short, every sequence has that 'precision tag' nicely weighed and measured and handed out to you so that you love yourself for purchasing the ticket.3. We'd like to label 'Rajkumar Hirani' as India's answer to 'Christopher Nolan', the difference being that Nolan uses a lot of science and philosophy to explain his ideas, while Hirani explores and depicts important social aspects in a satirical and light-hearted manner.4. How disillusioned are we from reality, that we call upon religious 'gurus', a.k.a., 'managers of god', to provide solutions to our problems? A person who knows nothing about 'our version' of reality might actually know a lot more about reality than we do. This, being the principle motivation behind the movie, has been depicted beautifully.5. The movie 'exposes', quite literally, a lot of the scams that religious fanatics resort to in order to instill a 'flawed' version of faith in people.6. The movie never debates the existence of a creator. It does, however, throw some desperately needed light on the very important and the very 'neglected' question, "Do we worship our 'creator', or our 'creation'?"7. The storyline which the director has chosen to have a shot at, will keep you on the edge of your seat always demanding for more. The topics related to creator, destiny and logic behind some crap presented to the society by dharm gurus and our understanding to the concept of 'co-existence' couldn't have been more logical or presented in a more practical way.8. The best thing about the story is that everything presented has a wonderful and impressive base. Say, why pk? Or, why Aamir's overly innocent looking acting as witnessed in the trailer? Or, why Anushka and Sushant's separate relevant sequences? Everything just could not have been more descriptive and accurate. That's what you call a perfect backdrop of all the good things about to happen.9. All the actors in the movie have acted amazingly well. The hallmark of a great director is that he makes not the characters 'come alive', but 'seem natural'. This is what Hirani has managed to do with the entire cast of the movie.10. The movie presents an unbiased view on all the major religions. Contrasting sides of an argument are presented.11. Hirani is just like a wizard, isn't he? Plain and simple looking scenes will make your belly ache and your lipstick ashamed of you. It just feels that, he produces a scintillating wave of everything which a viewer expects by springing life into a seemingly ordinary looking sequence. We would brand him as 'A great psychologist' of the 21st century', worthy of sitting on top of his profession.12. The movie has that capability to make you cry at the end mainly because of 2 reasons. One, there is heavy and justified emotional touch in the end. Two, you won't be able to see Amir's acting for another year. Alas!13. The plot is so fascinating, you remain very very satisfied and dissatisfied simultaneously, as you see the movie fading to its last few sequences.14. The satirical nature of the screenplay keeps a viewer interested throughout. Humour is an inherent attribute of the movie.15. The movie is Hirani's signature to an argument, 'Should we try something new every time we take to the reel?' When you see the movie, you will definitely know that the movie world certainly exists beyond business for some. You will witness things, you haven't seen before and that's a 'sins and wins' guarantee.Our rating- 9.7/10P.S.- 'It is an art movie that entertains throughout.'Superlative 36 cr Sunday and a historic 90 cr non holiday weekend. PK seems to be going from strength to strength and rightly so. This one is all set to become the top grosser of the year. My sincere [comment partially delete for use of abusive language] salute to all the cynics creating needless negativity around the film right from its first day of release.Happy New Year : Historic 42 cr on the post Diwali holiday, historic 100 cr weekend thanks to day 1 but crashed to an under 190 cr lifetime.PK : Decent 25 cr on day 1 (working day), builds and grows to an 88-90 cr weekend and will top the charts for 2014. Time for the [comment partially delete for personal attack] to go into hibernation like they always do :PA list actor - I always finish in the top 5 of richest actors worldwide  B list actor - Despite doing Ghajini, 3 Idiots, Dhoom 3 and now PK i never made it to the top 10 in India, even Baby and Holiday star is far richer than me  A list actor - Because you enslave yourself to film producers while i am a big producer in India.  B list actor - I think you steal the money my films make[comment delete for personal attacks]I guess okojoker's applying for a CA job to maintain the bank balance of [comment partially deleted for personal attack]!A list actor - Yeah i make a lot of cash from my films and business B list actor - My highest grossing productions star Darsheel Safary and Imran Khan A list - that says it allTevar and Baby are comingThe so-called B list actors whose the first to enter the 100/200 and 250 cr club has enough assests to buy out the fake king's entire production house and a lot more. This is the level of desperation Srk fanatics have dropped to now since every single movie of his for the last 7 years has been pulverized into submission by his nemisis. That indeed says a lot about the baadshah and his bhakts! Tevar is on Jan 9th, so for the next 3 weeks its PK all the way! Even 250+ figure is possible after the historic performance on Sunday.PK Has Huge Weekend - Phenomenal TrendingMonday 22 December 2014 10.30 ISTBox Office India Trade NetworkPK has had a huge weekend of around 92.50 crore nett. The film had a start which was not up to the mark at places but on Sunday it had extraordinary numbers all over with all circuits at record levels or close to record levels. The film grossed 26 crore nett on Friday, 29.50 crore nett on Saturday and 37 crore nett on Sunday. The business is being driven by multiplexes with multiplex to single screen ratio much higher when compared to other big blockbusters. The trend of the film is phenomenal with a 11 crore nett gain on Sunday from Friday.  This can happen when a film is very lopsided towards multiplex collections as Saturday and Sunday are best days for multiplex collections. The mass centres were excellent on Sunday and if this continues it will post a huge lifetime total, possibly the biggest ever.http://boxofficeindia.com/Details/art_detail/pkhashugeweekendphenomenaltrending#.VJfZ0F4A0Lol @ gimmick stars             Bad Film - 102cr weekend            Good film -  87cr weekendA list actor - I topped Forbes Magazine power list 3 times before another A list actor did so B list actor - I looked for my name in top 5 and it was not there last year i was 22nd.So @whoever stop your IQ bragging cos you aint got anything special for you to compare PK with Queen shows your sense of misguided humour.  Queen day 1 - 1.6cr  Lifetime - 56cr  PK day 1 - 26cr Lifetime - 936cr, lol @ your logic.So a high iq dimwit who judges stardom by the crores they put in their coffers compares trending scores of a 25 cr film aimed at 25% of the audience with a 100 cr productoob aimed at 80% of the audience. Wow!Big films like PK and HNY have footfalls in crores, half of which come within the first 2-3 days itself. And unless the word of mouth is really good, no one recommends or goes for a second viewing. Hence the trending score in terms of % is obviously inversely proportional to the film's budget,release size and initial theatrical footfall. Films like Queen are watched by just 25 lakh people in theaters and only 10% of them watch it in the first weekend. Its obvious that the trending scores in % would be a lot higher for smaller films like Queen. Its illogical to compare the Queen's and Mary Kom's with PK's and HNY's. As for a bad film doing 102 cr in 3 days, its still >>>> better than the HNY's of the world. Its high time crazy Srk fanatics accept that Aamir has much better script sense and does much better content films which carry positive word of mouth than their favorite star who needs to reply on publicity gimmicks like Forbes and online polls to maintain his ever sagging popularity.Remember how the Lunchbox decimated a certain dhobi ghat all over the world.  Even Tusshar Kapoor will give 100 cr in 3 days with PK lol."Even Tusshar Kapoor will give 100 cr in 3 days with PK lol." ~ no he won't...and Dhobi Ghat pulverized Dulha Mil Gaya all over the Interstellar universe...time for u to stop whining now!Rakesh Roshan - I made Krrish 3 with A lister and crossed CE by 7%  VVC - I worked with a pseudo-alien and could not match a film (HNY) that had < 78% occupancy on its best day.VVC & RH - When we discovered our comment deleted because is a funny attack star would not deliver, we inserted the song love is a beast of time.Even Monday is all set to cross 20 cr which is double of what HNY and Bang Bang on their first Monday. @Fan: i told u...this movie could possibly not have failed, come what may! Day 4 figures suggest that the trend is positive and word of mouth is excellent. We're in for the long haul, 5 years since the geniuses' last All Time Blockbuster!Want to watch PikuRajkumar Hirani comes again with his team. This time he also cast Sanjay Dutt alongside with Aamir Khan in the his latest flick PK. The movie already entered in the 100 crore club just in the four days. http://indianmovies.pk/ offing this movie online.175-180 cr in week 1. UNBELIEVABLE! PK is well on its way to replicating the performance of 3 Idiots. Here's what it needs to do further :http://bollywoodboxofficedata.blogspot.in/2014/12/3-idiots-vs-pk-box-office-performance.htmlAre Anujbhaiya, aapko bolke gaye the na ki krismas ka kuchh dinon hum nahin aa sakenge.

Tanik hum bhi to jaane ki kis baat ki pungi baj rahi hai.@Fan : Ever since the first trailer of PK you have been whining and crying about how it seems "mediocre" in your ridiculous and laughable definitions of quality which classifies films like Chennai Express as "pataka entertainers". I'm sure you're [comment partially deleted for offensive langauge] seeing the kinda admiration and word of mouth PK has received over the days. Yes the message is out loud and clear that its high time we as a society give a boot to fraudulent godmen looting and fooling people in the name of religion and caste. Unfortunately your brains which seem to have become junked by all those Rohit Shetty films seemed to have missed the point. Or perhaps you yourself believe in sadhus and tantriks and hence feel fidgety about an Aamir Khan delivering PK while the same u was laughing,hooting,clapping and stripping when an Ajay Devgan (of a different religious clan) goes about thrashing tantriks in an action entertainer. And anyway, i do not see the point of justifying a film carrying near cent percent positive word of mouth to a guy who refers to Jaadugar among all the Amitabh-Prakash Mehra films or who rates Rohit Shetty ahead of Raju Hirani or one who considers normal kissing sequences as uncultured and uncivilized. Yeah 2014 has been a miserable year for the cinema lover in u. Now weep some more while let us sane folk enjoy our PK's and Queens'.Its commerce     Hirani; which religious group is least   interested in cinema   VVC; Hindus    Hirani; Why   Aamir; Because when Eid and Christmas come   there is cheer @cinemas, but when diwali   comes there is no dhamaka.   Hirani; Dont you think it is because of a   certain Khan who releases his films on that   Hindu holiday   Aamir; Even the Roshans released Krrish 3    on diwali and we know what happened   VVC; Yes K3 was more anticipated than D3,   had K3 released on Christmas or Eid it    would have made 300 cr.   Hirani; Why do films underperform on Hindu   holidays   Aamir; Thats because Hindus prefer to stay    with godmen as against spending their money   on wholesome entertainment   Hirani; What script should we have   VVC; What script, show naked hero. bhjpuri  language, prostitute, love jihad, fraudulent  babas. and may be live sex.  Aamir; I cant have sex with a prostitute  VVC; they are all the same  Hirani; We will use the song Love is a  Bhaste of time in place of sex  VVC; thats why i like you, if he were a  certain Kashyap he would have insisted on sex  Aamir; How much are we targeting  VVC; 350 cr.  Hirani; Phir Milenge171 cr in week one  13.3 cr on second friday  275 cr here will come  Bye bye to Dhoom 3's record.Aamir; Why do you make bad films SRK; I am not as fortunate as you anytime i tried good films i got Swades and MNIK (flops).Salman; Same for me@Ehinome : You're wrong on that part. The post diwali day is the most fruitful in terms of commerce as proved by HNY making over 40 cr on day 1. Even Krrish-3 made 33 cr on the post diwali day last year despite that being day 4 for the film. Its just that of late diwali releases have not been up to the mark in terms of audience anticipation and no wonder most barring the exceptions of Golmaal-3 and Krrish-3 have underperformed. Had 3 Idiots, PK or Dabangg released on Diwali instead of X'mas or Eid respectively, i'm sure they'd have done the same business. Similarly had Krrish-3 released on X'mas instead of Diwali, it still would have been 180-190 cr and no where near 250 cr.I watched both Chennai Express and Ek Tha Tiger i understand if ETT had broken 3 Idiots record, but CE though was entertaining for about 25% of its runtime, but it was apparently let down by an SRK trying too hard to be funny. SRK has been a midcarder in this industry for a long time, think the only years he showed raw star power were in 2002, 04, 07.   CE was a reincarnation of sorts for SRK and if FAN directed by Maneesh Sharma gets a 60%positive word of mouth, am sure all records will tumble next independence, have seen someshots from that film, looks like an Om Shanti Om without the reincarnation theme, fingers crossed.Anurag Kashyap's Ugly day 1 - 40 lakhs,  so this is what someone gets for being praised by an insignificant audience.....say what you might...this Anuj guy is consistent....in his belief ...balance others are thali ke baigan ...were happy when the day 1 collection was lower ...now happy that it is soon going to be highest grossing movie of all times....Lol dats d world for you, i was pro Aamir last xmas now anti Aamir dis xmas,  @ whoever i fought with Anuj over Aamir last year and we switched sides this year and still fought.By the way PK made $3.54 m in its first weekend in the US, roughly the lifetime of multistarrer HNY. Only confirms the fact dat Aamir is No 1 in the US  My take on Bolly stars in the US/Canada  1. Aamir Khan  2. Ranbir Kapoor  3. Hrithik Roshan  4. Shahrukh Khan  5. Salman KhanPK will not repeat 3 Idiots trend because of less viewer/theatre ratio as compared to 2009, Tevar, Baby/Dolly Ki Doli, but it will trend like Dabangg, a trend similar to Hirani's previous film will give it a lifetime of 435 cr.@Anuj: the movie being such a pakau that you were asleep or were hallucinating whilst watching the film. Pray where was the godman shown as fraudulent. Pray where did godman RH and godman AK show the Hindu godman indulging in illegal or immoral activity? To the contrary godman AK is shown encouraging doing illegal activities like peeing in a public place and over burdening police system by abusing the law.so dear hallucinating friend who keeps on flip flopping between Rohit Shetty Hrithik Roshan being greats to dimwits; someone in self induced delusion who can't even correctly read and understand written text.@Divya: good joke.  Tell me another one. Lookup Singham Return and Bang Bang discussions.  And Anuj is drooling with excitement on them. And if someone were to read only this page then you would think that Anuj hates them to their core.As regards PK making loads of money,  that was clear even before the movie came out. There are enough sucker NRIs who believe that if they have to watch only 1 Hindi film a year then that must be the godman AK's film. No harm in paying 500 Rs to the godman AK. But if their parents pay 100 Rs as donation to a Hindu godman to listen to his lecture then that's a crime we must condemn and punish.In fact i nearly posted that Rajkumar Hirani was the new godman of bollywood with Aamir as his prodigy, anyways there is no point whining as no one asked Bhardwaj and Kashyap not to make entertaining films and no one asked Sallu and Rukhy not to make unique films lol. Actually Saurabh Shukla was playing Hirani, Chopra and Khan in one role.@Fan: you're the one who seems to be hallucinating right now. Where did i criticize Singham 2 in my comment? Apparently that's the only decent film Shetty has made since Golmaal 1. As for PK, its even running to full houses in single screens now. That's how positive the wom is! Nri's stay overseas and tge movie is smashing records in every domestic territory including mass centers like Rajasthan. High time u accept t have fact that your taste has gone for a toss. Or perhaps visit the nearest gidman's pravachans. After all, a godman making predictions about a man's charavter based on his religion or branding something sold to him as Shiva's gola has to be nothing short of fraudulent.*since Golmaal 1 and the frame by frame remake Singham 1. As for Bang Bang the rating on my blog was an average 2.5/5 from day 1. And ya im still a huge HR fan. Dunno what's that got to do with PK."As regards PK making loads of money, that was clear even before the movie came out."~ yeah, that's the reason y u were doubting PK's credentials of going past Kick and becoming the top grosser of the year after a 25 cr day 1 when I stuck my neck out and maintained that this film will break records in the days to come. And mind you, the kinda collections PK will end up with and the kinda trending its had, its the first of its kind since 3 Idiots. PK like 3 Idiots is receiving accolades from all sections of the audience be it A,B or even C centers. The film is setting records in even mass dominated territories like UP/Orissa/MP and Rajasthan. After all, a lifetime figure of 300-325 cr ain't possible with the help of multiplexes alone. @Ehinome: By that yardstick, Sholay adjusted for inflation is 1000 cr, HAHK is 700 cr and DDLJ is 600 cr. These figures are unrealistic and impossible. With every passing year and decade, the release size of a film increases, the theatrical footfalls keep decreasing due to internet piracy and the chances of an extended run keeps reducing by the year. Its unrealistic for even the biggest of hits today to be crossing INR 400 cr at this point of time. A direct inflated value of 3 Idiots is 450 cr but a more "normalized" value adjusted to these market changes and factors is around the 350 cr mark. If PK does hit 350 cr, it would be in the same category as 3 Idiots,Gadar & DDLJ.@Anuj: classifying a whole film as masterpiece because a godman labelled pakistanis as unreliable in a 10 second shot is not less than any blind god worshipping. And btw if you are up to date with any current affairs and world trends then all major international opinion pollsters and influencers label Pakistan and Pakistanis as unreliable.  That is their opinion based on their observations and experiences.  Right or wrong is immaterial most important is that it's not illegal and it's not fraudulent. So sorry to have ripped your stupid explanation on ehy the film is great. If the film has a great message then you should be able to give many examples FROM the FILM to explain why the film is great.  Till that time the scores stand at Fan: 1, Anuj: 0.And please don't give me crap about 600 crores to explain that the movie is great.  600 crores represents fan following.  As abroad in India too there are tons of educated guys who believe that if godman AK says or does something then he must be supported.  That doesn't mean that the prasad is as tasty as godman RH and godman AK is trying to make it seem.@Fan First Haider and now PK,seems like you get easily offended by movies.Well I guess people like you need to be offended@Fan: ya dude...everyone right from the multiplex audiences to the nri diaspora to the single screen audiences to the C center audiences are fools. You're the only patriotic and intelligent Indian left on the soul of this planet. And yeah 600 cr does indicate huge popularity and acceptance, much unlike the likes of HNY and Bang Bang which fizzle out by the end of week 1 itself!@Fan - dude just one question,,WHETHER UR EYES WERE OPEN OR CLOSED WHILE WATCHING PK ?. because it totally seems like they were closed........Even i think PK was not Raju Hirani's best but ur comments are like not 'PK' but 'U' are a person from some different planet..Who totally didn't get the movie..U should watch it again with some concentration and yes with OPEN EYESSS.dear god please help this child of u..He is really confused..@Anup and gangwhy can't you folks argue on factual objective lines? All attempts from my side to get an objective reply are only met with personal attacks and character assassination.  In a way it gives me the reassurance that even blind followers of godman RH and godman AK are (a) unable to give any example of what great social message was shown; and (b) intolerant of blasphemy of objective analysis of one sided unilateral discourse of godmen RH and AK.I rest my case that content wise this is pure garbage.@Gokul: for Haider we went through the discussion and you concluded that what is shown against the military is false. Just for the records,  even if I am alone in defending my military against false and unproven allegations then I would do so.As regards PK technically and story wise it's a weak second half.  Scroll up and we'll see that everyone from Meetu to Anuj admitted to a under par 2nd half.  And as regards contents apart from somebody who believes that a Pakistani is unreliable there's no other"problem" exposed by godmen RH and AK.  And if you have dealt with Pakistanis like I have done then you too will soon form that opinion.  Does not mean that each and every Pakistani is like that. But high probability that a Pakistani is unreliable. Holding and stating that belief is not a crime,  at least not till the last time I had checked our constitution. So what's the great message? I hope that you have the answer or otherwise the decency to admit that content wise too the film is weak.The message is that we as the human species should not distinguish ourselves on the basis of caste, creed, religion & nationality and believe in ourselves as humans first. Nor should we waste our time and resources in any mindless superstitious  and beliefs. Its the same message that Akshay Kumar's character gave Paresh Rawal in OMG and its the same message that AK's character is giving Anushka in PK. Too bad that certain individuals snooze while watching cinema which is a good blend of both entertainment and content. No wonder i'm not surprised when these individuals call films like Chak De India and 3 Idiots as "over rated".For Fan....Paise kamane Se aapko dushmani hai, kahi aapka koi private tapu to nahi.Aamir or PK Se bhi aap chidate ho,Kahi aap Aasaram Bapu to nahi.@Anuj: and what's the problem if humans are grouped by religions? My religion does not preach hatred or jihaad. And just when did godmen RH and AK refer to superstition? And regarding wasting time on belief (or faith) the film clearly said that there is god and it is alright to have faith in god. So we are back to square one I.e. a simpleton alien called Fan happens to come across a community on wogma who are whole heartedly converted to the message of 2  godmen called RH and AK but are unable to explain to somebody who is trying to understand with a child's innocence on what the hullabaloo is about.Unconvincing arguments given so far:Generalizing Pakis as unreliable is prohibited here. Alright, but be aware that every credible international survey states that  Pakis are unreliable. Another argument forwarded: having religions is bad. Alright,  but I don't get it why is it bad?Yet another argument given is that superstition is bad. But as per Anup I was asleep in the film so missed the scene where that was subtly hinted at. But as Anup was wide awake during the rhetoric of godmen RH and AK he would most certainly enlighten us about the superstition part. Or Anuj might do us the favour. Final argument (so far) forwarded is that the message is of stop wasting time on faith.  But the portions of the film where I was definitely awake gave the message that it's alright to believe in god and have faith in him. So this innocent alien called Fan coming from planet .IN wonders how come the message was exact opposite of what was said on the screen?All in all unconvincing defence of godmen RH and AK. With regards to difference between OMG and PK, the former attacked the misuse done by society personalised as insurance companies on the name of EVERY religion.  It was uniform and balanced in its portrayal of every religion.  It did not single out Hindus as godmen RH and AK. The singling out of Hindus is so evident that I referred to it in my first assessment and so did Meetu, it was that obvious.  And to have the garb of being equal in treatment to all religions they showed some references to other religions but totalling max 30  seconds of reel time.  This innocent observing alien from IN wonders why the ills of godmen who run religious schools and instil in young impressionable minds that they must  kill others in the name of holy war that their prophet has advised.  If OMG would have made a film like PK then they would have taken heads on such madrassas.Anyway,  you still have the right and opportunity to redeem yourself by explaining to this innocent observer and questionner from IN as to what makes YOU ALL believe that godmen RH and AK have given a good message?@Fan I said that because you overanalyse films and do not take them for the piece of fiction they are.And the films you got offended by are the two best films of the year.@Divya: na hi mein Asaram Bapu hoon, na hi unka samarthak.  Aur jo bhi legal tarike se paisa kamata hai mein uska samarthak hoon.Parantu aapke godmen RH aur AK mein himmat nahin thi ki Asaram Bapu jaise ghair kanooni kaam karnewaale aadmi dikhaye. Jo Prakash Mehra ne dikhaya tha, bapu jo illegal activities drug trafficking or woman trafficking katte hai. Rohit Shetty ne bhi Singham 2 mein dikhaya tha. Aise bapuo ki jaroorat nahi. Par godmen RH aur AK ne simple aadmi dikhaya jo harmless pravachan ksrta hai. Senior citizens ko man ki shanti milti hai 2 ghante bhagwan ka satsang sunne ke liye.  Thoda prasad ka 200 Rs de diya. To kya hua? Kya tum bhi apne time pass ke liye bar mein ya disco nein doston ke saath nahin jati. Aur prasad ka 200 (ya 2000) Rs ka kharcha nahin karti jante huve ki alcohol sharir ke liye achha nahin? Mein to karta hoon. Har age mein ek harmless activity chahiye.  Uska thoda kharcha hota hai.  Parantu use boora keh kar band karwana kahan ki sharafat hai. Agar godmen RH aur AK ne drugs, rape, prostitution,  terrorism sikhane waale baba dikhaye hote to mein samajh sakta ki sab kyon aand shraddha se godmen RH aur AK ke pichhe lete lrte jaa rahe hai? Par vaisa to kuchh bhi meine dekha nahin. To yeh aap ka blind following without any rhyme or reason saccha hai; aur hamare maa baap ka bhagwan mein bharosa blind following aur boora ho gaya???@Gokul: technically PK is below par. Everybody has accepted it. So then it cannot qualify as the best film.As regards work of fiction that's an argument that weak minded use. I am just trying to understand what I perceive as double standards. This exact film - without even 1 millisecond of change - if made by a David Dhawan or any other similar category director - and everybody would have made fun of it. EXACT SAME FILM. But because it is made by Hirani and Khan, it becomes blasphemous to even think that there's a defect. From where I am, I see no difference between you folks and those religious fanatics (that the film didn't dare to dhow) who killed Galileo for saying antichrist stuff like the planet earth is spherical and not 2 dimensional flayt ground. Be it an Asarambapu or Hirani,  if you accept everything without questioning then you are not only insulting your brain you are also giving them green signals to continue taking you for granted.So basically ...till there are few rape scenes to establish the credentials of the villain you won't accept him as villain ... He may continue spoiling lives through pravachans (case in point ....Jaggu ...by putting doubts in her mind ) but till we add a few murders ..he is paragon of excellence....bhai...tu Jake mithun ki movie hi dekh...paise Bach Jaye to baba ka Prasad kha lena@Fan You may say the direction sucked,the acting sucked and such things and that is your opinion but you are complaining a fiction film about not being politically correctDats life Kashyap makes a film it grosses < 20cr, Hirani makes a film it grosses >250cr.Anyways we have Bajrangi Bhaijaan coming up so there will be dhamaka, Fan will rock overseas box office for sure. btw Kareena denied rumours she will be sporting a 6 pack for the former.Well PK has been almost universally accepted as a good film, guess is a nice farewell to mr. perfectionistMy own grudge with PK is why the star is a non Hindu, what happened to others.  This awards and box office race gives the illusion that only non Hindus can act or entertain lol"Technically PK is below par. Everyone has accepted it"~am still to hear snyone say that barring u. As for DD making such films, the point is that he CANNOT. Th ed best he can do is come up with Rascals and Main Tera Hero!Just read that certain fringe groups are vandalizing theatres screening PK. Wouldn't be surprised if @Fan is part of that group :P50 cr in 2nd weekend. Even a 100 cr second week is possible now. Staggering numbers! Its evident that a large section of the audience is going for repeat viewings. This is surely another 3 Idiots in the making. Aamir would become the first actor to deliver 2 All Time Blockbusters of record breaking historic proportions. Ditto for Hirani the director. Unbelievable!@Anuj - why two why not three....Gajni's grossing were also historic at that particular period of time..It had set benchmark for our own famous 100crore club movies....@Anup : Ghajini's gross was historic indeed but so was the likes of Raja Hindustani, Dhoom-2/Dhoom-3, Dabangg, Ek Tha Tiger, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Chennai Express etc. These films cannot be named in the same breath as the likes of Mother India, Mughal-E-Azam, Sholay, HAHK, DDLJ, Gadar, 3 Idiots and now perhaps PK. The collections of these films are not only historic, they're benchmarks in themselves and the sort of collections which have changed business dynamics of Bollywood films altogether. You're welcome to refer to the following list of the biggest bollywood hits till date to get a clearer picture :http://bollywoodboxofficedata.blogspot.in/2014/07/all-time-hits-1940-49-1.html@Anup : Refer to the following list of the biggest bollywood hits down the years with their collections to get a clearer picture of what i mean :http://bollywoodboxofficedata.blogspot.in/2014/07/all-time-hits-1940-49-1.html@Divya: from an innocent childlike observer's point of view nothing illegal or immoral was even hinted a in the film. So I cannot understand what's wrong? As regards Jaggu getting dumped, it's the director who decided on that lame story and showing Jaggu as a stupid idiot.  Even I immediately commented to my daughter that the letter is not signed and how does Jaggu know that the letter is meant for her because the messenger didn't even verify her name before giving the letter. So one more reason to show you how lame the story was.BTW nitice hiw the Anujs and Anups are ranting about numbers but carefully avoiding discussing the contents.  Aur karenge bhi kaise? Bada baba ji ka thullu de gaye godmen RH aur AK.@Fan- Dont want to discuss with an alien who find only thing in the movie is Aamir Khan pieing on the wrong place,,,,i guess according to ur thinking the movie MUNNA BHAI MBBS must have been giving the msg of passing MBBS exam through cheating using cellphone..Salute to ur intelligence and sense of humor..    Doesn't matter an irrelevant single person called FAN what thinks,,the whole India has accepted the movie,,even getting overwhelming response from overseas market..CANT U SEE THAT !! OHH M SORRY ,, HOW CAN U ,, U MUST HAVE BEEN ON SOME OTHER PLANET AS U R NOT FROM EARTH..My apology.."As regards Jaggu getting dumped, it's the director who decided on that lame story and showing Jaggu as a stupid idiot. Even I immediately commented to my daughter that the letter is not signed and how does Jaggu know that the letter is meant for her because the messenger didn't even verify her name before giving the letter. So one more reason to show you how lame the story was" ~ even I wondered after watching Sholay why a respected cop would hire 2 untrustworthy small time crooks to catch a dreaded dacoit. I wondered after watching DDLJ why 2 NRI's would start indulging in mushy romance in the middle of nowhere. I wondered after watching Lagaan how exactly did a team of rookies who never knew how to play the game 3 months ago ended up beating a tem of veterans. I wondered after watching Interstellar why the protagonist would abandon his quite,peaceful life as a farmer and go away from his family to never see them again. I wondered after watching Godfather why Al Pacino came back to take over family business for no real reason. I wonder after watching A Wednesday how an entire police force would go nuts after a guy whose claims and identity was not even verified. I wondered after watching 3 Idiots how someone could have impersonated admission in a leading engineering college. In fact, sometime I wonder why films are even made! Movies are just a silly form of illogical fantasy meant to entertain "dumb" people who admire films like PK, Queen, Chak De India and Kaminey. For the super smart one's we always have flawless masterclasses like All The Best and Chennai Express which have no flaws whatsoever and have a logic behind every scene and frame of theirs'So this guy has a problem with Vishal Bharadwaj, he thinks Anurag Kashyap is a disgrace, he calls Queen a poor film,Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is a snoozefest he calls Aamir Khan a master of deception, he calls Raju Hirani films as substandard. In short, everyone in the industry barring Rohit Shetty and a handful of other actors of a certain religious clan like Hrithik Roshan & Ajay Devgan is a buffoon who're incapable of performing on the big screen. I won't be surprised if after Mohenjo-Daro he comes up with a statement "HR is labored and a hammer while AG is a master of snoozefests".@Anuj @Anup: other than useless criticism and analogies with other irrelevant subjects you have been avoiding discussing the contents of the film.  Still waiting for clarification on your own statement as to why is it a problem that human beings have a religion and to keep the discussion PK centred where did your godmen RH and AK establish the link between religion and whatever arguments you would give to support your statement. Aise idhar udhar ki baaton par bhatakna chhod do, it's a sign of a weak mind and idiotic blabbery.@Fan: There are 4 people on this forum who have explained the analogy of this film as they witness it in clear and concise terms. Of course, your self obsession and pre meditated mindset of panning this films-come what may makes you blind enough to either accept their theories or reject them using your own idiotic and mindless conclusions. Repeating the "discuss on the film's content" statement like a parrot in every comment of your's ain't gonna change the fact that there are millions across the globe who have loved this film for what it is and that your tastes have been going to the dogs of late. Every member on this forum has already expressed their views on the film in simple and understandable language. I don't think u should expect anyone to keep repeating the same statements over & over again (like you've been doing ever since the movie released).@Fan Ok dude what's your problem with the film's content????In the film,a muslim group bombed a train because Pk had supposedly insulted their god and in real life a Hindu group attacked theatres showing PK because it supposedly insulted their gods.So now do you see the problems with religion and why the film addressed them?????@Fan.. the movie did not say - don't have faith in God. It just says don't have faith in godmen who make rules for you. Believe in your own god, not the god made by these godmen. The Jaggu betrayal was not about a Pakistani, it was a simple example how you can ruin your life by having blind faith in Godmen. In normal circumstances Jaggu would have questioned the letter like you did but Godman words regarding betrayal stuck to her mind. This did not let her think rationally. ....Peace....@Fan- Seriously man !! u don't even know how many problem this planet suffer due to different religions . Forget about rest of the planet our own country suffers so many problems in the name of Religion , and u r not even aware of that....U know i was just joking by calling u alien but u r proving again and again that u doesn't belong to this planet..My top 3 films of 2014 : 1. Queen/PK - Hard to choose2. Mary Kom3. MardaaniUnfortunately there have been no "excellent" films i've seen this year. Even the best one's like Queen and PK have been a good & solid 3.5/5 but not exactly what i term as "excellent" or outstanding. Ditto for Mary Kom & Mardaani. Its a pale comparison to what happened in 2013 where I could count at least 5-6 good,solid entertainers (not excellent by any means) like Special 26, Jolly LLB, Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, Madras Cafe & Kai Po Che.@Pragya: thanks finally for a decent objective reply to my questions. About not having faith in god and religion being a problem: just for the records those were Anuj's point of views which I was questioning and challenging. For other matters will get back soon as I have got to do some other urgent stuff.@Pragya: thanks finally for a decent objective reply to my questions. About not having faith in god and religion being a problem: just for the records those were Anuj's point of views which I was questioning and challenging. For other matters will get back soon as I have got to do some other urgent stuff.Thankfully the vandalizing has not discouraged the audiences from watching this wonderful film. 9.5 cr on second Monday, 9 cr on second Tuesday, 90 cr expected in week 2. The sort of records that will stand the test of time in the years to come.@Pragya: blind faith in ANYBODY is not good.  Case in hand: the hooligans monopolizing this page in the blind worship of godmen RH and AK. Anyways,  staying focused: the whole point about my efforts is to evaluate the film on its merits, what it actually showed. It should not be evaluated on what it had WANTED TO SHOW. Just as a student who knows his maths theory very well,  and his manner of answering the exam question shows clearly that his principles are sound. But in his hurry or overconfidence makes a calculation error and gives a wrong answer.  And he  gets a low score  if not a zero for that question. The film, purely on what's produced on celluloid is an average fare. The link between what are dangers of extreme religious views is not established.  The evils of godmen (although vast majority of your family gurudev are a harmless species - separate post hereunder) are not even superficially scratched, the nexus of religion and terrorism and politics was not even thought of remotely.  So, intentions apart what is produced and shown is a shoddily and hastily put together haphazard jokes that are available a dime a dozen by doing a simple Google.  Intention shouldn't be the yardstick but the output should be.  Subjective evaluation shouldn't be the norm, objective evaluation must be the rule.@Fan... This topic of religion-social-political nexus is very vast. This film is about an outsiders' perspective about our (humans on earth) relationship with God. Its about how this is overwhelming and confusing for a person who does not belong here. I think it was successful in giving an overall picture and establishing the faith confusion. If it would have tried to touch upon more, still it would not satisfy many of us. We would ask why only Hinduism and Islam, talk about all religions...why terrorism in India, other geographic regions have different socio-political, religion, culture issues. The movie did what could be touched upon in 2plus hours. For more..lets see what's in Ranbir Kapoor's agenda :)"how you can ruin your life by having blind faith in Godmen"Judging entirely on what's shown on celluloid and not on what somebody must have intended - the godman concerned did not even manipulate by an iota the situation. During the interval I had already battled with and eliminated the theory that the godman must have arranged to have the letter sent so that his credibility stays intact. But I quickly eliminated that theory as I didn't associate such extremely poor writing with Hirani.  As it turns out the baba had not even manipulated that situation.  So how could he be held responsible for the error made by Jaggu. If she'd have spoken with her Indian friends than a majority would have given the same advice as the baba. Whole point is that the writing and execution of the film is below par.Getting out of celluloid reality and talking about intentions that seems to be giving divine pleasure to a few on this page - almost every Indian family regardless of religion has a spiritual head to whom they give reverence.  To avoid generalizing like godmen RH and AK I will speak about myself and my close relatives.  When we come in contact with a spiritual subject matter expert we take advantage of that opportunity to understand religious beliefs and traditions. We indulge in a healthy debate.  And invariably I realise that the belief under question had a scientific basis when it was put in practice.  Some may still have the same valid basis today and some may not. Sometimes the message coming is not convincing but me and my relatives have sufficient common sense to separate the correct and less correct and not get influenced by blind following.  Now, I suppose that if I have that much common srnse then the same should be true of other people on this page.  So what's this big deal about ruining once life under influence of a gurudev? And suddenly some one will say yes it's probably true for us but not for the masses. Ha my friends that's where you err in thinking that only you are rational and everybody elsr out there is a dumb sucker who'd fall like a block of iron in ocean for such influencing.  NO. Everybody has sufficient common sense to understand what's happening.  Thus, even out of reel and celluloid the intended objective does not stand. The film remains technically a below par product.And Anuj: I'll be back soon for one last time on .pk to slap your incessant rantings on earnings to assume it's a good film.Quantity is not equal to quality. And vice versa. Apne godmen RH aur AK se jakar influence lene ki koshish kar lo tabtak.@Fan Arrey Bhai Kehna kyaa chahte ho?????@Gokul: movie as shown on celluloid is below par. It's trying to give a solution to a problem that doesn't exist.  And finally to generalize that every baba and gurudev are to be ignored as fraudsters is equally untrue and immature as generalizing  that every Muslim must be eliminated because they are terrorists. I don't agree with both generalisations but clearly I am so far the only vocal person here disagreeing with both generalisations.Wrong message and even worse execution.  If only blind irrational followers of godmen RH and AK would get out of self hypnotism and start using brains then you would be able to call a spade a spade.For some here the fact that a movie earns more than 200 crores Rs @ the rate of 150 Rs per ticket average price is a sign of higher footfalls and thus global approval.  Right Anuj?Couple to that the fact that a film continues to earn money beyond first weekend, in the case of .pk for 4 consecutive weeks, means a major positive word of mouth.  And whoever says positive says  approval.  Right Anuj?And to top it, if people pay for a second viewing (what the heck it's new year - let me be generous and say 3rd viewing) then that's proof enough that film is good and public acceptance of the message of the film is phenomenal and positive.  Right Anuj?Well .pk message as i gathered from a few replies is that godmen are villains.  Let's look at godmen.They earn multiple times 200 crores pa with free entries for all. As per your illogical reasoning this is a sign of higher footfalls and thus global approval.Couple to that the fact gurudevs earn money 52 weeks a year (13 times longer duration than .pk), means a major positive word of mouth.  And whoever says positive says  approval.And to top it, forget 2nd viewing their audience goes for scores of time repeat viewing. Lo: proof enough that gurudevs are good and public acceptance of the gurudev's message is phenomenal and positive.But how is that possible?If .pk earns more than 200 crores, has good business over 3 weeks, people having repeat viewing then it's message is correct and universally accepted by all then by extension of same (il)logical reasoning the babas who earn multiple times more than .pk and which more footfalls than .pk 52 weeks a year and who generate at least 20 times more repeat viewing than .pk must have a multiple times positive effect than .pk and must be even more correct in message than .pkWhat a paradox due to your illogical reasoning of equating quantity to quality.!!!Let's hope that the immature young people populating this site grows up.  I rest my case of evaluating the film purely on what was shown (and not what was intended to be shown).  For all who want to continue their absurd defence of the film you are welcome to do it here or on a plethora of other websites on domain name .pkAu revoir from me on this discussion. Rendezvous on some other film's discussion.@fan Dude the problem of religion exists everywhere and all babas and godmen are fake and fraud.PK New Year on this page,  one i have to congratulate Team PK for their achievement @ theticket window, lets face the issues dealt by PK, do they have universal appeal perhaps no butit gives hope that films marketed on a large scale and thriving on content are still winners. My question is this guys protesting are they genuine? answer i guess is no, i think this is motivated by persons who cannot stomach 300 cr net collections in India, how come protests started after it had crossed the 225 cr mark ie > Kick and Chennai Express, this may even be a calculated attempt by some film makers to show their envy of the 3 gurus (not idiots)ie VVC, RH,& AKLol the next film from Hirani is a satire on bakwas blockbusters like Dabangg, CE, Bodyguard, ETT, Dhoom 3. Now get ready for 500 cr club with Raju And Ranbir.Looking at this mega collections i guess Baby and OMG sequel will underperform at box office.Yes indeed a film running to 70% occupancy and carrying 90% word of mouth and breaking records into week 2 and week 3 and god alone knows how many more weeks is a sign of positive word of mouth. Idiots with an IQ level who enjoy films like Chennai Express would obviously not get this. The hypocrisy of this coward is that when an Anurag Kashyap makes a film he never speaks of things like "quality" and always yaps on box office to justify that a majority of the audience does not wanna watch an Anurag Kashyap film. Now that he himself has proved out to be an odd one out in a film which is being admired by 90% of the audience watching it, he's getting into the quality debate, which factually is always a personal choice be it a Sajid Khan film or a Steven Spielberg film. Mr. Fan, whoever the hell u are, i'm not gonna bother wasting more time on your pea sized brains. Accept the fact that PK is the best trending big budget film in recent times with a word of mouth of 90% and you unfortunately are a depressed, worthless and pointless movie viewer who does not seem to admire any brand of cinema apart from your Rohit Shetty and Manmohan Desai nonsense. As for the movie PK itself, it is an apt satire on the religious fiends of a nation which witnesses religious riots and intolerence (latest example being the unnecessary protests against the film) on almost a weekly basis. As for godmen, you might be a big fan of theirs, but frankly, ALL of them are not only unnecessary, most of them end up being fraudulent too. Now keep ranting, shitting, vomiting and whining on this forum as your dislike will not change the fact about how much PK is being loved by the classes and masses alike, be it single screen audiences of Mohali or the multiplex audiences of Mumbai or the Nri's of Manhattan.@Ehinome : On the one hand you have protests from a particular faction but you also have a political stalward from the same faction calling it a "bold and courageous" film. Not to forget it going tax free in UP now. Pk has ended up being more then just a film. Its a lethal cocktail of entertainment & religious satire which was bound to work in any environment and among any audience, least of all in a politically charged environment that prevails in this nation. Even the biggest of optimists and Hirani fans like myself would never have imagined that this movie would actually go on to become the cult it has ended up being!Bhai logon hamare @Fan bhai actually ye kehna chahte hei ki our so called gurus and god men ko wo bhi follow karte hein..And he is too mature for us somewhat like u can imagine JAGGU'S father in the movie.....So @Fan like godmen and movie says godmen are bad..so if godmen are not a problem for @Fan then they are not at all a problem..As he said movie has tried to show a problem which is not actually a [email protected] bhai lagta hei tmhe ye lagta hei ki duniya tmse hi chal rahi hei....Khair movie dekh kar tmhari kitni jalli hogi ye mein samajh sakta hoon....I feel sry for u....As for the ticket prices, even CE,D3,K3,HNY,BB and Kick has the same average ticket prices as PK. Yet PK will overtake every one of these films by a huge margin of 100-150 crs. None of these films registered 60-70% occupancies after 14 days of release. The last time such historic numbers of all time proportions were achieved in the multiplex era was when 3 Idiots released 5 years ago!Week 1 -  171.2 cr  Week 2 - 93.6 cr  Total  - 264.8 cr  Dhoom 3 (Hindi) collection record shattered.  Aamir and Raju pls stop raping box office lest the others file FIR for humiliating records.  My most sincere thanks to all those who have said yes to entertaining and meaningful cinema.  I have my own issues with Aamir but dis time only Congrats from me. Peace all.1st 100 cr grosser : Ghajini1st 150 cr grosser : 3 Idiots1st 200 cr grosser : 3 Idiots1st 250 cr grosser : Dhoom 31st 300 cr grosser : PKAamir Khan has definitely proved himself to be the undisputed king of the multiplex era and a complete box office game-changer. Nobody, not even his most die hard fans would ever have imagined that a guy who had extremely limited and fragmented popularity up until the turn of the millennium would actually manage to achieve such a historic and unbelievable turn around in his career graph.Amazing movie, Amir khan once again proved that nothing is impossible, with a weird look in the whole film Aamir did justice with the character and its full of entertainment, a refreshing movie. . .@ Meetu, your review is so much similar to what I thought about the movie. Positives - 1) What worked for me the most is that PK was PK and not Aamir Khan. 2) Anushka Sharma. Too cute. 3)  Saurabh Shukla, Boman Irani, Parikshit Sahni keep the film on its mark without attracting too much attention towards them. 4) No caricaturing of Tapasvi Maharaj 5) Touching a sensitive, but important topic. 6)  I would applaud it for finding the balance and not defying the existence of a supreme power.Negatives - 1) Jokes are on the lame side. You say that the point made is powerful, but I don't think so. For me, it was too simplistic. 2) We would make the same arguments in a coffee table conversation. 3) Nothing great about technical aspects of film making.  But in the end you formed a very different opinion about the rating. I would give it a 'So-So' only. I can't recommend it to anyone even for a single watch. Major reason for this being, there was nothing great about the movie. As you said, it really over simplified a very complex topic. I don't think that any of the writers has ever really delved deep into into faith, religion or spiritualism. Before I go further, I would like to declare that I am an atheist since my childhood. But as I am growing, I have developed a lot of respect for spiritualism and religions, especially Hinduism.  Actually, movie could just scratch the surface of a very powerful topic. I would prefer OMG over this.   There is one instance in the movie when Tapasvi tells a man, whose wife is paralysed, to go on a spiritual journey to some Himalayan mountain. And this was outrightly rejected by our protagonist, without really going into the debate. In my opinion, it could have been a very good suggestion. This is because, since she was terminally ill, why not take her to a calm place like the Himalayas so that she can take her last breath in peace (considering that it was possible to take her there without hurting her too much physically).  If I was in that lady's place, I would have actually told my loved ones to do the same. If you guys really think about it, most of the Hindu temples are on the mountains, and higher the mountain, higher is the sacredness. Reason is very simple, whoever constructed those temples were very intelligent and mature people. They got inner peace when they got to those mountains, and wanted everyone to come up there and experience the same feelings. Some other people would have followed them thereafter, and slowly and slowly those places became places of worship. In my opinion, those places are really worthy of worship, but not so much now when there's so much crowd up there. Instead of peace, you get chaos. Also, one question, how many of our parents would ever go to such magnificent places like Amarnath cave, Sabarimala temple, Vaishno Devi temple, if they were not declared as shrines. I feel very few. These places are really awesome, where you can really get inner peace and forget about the pressures of your daily life, but for the chaos because of ever increasing crowd. So, for me, I would rather go to some secluded mountain, where you have to take permission from Forest department, to find my God. And coming to Godmen, they are just like psychiatrists. I am not talking about the Asarams of the world, but real spiritual guides.  They can really do the healing. Although, I have not experienced it myself, I have come to feel so.  Even tantriks, I feel, are a different kind of psychiatrists. There are so many points which I can tell, which have contributed towards my respect for Hinduism. But the problem comes when people believe that religion and God are something that can do some magic and help them. And there are people are out there who just want to make money, out of this belief. Actually I have some respect also for Asarams and all, because they are running their businesses so well. If people want to pay money to get fooled, then I would say that the person who can make them do so is a really good businessman. He is just selling his product, it is for the people to decide, whether it is worthy or not. Demand and supply – simple business funda. So in all, I am really disappointed with PK. There’s nothing deep in the movie, it is actually for kids only.If any of you guys haven’t seen ‘Man from earth’, please do watch it. It is a much more mature film on a similar topic, 90% of which is shot in a single room. The debate in that movie is so engrossing, that you will forget about your popcorn or anything.@Kapil: totally empathise with your views.  Only blind followers are lapping up the prasad without the slightest of reflection.I wanted some counter views, but I am so late in posting my comment :(Meetu, Anuj, Anup, Fan, ehinome okojie, Gokul - anyone out there? Please do comment.@Kapil: I couldn't agree more with you (just scroll up to see for yourself). As regards counter views there are none,  I already asked several times.  With the exception of Priya all the others are either silent or on a character assassination trip like if you don't realise how great this film is then you're a moron. Not that I get perturbed. Such attacks are very reassuring because it means that the others have no factual arguments to show why the film is good.  Othrr than thay it earned 300 crores without realising that by their own claims the babas earn several times more than 300 crores and so several times better than pk."Only blind followers are lapping up the prasad without the slightest of reflection." ~unfortunately for the cynics, the number of blind followers seem to be too huge in number in this instance. Especially when there are cynics who just like reading their own words and hearing their own voice which keeps repeating the same old statement like a parrot taught to repeat the same line every morning.Make a satire on Mohammed and get killed.Make a satire on Hindu gods and get 300 crores.Only Indians can be so gullible.With regards 3 crore guys who wasted their money and are ashamed to admit that they got duped, well they deserved to get duped.@Kapil and @Fan i just watched the film and thought about it why there is such hue and cry over a film.firstly the about the business you like it or not but it is true that the film is huge hit and also it is appreciated not immensely but good.As far as film goes about it is never says that you should not believe in God or religion what it says believe and have faith but not blind faith and there lies the thin line.There are sequences in film which might not say all but they clearly suggest that we as species are in danger because of blind faith.An essay can be written on it and then too it will not be sufficient.A film made in India will tend to show Hinduism more and at least my religion is not that weak that a film will destroy it but what a film says is to introspect.Even is USA there are films which are controversial Dogma for eg even The Da Vince code and Angels and demons."With regards 3 crore guys who wasted their money and are ashamed to admit that they got duped, well they deserved to get duped." ~ do u even know the meaning of getting duped? 90% of the 3 cr people who watched PK at the theaters (countless more via illegal online downloads) gave it a unanimous thumbs up! That's not what u call getting duped/cheated. Its only those 10% of the losers who booked their seats first day and then have been crying out loud on online forums about how their sentiments have been hurt who're feeling duped. And yes, you tasteless movie watchers do deserve to get duped, not once but multiple times over, be it when a CDI releases or a Queen or a 3 Idiots or a PK and now the upcoming Baby. "Make a satire on Mohammed and get killed.Make a satire on Hindu gods and get 300 crores.Only Indians can be so gullible." ~ ever heard of Da Vinci Code? If you're so gullible and feel so offended then i request you to take a gun a your hand and start firing at random folk who're still buying tickets for PK even in its 4th week running. Good luck!No one is ashamed of liking PK nor is anyone complaining of getting duped. Except for the [comment partially deleted for personal attack] who're trying to justify their bogus opinions as the opinions of the majority despite jolly well knowing that they're playing a lost game.@Fan, it seems that we are on the same side wrt PK. There's really nothing substantial in the movie. But I didn't like this line of yours "Make a satire on Mohammed and get killed.Make a satire on Hindu gods and get 300 crores".If you are a real Hindu, then please respect your religion and its teachings. Hinduism is really the most tolerant of all. It doesn't mean that we are weak. PK made 300 crores because it was liked by a majority of people. Which means that these many people are really not satisfied by what they had been believing for so many years, and this movie represents a different point of view for them. But for people like me (and you also), who have always questioned about the existence of God and idol worship, it is nothing new. Actually, this movie is like what I was in my early teens...almost totally against any religious activity. But now I am in my mid twenties, and have grown up from that rebellious stage. Now I try to find rationale behind any belief, rather than making mockery of it. When people say that God is up there, I really like to tell them that yes, it is indeed up there, but not too high, it is in our minds only. Real God is our Mind only. It can really do wonders.@Siddharth, may be this movie fits the bill for a majority of Indians. I don't deny it. And I am really glad that it is such a super duper hit. But for me, I have already passed this PK stage. It seemed too childish.@Anuj, you talk about Da Vinci Code. Another mediocre movie. Please watch 'Man from Earth', then talk about it and PK. That movie will certainly make you use your grey matter. It will force you to think.@Kapil : I do know that Da Vinci Code is a below average movie. My comment is wrt to needless and senseless backlash PK has been facing from certain factions. As for PK, its is the best movie of the year imo and for millions of Bollywood viewers across the world as well. No 2 ways about that!It's amazing it has crossed neither any commenter's mind nor that of the reviewer's mind to mention that Khan was trying to mimic Mr.Bean to a T only to do a bad job of it as usual and you call this guy perfectionist. Perfectionist or not, he surely is a perfect copy cat like he unequivocally proved  in his Ghajini(although many tried to make him acknowledge it on Twitter by reminding him of Memento, alas,this guy wouldn't budge). Even a cursory look at Khan's facial makeup and that bumbling walk of Bean Khan imitated in PK confirms that the character is a poor copy of Bean but apparently not to the reviewer and the numerous khan's admirers here. This movie made 500 crore without a single mention of Atkinson anywhere. So much for India and its famous perfectionists....So much for some hollywood fanboys that they wanna equate every act of every Indian actor to a hollywood actor and call Indian film-makers as wannabe and imperfect. Mr. Bean and Khan's character in PK have little resemblance barring the manner of walk and if that's what you call a "copy", i'm afraid 90% of the nonsense that Hollywood produces is either a Korean, Italian or a Japanese rip off. There elite Indian Nri's are the same breed who call Mr Bachchan in Agneepath a "copy" of Pacino despite there being hardly any resemblance barring the mother-son relationship angle. But of course anything done by the white skinned man automatically becomes superiour in their laughable opinions while an Indian legend being accepted and acclaimed the world over become "copycats" in their eyes, all thanks to their colonial hangover and slave mindsets of running after the dollars and pounds of the world. Factually, these Nri's and the wannabe's fall in the "neither here nor there" category of audiences. Not that much is expected out of them anyway!Tasteless or not, these pseudo intellectual worthless Nri's and urban multiplex Hollywood fanboys do have the knack of making bizzare and ridiculous links and equations with the sole intention of degrading anything and everything that an Indian film maker does thereby proving their everlasting and undying loyalty to anything coming out of the western world. Wonder when did the ugly and boring Mr. Bean become an alien and learn to speak perfect bhojpuri!@Anuj You said "...little resemblance barring the manner of walk....". Well, U should have added 'barring the eyes,barring the ears, barring the expressions' etc., etc. Yes, barring all those he is not Bean. For your information, the PK character was definitely Bean, barring Aamir Khan unless of course U r naturally born blind or blinded with admiration for Khan. By the way, you have also failed to explain where did Khan pick his 'manner of walk' in PK(Google 'PK copy of Bean', you will see stunning side by side comparison of Bean and PK). This copy cat, steeped in pseudo -artistic main stream Mumbai cinema obsessed with B-grade mimicry of B-grade western movies an Indian legend?????(Oh god, Don't I hate the word Bollywood??such a stuffy copy of Hollywood) are you in your right mind sir??? Whatever happened to Satyajit Ray or Aadoori Gopal Krishnan. May be they were swept away by the humongous drool spewed out of mouths of Khan's fans agape with admiration for Khan's evolution(or is it mutation??). No???... Khan may please first explain where did he get the idea for Ghajini(or for the antics of PK for that matter), then I will accept he is at least honest if not legggggenddddd.....Yeah bogus google articles created by pseudo intellectual western film admirers like yourself with the sole intention of spitting vomit online for no apparent reason! Minor resemblance to some character played by someone in some part of the world does make it a "rip off" as you Hollywood fanboys would make it seem. Mr. Bean never preached blind religious dogmatic beliefs nor can he speak bhojpouri! As for Ghajini, i do not remember Guy Pirce snarling and hissing like the way Sanjay Singhania did. As for the ideas and creative bit, these are not an actor's imperative. That is why we have directors, script writers and screenplay writers. An actor is supposed to act according to the directions of the man in the hot seat, Aamir Khan is no different. I'm sure any normal cinema viewer with a bit of grey matter in their heads knows this fact, except perhaps blind cynics who're looking for excuses to criticize someone's work at any cost, come what may! And don't get into Satyajit Ray to hide your predjudice like most of u Hollywood fanboys do! I've watched more of Indian cinema than you hypocrites have, that i'm sure of!@Prasanna - let me tell u why Aamir is called a perfectionist . First of all there is a difference between Remake and Copy , Gajni was a remake with the same team making the movie again by changing the actors to reach wider audience . Don't know whether you know this or not but after watching Gajni   Surya the lead actor of south indian Gajni have said in an interview that he was so much overwhelmed  watching Aamir doing such a brilliant job which he couldn't do. That's what perfection means , even when he was doing a character which already have been done ,, he does it in such a way that even the original Salutes it..And for your Hollywood-Bollywood discussion , there is no movie industry in this world which doesn't make copies and remake , not even Hollywood.QSQT, JJWS, AAA, Rangeela, Sarfarosh, Lagaan, DCH, RDB, TZP, 3 Idiots, PK among others is the filmography of a perfectionist to say the least. Especially when equated with the kinda films his contemporaries have been doing over the years!@Anuj writes: do u even know the meaning of getting duped? 90% of the 3 cr people who watched PK at the theaters (countless more via illegal online downloads) gave it a unanimous thumbs up! That's not what u call getting duped/cheated.And the same Anup calls the several more crores who believe in god, and who believe in good satsang as idiots being duped by godmen.I let the readers find the stupidity in the illogical arguments of one Anuj.As regards killing people for watching a film - I am not from that genre.  Nor am I in favour of ban.  Every movie, as with every expression, has a right to be displayed.  I am just making an evaluation of the what was dished out to viewers.  Purely based on what was shown, and what the illogical fans are unable to even explain or defend, I am saying that the movie is so-so.  3 crores saw it - fine.  They are ashamed to cry the king is naked - fine.  But do not insult a religion because you want to blindly follow your godmen RH and AK.@Kapil: What I wrote is completely factual.  Only the Indian so-called liberals allow such trash against their culture without blinking an intelligent eye or thought on what exactly is being said or criticised.  I am proud of Indian culture that is open to evolution but at the same time I am ashamed of so called liberals who criticise beliefs and traditions without even spending five minutes to understand it's origin and to find out if there is some basis to the belief or not.@Sidhharth: once again, I am not against or in favour of anything for Hinduism.  I am evaluating the film on what is shown.  Also I expect such films to have done their research on why a certain tradition before making fun of it.And like Kejriwal everybody can point out problems.  What is smart is to show solutions.  And there the film was completely silent.  They themselves had created the opportunity when the godman says that if our way of doing is a "wrong number" then please tell us what is the right number.  And nothing was done or said.Every field, be it religion, IT, pharma, auto, health-care, etc. will have their consultants.  Some or good and some are less good.  Generalizing and saying that believing in godmen is blind faith is way too off the mark.  It's like saying every film reviewer is an idiot (even though Anuj would agree with it).  Senior citizens get some timepass in the autumn of their lives by listening to such gurus.  Most of them hardly ever speak evil of other religions (unlike what was shown in the film), most of them are soft spoken and polite, and most of the time their gyan is as innocent as the 100s of whatsapp messages on moral science that you and me receive each day.  So what's the harm?Basically the film was hijacked by AK who in his mind believes himself to be a perfectionist.  If they would have put 5 people around a table, for a few hours to discuss and come up with some relevant and hard hitting episodes around religion then they would have made an excellent film (content wise).  Otherwise this is just another film where hard-core fans blindly go to watch the film and then praise it without digesting much of what was shown.  That is also a kind of blind faith.  And as per your own statement ALL kinds of blind faith is bad - including blind faith in godmen RH and AK.@Anuj enlightens us that QSQT, JJWS, AAA, Rangeela, Sarfarosh, Lagaan, DCH, RDB, TZP, 3 Idiots, PK among others is the filmography of a perfectionist to say the least. Especially when equated with the kinda films his contemporaries have been doing over the years!Yes, his ratio of good films is certainly on the higher side.  But that does not mean that he is untouchable and that he cannot give a dud.  One doesn't have to think far back to discover a certain film called Mangal Pandey which failed miserably.  Dhoom 3 and PK too in that range - where commercial earnings are piped up by blind followers but content is so-so.Blind faith in the capability of godman AK to deliver a hit is irrational.@Fan: Rant all u want, it wouldn't change the fact that your taste is as pathetic and senseless as your comments. Not that i expect much from chaps who idolize film-makers like Manmohan Desai and Rohit Shetty. Only they would ever equate a global record smashing blockbuster like PK with a Mangal Pandey! And btw, Mangal Pandey was anyday better than any film ever made by your favorite film-maker Rohit Shetty. So ya, shove your ridiculous opinions up your *** coz neither am i nor is anyone else interested in hearing your whining and wanking anymore. Stick to your Tevar's and CE's coz that's what your taste and IQ is worth.@Fan : And if your pea sized brain is willing to believe that 90% of the folk who loved PK are dimwits who got duped and the 10% of which you are a part are the only sensible cinema watchers left in this nation, then either you're just a boastful bragger or you need a reality check! I'm sorry, but just 'coz your taste sucks and you didn't personally fancy PK does not mean that you're gonna shove your filth up mine or anyone else's mind and expect us to accept your garbage. I'm sure some self obsessed tasteless individual such as yourself has plenty of yes-men in his own inner circle who'd be willing to pay heed to your garbage. This forum as well as PK are anyways done and dusted and the film has lived up to everyone's expectation apart from a few whining losers who got zero taste or knowledge of cinema.There is no point trying to bring down Rohit Shetty, at least he is a determined guy trying to entertain various classes of audience, he is doing a good job unlike some directors who go about stamping bums and using fucker every 15 minutes in order to get awards and critical acclaim, Chennai Express was a coming of age film for him, if you doubt this imagine CE faring better than Dhoom 3 and Krrish 3 on imdb, so leave the chap alone.  For your info Baby will wrap up under 125 cr just like MNIK did < 75 cr in 2010.Saw the filmfare nomination list for best actor  Race is stictly between Aamir Khan (PK) and Shahid Kapoor (Haider), Akshay Kumar (Holiday) has an outside chance as his film is the most patriotic.  Hrithik Roshan (Bang Bang) and Randeep Hooda (Rang Rasiya) make up the numbers. I do think Hooda's presence in KICK was helpful in getting this nomination.If not for Golmaal (2006) and Singham (2011), one of them being a frame by frame remake, Rohit Shetty would have been an extinct specie by now. Of course your statement on CE speaks of your dedicated and undying devotion to SRK's histrionics like most of his blind followers across the globe who're ready to watch him stammer and shiver his way through film after film. CE's rating on imdb is only another re-iteration of his blind, fanatical fan following much like Salman's box office performance with bogus films like ETT,Bodyguard and Kick. Aamir Khan and Hrithik Roshan have been the only mainstream commercial actors of late who have delivered even while experimenting with their roles as proved by JA,ZNMD,TZP,RDB,3I and now PK. Srk's experimentation has never worked barring Chak De India while Salman is incapable of mixing it up. As for Baby, it would wrap up under 120 of course, just like Holiday did but the important point is that the film will trend well and be accepted by the handful of audiences watching it. 120 is enough for it to become a HIT anyway!@Anuj: Maths and logic seem your weak point.3 crores believe that they liked .pk and are against godmen.15 crore or more believe in godmen.  As your maths is weak I will work it out for you:more than 80% of Indian population believe in godmen.  And less than 20% "think" they believe against.  And as logic is also your weak point, 20 is much less than 80.  So likers of .pk are much less that the believers in god.So stop harping and trolling on godmen RH and AK.  With all the saliva that has drooled from your mouth, you need a change of clothes.@Anuj: Maths and logic seem your weak point.3 crores believe that they liked .pk and are against godmen.15 crore or more believe in godmen.

With all the saliva that has drooled from your mouth, you need a change of clothes.@Fan Dude are you one of those 'godmen' because you are speaking like one.Making facts out of thin air and all.80%??????Really??????From all the above comments, one can easily say that this Fan is a Hindu fanatic who did not get or understand the concept of the movie. Kapil seems to be more logical in his comments.  How can someone say "Make a movie on Muhammad (pbuh)"  This is a ridiculous comment. The movie showed the hypocrisy of the hindu godmen or asarams who fool the people by making  fake shrines or selling fake dreams.  See the scene in the college where PK creates an instant shrine! The movie asks the question - Why do you need these common men who have special sales or persuaion techniques with some religious knowlegde to reach God.  God is available to you directly through your own prayers.  Even Islam has such "godmen" where the followers seek their advise and fall at their feet and donate to their dargas generously.  But Islam strictly prohibits this act and even does not allow anyone to bow down and donate to even the prophet Muhammad (pbuh). My advise to the minorities who have disliked the movie and on top of that, hate the fact that the majority has immensely loved the movie is to relax and realise that none of your comments or views are shared by the majority who spent Rs 335 crores watching this movie.  Sorry Fan..."So likers of .pk are much less that the believers in god." ~ i guess IQ and maturity is your weak point. Neither does PK advocate disbelief in god nor does it preach atheism. There's a hell of a difference between believing in god and god'men' [comment deleted for personal attack]Note from administrator: Dear user, your comments might be blocked if there is repeated personal attacks even if the specific words used aren't the worst possible.Not 80, i would say 99% of India does believe in the concept of god. But if someone tells me that 80% of the lot believes in god-'men', i'd say they need to get their heads examined and i'd unfortunately feel a bit sorry for their future generations!Contrary to popular opinion RH played his game well 40% of these viewers are godmen fanatics, most of others are hollywood fanboys.Ask Perfectionist to release Baby during IPL, we will know his real pull,(c--ard) who could not release his film during post-IPL.Hollywood fanboys are sad that their stars could not get a foothold on Indian box office, so they went pursuing the producer of Oscar nominated Lagaan, they forgot that the body nominated Ashutosh Gowarika, this hypocritical audience could not make his films after Lagaan hits except Jodhaa Akbar which is a disputed hit, Now that AK is almost 50, they will turn to Ranbir Kapoor and Sushant Singh Rajput.I used to rate Amir highly as an actor till a few years back. And before that Salman and even SRK also. But you know, our sensibilities and taste change with age, as we get more experience/knowledge/awareness. Now I will never go to any Amir movie without checking out some reviews. How could that guy do Dhoom 3. In my opinion, Mahesh Bhatt is the most intellectual person in the Hindi film industry (among those who are famous). He has done everything. Saaransh, Arth, Zakhm, Janam etc are most of his most celebrated works, which he did before 90s. Some of those movies have won National Awards(only credible movie awards in the country) Then he realised that good cinema was not fetching him good money, because a large part of audience does not want to watch such movies. Either they don't have taste for such movies or majority of people want to watch out of the world storylines/dumb action sequences/dumb comedy/sex, but not sensible cinema. So, he started making movies which would sell, and not what he would love to make. And so came out Murder, Jism et al. But still I think most of his movies are equal or above the standards of 'watchable'. I liked Woh lamhe, Murder 2. So, what I am trying to say is that Mahesh Bhatt also thinks that Amir Khan is an over rated actor. But he had praise for his production house, for supporting low budget movies like Peepli Live, which are high on content. So people, get over your acting super stars - AK, SK, SRK, HR. None of these can guarantee a good movie, they are not worthy of our patronage. Rather worthy people whom we should follow are the directors. They are the real super stars. If you guys want to know a bit more about Mahesh Bhatt and Emraan Khan, please watch their Coffee with Karan episode. It is witty and in your face types. Only episode of Karan Johar's show, which I have watched, just because of Bhatt Sahab and Emraan Hashmi. It may also be scripted, but you do get to know more about the talented duo.@ehinome : If you have doubts about Raju Hirani's credentials or pull as a film-maker, you're either living in lala land or have lost the plot. Any director giving hits like 3 Idiots and PK in any season and with any release date has to be the most popular and patronized of his generation. The Munnabhai films didn't release in any season and had Sajay Dutt as the lead whose had a very mediocre career at best. Yet both were massive hits!@Kapil : Okay, so you didn't like PK! We got it. Dunno where Mahesh Bhatt came from considering that he's a master of rip off's and cheap thrills. As for Aamir, yeah he's still the best and PK is a very popular film...very very popular, mind u! As for cynics ranting about D3, it was Aamir's way of proving that if pungent horse $hit like CE,ETT and Kick can make the crores that they did, an Aamir horse $hit like D3 can strip them naked left,right and center. 275 cr in India, 170 cr overseas with a trash like D3...in your face!"Only episode of Karan Johar's show, which I have watched, just because of Bhatt Sahab and Emraan Hashmi. It may also be scripted, but you do get to know more about the talented duo." ~ okay, so u rate Murder,Awarapan,Jannat and Raaz ahead of 3I and Pk...great! Good luck, god bless ya!@KAPIL - its true that once there was a time when Mahesh Bhatt had given us good films , but not like he havent made movies like shit..Actually you havnt mentioned the bad movies of Bhatt like Ashique , Chahat , Duplicate - Atleast Dhoom 3 is better then these..And Mahesh Bhatt is nobody to say that Aamir is over rated actor . Aamir has always tried to show something different , doing less but good movies , always keep our expectations high. For that this actor need some respect. And whats the problem if an actor make one single movie like Dhoom 3 in between 3idiot , Talaash  and PK. Not a single A listed actor exist in Bollywood who doesnt do movie like Dhoom 3.And  where this over rated word came from. May be Aamir have done some average films but MAY I ASK YOU IN WHICH MOVIE HIS ACTING has been BAD.. !And for Bhatt production , its one of the worst production house in Bollywood , making money by skin show and hit songs, their movies even doesn't have a plot. They give one good movie out of 10 releases . And they say an actor is over rated who  give one average movie out of 5 releases. Come on..Mahesh Bhatt should raise his quality of work instead of saying who is under rated and who is over rated.And for your Kind information I have seen that episode of Koffee with Karan - Agar Mahesh Bhatt ka Bas chale to wo ye bhi bol de ki Emraan Hasmi is a better actor then Aamir khan. For proof u may see The episod of ANUPAM KHER SHOW with Mahesh Bhatt and Alia Bhatt where he cant stop himself  being praising his own daughter in the whole episode like there is no other newcomer who can tackle her daughter.@Meeta : This forum needs to be closed :P@Anuj Nope! The forum doesn't need to  be closed.@Meetu, haha. @Anup, I didn't mention his below average movies because I have not seen them. They seem like below average, but still I am sure that I won't feel like pulling my hair out while watching them. There is always some content in his movies. One more movie I now remember is Saaya, that was also a decent watch. Also, pls read what I posted - "Then he realised that good cinema was not fetching him good money, because a large part of audience does not want to watch such movies. Either they don't have taste for such movies or majority of people want to watch out of the world storylines/dumb action sequences/dumb comedy/sex, but not sensible cinema. So, he started making movies which would sell, and not what he would love to make." He is the one who has seen it all, done it all - from Saaransh to Murder, from content oriented to skin show. But none of his movies can be categorised as dumb, unlike Chennai Exress, Golmaal, No entry, Main hoon na, K3G, Housefull (of idiots) and so on. He was telling in that KJ's show that he makes sure that the kiss scene is there in the first half an hour of the movie, so that the audience gets satisfied and they would focus on the remaining movie. Mostly he uses skin show in movies' promos to attract masala movie lovers to the theatres, but actually in the movie you won't find much of that. For eg., Murder 2. People went to watch the movie for Jacqueline, but what they got was completely different. I guess they must have been pleasantly surprised in the end. And one more thing about his movies, as you yourself said, is hit songs. You know what, it takes a genius to come out with hit songs in almost all of his movies. Otherwise, who would want his movie to have flop songs, everyone strives for that, but very few have that knack or genius to identify quality.And yes, Emraan Hashmi is a better actor than Amir Khan. He's proved it in Shanghai. He may not have that A list actor appeal, but he's a better actor. He does not come with any mannerisms, it's all natural for him.Kapil- ofcoarse Bhatts have given us a lot of dumb movies more than Rohit Shetty has made in his whole life..Let me count for you - Aashique , Chahat , Duplicate , jism , Nazar , Raaz -2 , Inteha , Tum Mile , Blood Money , Jism2 (This one is the dumbest one both produced and written by mahesh bhatt ,) , Raaz 3 , murder 3..Kapil - And let me tell you this list is incomplete , there are many more dumb movies from 90s which i havent mentioned.As i said Bhatts give one better movie within every 10 releases.Kapil - And for your ' Emraan Hasmi is better then Amir Khan ' comment , plz dont say this same thing in public otherwise people will laugh at you. Take that as my suggestion.Just a performence in Shanghai and emraan hasmi became better then then Aamir Khan.Please take a close look on Emraan's movies, in each movie he uses same expression to convey his characters , he never offers anything different , its difficult to differentiate between his characters from different movies.Shaghai , Awarapan , Jannat and Ghanchakkar are the only exceptions where he shows some extra qualities of his acting capabilities"Emraan Hasmi is better then Amir Khan" ~ hmm...just like Rohit Sharma is a better batsman than Sachin courtesy his 264 in an ODI vs Sri Lanka last year! You are a unique specie indeed. The only ability of Hashmi which is better than any of the Khan's or Roshan or Devgan or Kumar or even Bachchan for that matter is his ability to snog a heroine's mouth off like a thirsty bear!@Anup, I have never been afraid to speak my mind anywhere. And many a times, I am the only one defending myself. Specially when I talk against Dhoni  and say that Dinesh Karthik is the best Wicket keeper/batsman in India, during daaru parties with my friends. But I love it. As for Mahesh Bhatt's movies which you are referring to as dumb, they may not be dumb in most probability. Dumb are movies like No entry, Golmaal, OSO, etc. I don't watch too many movies, only those which interest me. So I have never seen these movies of Bhatt sahab which you have mentioned, so can't really comment. But Rohit Shetty's movies are the defining movies of Bollywood. They define the scale of dumbness. This I can say from the few minutes of his movies which I am forced to see while sitting with some friends and the movie is playing on TV. As for Emraan Haashmi, he's improved a lot as an actor. And it depends on the director to bring out the best in him. He doesn't strive to be a superstar like the Khans. There's a difference between being a good actor and in choosing a good movie. Any good actor can choose a bad movie. @Anuj : Rohit Sharma is indeed a very good batsman. He's our only hope in the real cricketing pitches of WACA and MCG. Not comparing him to Sachin here. For me, Emraan Hashmi is better than any of the Khans or baby Roshan. I would compare him to Ajay Devgan and Akshay Kumar. But I used to be an AK fan, I have never said that he's a bad actor, just an over rated one.The so-called 'Baby' Roshan has delivered outside his home productions with films like Lakshya, Jodhaa Akbar, ZNMD, Agneepath etc but vulgar Hashmi has bombed outside uncle Bhatts' production house! Evident who the baby is in this case. And if u rate the mediocre Akshay Kumar as one of the best in the country, then i'm sorry but your taste is not in sync with mine...not one bit!Kapil - just in reply of your comment, it depends on director to bring out the best out of Emraan , thats not exactly the case with AK Z, as he give great performance in each and every movie doesnt matter who is the director and whether the  movie itself is good or bad. So i guess u can judge now who is better.And as u havent seem dumb movies of Bhutt camp then you should not blindly praise them.For Rohit shetty everybody knows he gives dumb movies , thats the reason i dont think AK will work with him everGuys! Just watch this - 'AIB - Knockout'. I literally died laughing. Never knew Karan Johar could be such a sport. He's gained my respect. Everyone of them - KJ, Alia (hats off to her), Ranbir, Arjun, Deepika. Simply amazing. AIB is the next big thing in showbiz.Talking of dumb directors who make dumb movies Karan Johar would be right on top of that list....Pk gets 1.18 cr in week 6 to post a total of 323.6 cr.@Meetu - this is the second or third time in a row where our bunch of American fans of Indian Movies agree pretty much completely with you! I'm sure this is a sign of  - something.... ;)I will say I felt the first half was a bit slow-going, though things really picked up after the Interval. (Most of the Indian movies we rent, buy or stream include "INTERVAL" or "INTERMISSION" points, so we can go to the bathroom, get more fruit or guacamole&chips;, or mix up more drinks. We've really come to rely on it....) I thought Anushka Sharma did a great job as a more gamine than she usually is character, and seeing Boman Irani as a aging, badly-burnt idealist getting his ideals back makes me think he's been bringing his "A" game to movies more lately, after a spate of films where he seemed to be coasting on a flamboyantly snarky comic style that made him seem like India's answer to Paul Lynde. Sure, Sanjay Dutt's Big-Hearted Goon is a role he could play in his sleep by now (thank the Gods he occasionally does a character like Ringmaster in Aladin!), but I did not see how his storyline ended coming - and how it would tie into the resolution of the plot. I think, as I thought with OMG, that this cleverly makes it points on Religion and Religious Intolerance (as you may know, we have our own kind right here in the US!), and wrapped it up in an entertaining fun package. I'd rate OMG a bit higher for its ending, but I recommend both to my friends who think Dogmatic Religious Conservatives are strictly an American phenomenon - and those who think we US people against Dogmatic Religious Conservatives "exaggerate" the issue....@TimELiebe oh yay! *happy dance* :DCopyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
