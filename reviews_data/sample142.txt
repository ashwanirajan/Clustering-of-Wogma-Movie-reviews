
wogma rating: Watch when on TV/online (?)
Promising premise. Interesting situations get repetitive, jokes unfunny and film bizarre.I don't know if it is funny, I watched it thrice and I could barely make out what was going on, beyond the basic plot. And, it doesn't look like I will find any of the loud, slapsticky comedy funny. However, there is hope because – Tere Bin Laden*. And there is trepidation  because – The Shaukeens.I'd be happy if Tere Bin Laden – Dead Or Alive hits it even between the two.

  What if a Osama look-alike is needed and found by both the US and some Mujahideen? Such an interesting premise for a story. And you have the intention to make it comical – a spoof on terrorism, war, international politics, film industries and more. As engaging as that sounds, Tere Bin Laden – Dead or Alive gets into repetitive situations and ends up making 110 minutes seem way longer than they are. From the beginning the movie is loud and doesn't try to mask the fact that it is aiming for slapstick. Even so, it is acceptable because the satire is amusing. Unfortunately, the well of satire has little water and dries up soon. What is left then is the ridiculous situation that our characters have found themselves in. Ridiculous doesn't always equal funny though. You could laugh at how silly all of it is. But, each of those laughs is wiped out by stretching the scene way longer than its viable life. The actors can only do so much. They are asked to be loud and loud they are. Of the lot, Pradhuman Singh stays as restrained as it can possibly be making his character quite adorable, as it is meant to be. Interestingly, Ali Zafar is annoyingly insuferable as he is meant to be too. Manish Paul overplays the comedy but again it is difficult to comment on his over-acting without blaming the writer-director. With little in the story beyond the basic premise, Tere Bin Laden Dead or Alive ends up just killing its potential to be lively. See, I am bored enough to do bad puns too.  Better stop here.

        ...If you must watch this film, watch it for Sikandar and Iman. If Sikandar’s poor visibility in Bollywood is due to a lack of trying, then it is his choice, but if it is due to a lack of roles, then the loss is totally ours. As for Iman…how I wish more Bollywood writers would write scripts that require the casting of an African American actor. He and Sikandar are a hoot and the only reason why Tere Bin Laden – Dead or Alive is not a complete write-off.

        ...Overall, where many might not feel thoroughly entertained sitting in the theater post buying a costly multiplex ticket, many might consider it entertaining enough while watching on a TV channel in the coming months without making any extra effort or expenditure. So do wait for the same and catch it later especially for Sikander Kher.

        ...Conclusion: Tere Bin Laden 2 could have become a good film, or even a great film but is content with just being a decent film. The idea which germinated in the director’s head was a really cool one but it doesn’t reach its zenith, like it should have. It is a missed opportunity because the humour quotient is lower than the first one and the subtle satire doesn’t come through very cleanly. If you’re content with your doses of humour in intervals, then this movie should be right up your alley.
