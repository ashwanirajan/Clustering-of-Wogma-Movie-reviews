
wogma rating: Watch if you have nothing better to do (?)
Rush is a crime drama that you've to struggle to keep awake through mainly because of a sluggish first half. The second half goes to fifth gear in such a rush that you are taken through the proceedings way too quickly. Some flaky, lame dialogue about truth and its incompatibility with the media. Blink. Samar (Emraan Hashmi) a reporter who just quit his job, gets a deal that is too good to be true. Blink. Emraan Hashmi-Neha Dhupia song. Blink. Emraan Hashmi-Sagarika Ghatge song. Blink. Interval. And all of this in a not so good way. What follows post-interval then happens all too quickly and doesn't manage to create interest that has gone in the negative with the first half. And somehow all of this ends up in a lecture to the audience about how we cannot handle the truth. Isn't that like the lamest excuse for any producer to make a lousy product? That's what the masses, the customer wants. You see, he doesn't like good things - honest reporters, non-sensationalized news, good films, he's such an idiot after all. So, here's the solution - let's make him consume mediocrity. Interestingly, despite having such an attitude towards its audience, the makers have chosen a topic recently attempted by Rann, the behind the scenes of a news channels. Nothing too shocking comes out of this attempt either. I would have brought up Wag The Dog but that would involve saying Dustin Hoffman and Robert De Niro in the same breath as Emraan Hashmi and Aditya Pancholi. So, I'll keep my peace. Speaking of which, the actors do whatever they have to take the movie forward. You don't feel sorry for anyone, nor do you feel terrorized by the power of the villain. The one good thing that you get out of Rush is Murli Sharma's character and the way he has played it. A delight! The women, Neha Dhupia and Sagarika Ghosh, look great but don't get a whole lot of room to look anything but fake. Yet, it does feel like this theme has a whole lot left unexplored. Another director, another writer, other actors, another film.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.I predicted it's fate while it's first promo was out, the whole story was out there itself, worst the film is in making since 2 years as the director passed away midway and his wife has completed the film. Poor Emraan Hashmi after going through his best phase here comes one bad film and a flop too@Silvan yeah it was sad to see the film deteriorate.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
