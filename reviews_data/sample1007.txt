Yes, itâ€™s the kind of humor that has a specific target audience. The kind who would love to see Rajnikant spoofed. But I don't see anything that can bring laughter, a few smiles - sure. A 90 minute film actually feels too long because of repetition.So, there's cool-dude Rajnikantha. And there are people who absolutely love the route his sunglasses or cigarette take to get to their destinations. Among these are people who can't stop going gaga over his invincibility. Sample this. Me? I find the silliness funny. The sunglass-cigarette routine make me smile about 3 times. But then, it gets repetitive and thus predictable and ultimately boring. Exactly what happens in Quickgun Murugun which spoofs Rajni.

Our man, Quickgun Murugun - the cowboy, the protector of the cows - is out to do his job, viz, protect cows from the fanatic non-vegetarian, Rice Plate Reddy. To fulfill his duty he convinces the officers of the other world to send him back to this world. And so on and so forth.
Sounds outrageous and out-of-the-world hilarious. But it ain't that ROFLarious. There isn't much comment you can make about such films, right? There's the usual ricocheting bullets and super-power-like action. Acting is intentionally over-the-top and overtly melodramatic - by one and all - okay except maybe the cameo by Vinay Pathak. 
So is the direction, especially in terms of the long pauses to enhance the already outlived-its-stay drama. Or even the emotional drama that punctuates the flow of the film, the exaggeration of everything in every frame. But, it's a spoof, so it's all obviously deliberate and supposedly necessary, what can you say? Certainly you are not allowed to complain. 
However, there are some bits and pieces that work. These make you smile and occasionally that smile grows wider. Each character's name is a cackle each. Also a lot of the smiles are hidden in the background, in the art-work, some reference that'll make you sneer at both - the joke and your smartness because you noticed it. 
Another bit I completely enjoyed is the background score. It's creative and it's funny. There's one bit where a western-film theme music is playing on a flute. Nice! 
There is also this comment on how super-heroes and God-like humans are necessary to get rid of the filth in the society today. A good vs. evil war is more obviously portrayed as a dev vs. daanav (God vs. Satan) war. What's more? Like Lord Krishna our man has more than one love interests. There are lot of tiny comments tucked in too. Like the irony that the anti-vegetarian demons have to use different vegetables as weapons. Celebrities used to advertise commodities, an Indian's love for mother's cooking, a mother's pride on how well she cooks, etc. 
But the novelty wears off. With each of the things I liked and found funny, it was so only for the first couple of times. The third repetition onwards it became boring. So much so that one and a half hour seems too long to sit there for this.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Warning: this section has some details that could distort your experience while watching the movie. I strongly recommend reading this only after you have seen the movie or if you have decided not to see it.Quickgun Murugun (Dr. Rajendraprasad) is a vegetarian and needs to protect all vegetarians from the fanatic non-vegetarian, Rice Plate Reddy and his intentions of converting everyone into a non-vegetarian. Have fun! Or maybe notâ€¦Quickgun Murugun (Dr. Rajendraprasad) is a vegetarian and needs to protect all vegetarians from the fanatic non-vegetarian, Rice Plate Reddy and his intentions of converting everyone into a non-vegetarian.

The opening sequence with depiction of heaven as a government office. 
The song "o little flower" :)
The techniques used to lure all the moms.
The new-age superhero smokes.
The haldi-kumkum (auspicious colored powders) on the bullet wound.

The editing - the slaps and the punches were way too badly done.
The comment that foreigner's don't understand the value of a mother's love.
Just dropping by to say I'm loving the new look! It's clean, simple and easy to navigate. The logo really works too.Thang-u! It's going to change very soon...enjoy it while it lasts! :)Damn..i thot the movie was an exceptional work. I really liked it. Though the tamil dialogues did not work for me..i still had a jolly good time.Copyright Â© 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.

Parental Guidance:


Violence: Loads. Spoofy but chopping, slicing, gun and fist fights all over the place. The title has two "gun"s in it after all.
Language: All pretty much clean. Except for a couple of innuendos
Nudity & Sexual content: One of the lead ladies is the keep of a character and is a dance bar artist. That involves its share of nudity.
Concept: Revenge, good vs. evil.
General Look and Feel: Light and slapsticky-spoofy funny. Don't know if kids will get the humor though.
