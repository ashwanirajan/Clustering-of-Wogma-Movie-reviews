Rangrezz, surprisingly puts a solid effort in writing a decent story. Yet, it takes the events to extremes towards the end, makes it too long and loses the plot. Some witty dialogue and a few well-timed performances keep the interest alive in an otherwise uneven second half. Rangrezz - produced by Vashu Bhagnani, lead actor Jacky Bhagnani. Just saying. Three films with Jacky Bhagnani as the protagonist and all three produced by Vashu Bhagnani. Just Saying. Call me judgmental and/or conservative, but it does make you wonder about the confidence the father-son duo have in the son's talent - is it over-confidence or diffidence?Anyway, Rangrezz's trailer suggests that the movie is all about friendship. So much so that, it felt like the 'anything goes in friendships' concept is being shoved down my throat. Interestingly, the lead's love angle is downplayed at least in the trailers. However, the catch/twist of having to help a friend elope with his bride isn't intriguing enough. There seems to be an additional twist which hasn't been made apparent. I hope there is. Else, they'll have to rely on the eloping completely to engage us through the length of the film.What I do like though is the energy that Jacky Bhagnani brings to his dance numbers. He brings life to even the done-to-death Govinda song. Let's hope there is more than Jacky Bhagnani's dancing talents to entertain us in Rangrezz. Music Reviews:
dunkdaft - "Sajid-Wajid as usual. "
Milliblog - "Sajid Wajid seem to be in a deep rut churning insignificant music."

  Deep friendships. Friends that take advantage of you. We all have at least a couple of both types. Rangrezz makes a  brave effort at showing you both the sides unlike what you are used to seeing in Bollywood. Unfortunately, it slacks of at times and takes the easier beaten-down route to redeem itself a little later - leading to a very uneven second half and an extremely dissatisfying conclusion.Rangrezz starts off with a collage of beautiful Mumbai monsoons in a heavily grey, tone pretty much resembling Mumbai what it looks like in the season. My surprise began with those initial shots. A little later when the colors and unwarranted close-ups come in, I was back to being comfortable because the movie began looking like what I had expected. And yet again, I was pleasantly being pulled into the set-up - the characters, the relationships, the wit and charm. Some of the dark humor really took the cake. This involvement was rudely disrupted with songs. Once the mandatory numbers were done with, the meat of the story began and was engagingly narrated to a wonderful peak at interval. After the break too, there are a few very interesting twists that catch you off-guard. Amazingly enough, they are not that largely unpredictable that you feel cheated. You see signs of the twist earlier, only that you don't think too much of it. Only problem though is these twists are balanced off with equally inane and typical turn of events. This wavelike movement in the writing gets more and more annoying and is completely blotched up at the end. Thankfully, the dialogue end of the writing department has taken its job very seriously and has come with some hilarious and witty lines. Completely supported by able delivery to whom most of them are given - Vijay Verma (Pakkya) and Rajpal Yadav (Maa). Jacky Bhagnani's dubbing is off which doesn't help his attempts to emote. I broke up laughing at a supposedly intense scene because Jacky Bhagnani is speaking and yet the camera is at an uncharacteristically, safe, crane top angle. The women are mostly redundant - they are either snubbed down or over-protected by the men around. Amongst the rest of the cast Amitosh Nagpal (Winu), Lushin Dubey (Mrs. Chaturvedi) and Pankaj Tripathi (Pande) leave an impression, especially considering the limited screen-time they have. The wonderful bit is that some of these characters stick and entertain despite being caricatures - more so Vijay Pakkya, Maa and Mrs. Chaturvedi. Or even the cute, petite grandmom. Another bit, I really enjoyed about Rangrezz are a couple of main threads being left unresolved in a very matter of factly manner. It's great that the makers decided to keep some details out, especially considering that the film is already a little too long. (Why not cut the songs out!)Unfortunately, Rangrezz insists on becoming a message film. The extremity and intensity with which the film is narrated almost makes you wonder if it is autobiographical - because some events are too off the chart to be imagined. Yet, Rangrezz ends up making you wonder about people and relationships. So, many turn of events in the film, do make you nod - "yep, as unbelievable as it looks, it does happen." Maybe, it's because I didn't expect such maturity from a Jacky Bhagnani film, preconceptions be hailed! But, I am looking forward to the next Priyadarshan film, just in case he decides to go the whole length and make a film that is not bogged down by the need for songs or being filmy.

womkerr:
          Priyadarshan's 'Rangrezz' is downright rubbish. My review --- http://womkerroncinema.blogspot.in/2013/03/colourless-emotions.html

vinzykavya:
          No offense to jackie but only good thing about rangrez was the title itself jackie is a great actor he should b choosy about his films
        
varun_k02:
          #rangrezz Bhagnaniji..itna paisa hain toh koi punya ke kaam main lagao na..aisi barbaadi kyu kar rahe ho?!
        
upsidedakshin:
          #Rangrezz bad plot, tried giving a message but turned out to be shaddy. Performance wise Jaccky was pretty good and his friends were good.
        
Time_To_Prove:
          Rangrez : shit of a movie..
        
Tarun0886:
          Rangrezz is so unlike Priyadarshan's make.. Good concept but sad plot, bad direction and even worse Ending..!! Not again sir jee...
        
StretfordEnd112:
          Rangrezz- So many flaws, so many.
        
saifu_rm:
          Done with Rangrezz - total disaster ! Now heading towards Jolly LLB to neutralise !
        
Robin_aries:
          'Rangrezz' is too bland to impress you
        
ParthGoel5:
          Saw rangrez horrible, horrible , horrible,  God save the viewers
        
OQSpot:
          I'd high expectations of #Rangrezz but a bit disappointed. Jackky was fab. Priya Anand had a small role but story let it down. Tepid watch
        
noHITdhARMANI:
          #Rangrezz is @jackkybhagnani's best performance by far. He proved himself as an actor in this one. But Priyadarshan failed big big time..!
        
ManiacRockstar:
          Was forced to watch Rangrezz with my cousin today. *Tweeting from a mental asylum now*
        
Kronosthelord:
          Rangrezz is without a doubt, the most crap filed movie of the year.
        
Kattar_Hindu7:
          Dear @jackkybhagnani #RAngrezz is Awesome Movie made by Priyadarshan. But Weakest Part of Movie is your Worst acting. So It became Flop-est.
        
InsaneMovieGeek:
          #Rangrezz becomes unwatchable with every passing minute.
        
iAshh:
          Entire Rangrez team shld b given life imprisonment for culpable homicide,illegal confinement for 2hrs&abetment 2 suicide.
        
FarazSalat:
          #Rangrezz is a typical bollywood's mechanical flick, and fails to show anything fresh. A waste of time.
        
dhunji:
          Also Rangrezz is a story of friendship and betrayal - Priyadarshan and Santosh Sivan's friendship and their betrayal of the producer
        
beingchaturvedi:
          Today u had lunch with my friends and after that we all watched rangrezz :) the film was not good at all
        
avneeshw:
          Rangrezz - A movie which starts on a bad note and gets worse as the movie progresses.....till you realize that you... http://www.facebook.com/avneeshw/posts/10151298962765685

akshaybafana:
          #Rangrezz Never watch a movie starring the producer's child as protagonist. Atleast b4 reading the reviews

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.It is a remake of a Tamil film, Naadodigal.No other producer will dare to waste money on very TALENDED (LESS) jacky bhagnaniYou are not alone. Everybody in my circle thinks the same. Who would waste money to watch Daddy da puttar's movie.. Will be a flop for sure.. !@HP I am sure it is, a Priyadarshan film :)@Kati kaati that's my point.@Anil Thank goodness for some mercies. :)like HP pointed out its remake of a tamil movie..so am not sure it makes sense to give such high points for the screenplay@ligne 2/5 is high o.O? Anyway, the rating is for the screenplay - if it is a scene by scene copy of the original one, then for original screenplay. If it was adapted for this film, then for the adapted one.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
