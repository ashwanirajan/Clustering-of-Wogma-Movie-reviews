Even if it might be the best animation film to come out of Mumbai, it is not good enough. There's an attempt to cram everything seen in films from Hollywood in one film, whether or not there's room for the concept. Yet, it might not be a bad entertainer for kids with some caramel popcorn handy.Munni vs. Sheila isn't enough, is it? We have to have a Loveena vs. Katrina, in a kids' animated film, no less. Is the idea to develop our kids into thinking it ain't a movie till it has an item number in it?! Even if the article is speculation, the trailers do have a Loveena character trying to exude oomph and get Aditya (Ajay Devgn) interested.So much so that Aditya's wife (Kajol) is actually insecure with Loveena dancing around her husband. Not to mention that Aditya himself is insecure about his role as a father. All of this could lead to a good story, but that only time will tell. 
Meanwhile, I'm excited to see any kind of development in animation. The characters look like they are right out of an Indian comic strip. They don't look primitive and they don't make you cringe like say they did in Krishna. Unfortunately, the way they talk and the things they talk about are pretty much like your every other Hindi film - exaggerated and loud. 
Not to mention, one of the other main characters who is a child is a Hindi movie buff. So, it's only a warning for us to gear up to a lot of Bolly references. Ajay Devgn has been tweeting a lot about his characters. 
This one  and a few before it give us glimpses of what we can look forward to other than a few funny lines and visuals from the promo. 
We here cannot harp enough that moviemakers need to spend their more of their budget on writers. But when it comes to animation, no justice can be done to the story without a handsome share to the animators. And yet, you need a good writing - story and dialogue - to be anywhere close to the kind of entertainment that animated films from the west offer. 
Even with animated films from Hollywood, I've always enjoyed the film better if there was a specific reason for the film to be animated rather than a story in which animals just replace humans, like say our very own 
Roadside Romeo  so that the film can be in animation. Toonpur Ka Superhero looks like it has a good enough premise for cartoon characters to run the show. Let's hope I enjoy it with my kids.

  An exciting start introduces you to a gamut of cartoon characters who largely represent real-life stereotypes but have potential to entertain. Unfortunately, the length of the film is restricted by the attention span of the target audience, clearly under 10. Hence, no justice can be done to any of those characters. So, you are left with a mish-mash of characters that just about stay together as a story. A story of a father wanting to be a hero for his kids, so what if it is fighting cartoons with the help of cartoons.

I'm sure kids below ten will enjoy the film, its gimmickry, slapstick included. But, I don't really like the idea of well-endowed women trying to move it and attract the attention of a man they woo by calling him handsome and hot. More so because these women are animated and meant to entertain kids
Sure, there's more to the film than the vamp, the anti-vamp and the wife who's insecure of women in sketch. I liked the bit where a dad's presence at a school race is more important to a child than the race itself. Similarly, it felt warm to see the importance a dad gives to his son's admonition and name-calling because the dad sees truth in it. 
But this warmth fizzles out as characters are introduced and you are disconnected slowly and surely from one and all. You don't root for anyone and you aren't scared for anyone's safety because of the threat the villain poses. In fact, the villain isn't given enough screen time to make an impact at all; most of it is hogged by Ajay Devgn and his childish antics. 
This is even more evident when some room is given to "rub-doot", a cartoon eraser. Those 5-7 minutes of his screen time are thoroughly enjoyable. I wish more such fun times were spent writing meatier bits for other characters. Over and above being superior to animation done thus far, we need some superior writing - animation or not. The wonderful glimpse you get makes you wonder, why you couldn't have had more. 
For those few moments, I just might send my kids to watch the film. Or maybe will have them wait for the DVD to be out on rent. Or maybe not. Or whatever.
