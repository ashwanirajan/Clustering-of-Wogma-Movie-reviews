Fiery thriller that doesn't let you think about anything else. For most parts anyway.“Oh! Why did they give such an awesome plot point away?” is the first thought that ran through my mind when Sonakshi Sinha's character shows her true self in the trailer. But, of course, they need to - to tell us what Akira is all about. It is such a thrill that there is enough in the story to still have enough hooks. Of course, then you have Konkona Sen Sharma and Anurag Kashyap show up. Here too, it is not only about their names. It is about the character and how they fit into the story. Especially, the one Anurag Kashyap plays – just the two-minute trailer washes away the awe of seeing him as an actor and replaces it with disgust and fear that a villain ought to instill. When everything about writing – the story, the characters and the dialogue - looks like they are out to win you, you have to look forward to the film. And of course, Sonakshi Sinha in a role that will test her skills, is really worth the wait by itself. I remember, how she took me by surprise in Lootera. Here's hoping for more of that, if only in a role that could be as diametrically opposite as is possible. Music Reviews:
Bollywood Hungama - "2/5" 
Milliblog - "Vishal-Shekhar in good form again, after Sultan." 
India Today - "Rajj Rajj Ke does not impress."  
Pinkvilla - "The music doesn't really live up to the standards of Vishal-Shekhar, but some elements of the songs will surely keep you hooked!"

  The protagonist gets into deeper and deeper trouble, and then some more. In many a film, the trouble becomes unsustainable in terms of the story's plausibility. But it has to move on, else it will feel anti-climatic after all that build up. So, the hole is dug deeper still. This is when the audience gives up and stops caring. Akira brings itself to the brink of such a situation, but it sprinkles in some interesting tidbits from real-life that keeps things believable. Almost. Very few films are able to hold interest to an extent that you don't look at your watch wondering, if it is interval/climax time yet. Akira's interval brings you back to the theater from her story. It is not that it is a smooth flowing story. It is a jerky move from Akira's childhood to adulthood, from small town to big city. And of course post-interval, it is a little bit of a struggle for Akira to keep it form becoming incredulous. But the main character is intriguing. She minds her own business and won't take non-sense. She is a loner and takes the consequences on her chin. She doesn't mind standing alone. So starved are we for strong female leads that this is mesmerizing. Would this film have worked as well if the protagonist was a man? It is really difficult to tell. Would the male actor have been able to keep his star persona at bay from the character? Would he be able to stay subtly uninvolved without any signature moves? Would the director have been able to keep the drama away?The story by itself doesn't necessarily need the protagonist to be a woman. This is exactly what works for Akira. The lead lady could have been anyone with a strong will and a stronger mind. And of course, a very strong body. And Sonakshi Sinha plays it like it was any human being with those characteristics. No airs about her character, no privilege for being a woman, no sense of entitlement. Akira, the film, doesn't give Akira, the character advantage for being a woman. No one treats her like a weak person. In fact, the college bully too is a woman. Akira might as well have been a side character from another film. And that is a good thing. There is nothing larger than life about her.Sonakshi Sinha does it just right too. There is no great need for her to showcase different emotions in Akira. She is a confident, strong-headed woman who know how to throw in a kick. Her medication-induced disorientation works well too. We could complain that in some sense her character is flavorless. But, it is better fewer shades to her character than to have her break into song and dance, on the beat, every 20 minutes. Yes, there is no extraneous stuff like a romantic track or song and dance. Which is why, as much in the background as it was, the family angle felt out of place. Chopping some of it off, would have made the film crisp. And anyway, just Akira and ACP Rane are enough. Anurag Kashyap as a devious, manipulative police officer has a menacing screen presence. He's dangerous and soulless. Again, there are no shades to his character. And again, it is better than him becoming into a caricature of a villain. It is amusing that his character, ACP Rane can spin a yarn in the blink of an eye. Like the story-teller in Anurag Kashyap in real life? The film nods at other realities of  life with amusement too, like equipment and vehicles used by police officers. Or its remark on a system where an acid attacker gets away because he is connected but an acid attack defender serves time and is marked for life. However, as the film progresses it becomes less and less believable - both the cover-ups and the exposé. Fortunately, by then you are rooting hard for the protagonist. And then things are wrapped up, even if in a hurry – just before they are let loose uncontrollably out of the realm of reality. Akira is no fairy tale. There are no charming princes and no fairy god mothers. Sure, there is a warrior princess and the devil. Their fight is enough to keep us absorbed. They fight long and hard. Maybe a tad too long. The usual trappings of the second-half syndrome however, are just about tolerable to make Akira absorbing enough to stay in memory after the walk out of the theater.

        ...The film will surely remind you of Aamir Khan’s Ghajini but thanks to Akira’s gripping plot which is so absorbing that one doesn’t have enough time to ponder upon the comparison. There are few scenes that look unreal; the one where a fellow mate helps Sonakshi to escape from the mental asylum, which is slightly dreamlike. Akira is a great effort by director A R Murgadoss. Watch it for its layered mystery and Sonakshi Sinha’s finest performance by far!

There are some truly cringeworthy moments littered about the entire film. Anurag Kashyap deserves special mention for his excellent portrayal as the corrupt policeman, with Sonakshi Sinha doing a decent job as well. If only her character was better written Akira would’ve been an easy movie to recommend. As it stands, you can avoid this one.

This film is a good one-time watch, but like we said, if you’re tired of clichéd situations and unneeded drama, you can skip this one. As an overall film for the masses, it deserves 3 out of 5 stars.

They've even argued that she's only good at playing second fiddle to the lead (Dabangg, Son of Sardar, Rowdy Rathore and most others). With this one, she attempts flipping this perception over its head. But sadly, excessive violence and jarring plot holes (for example, Akira's family gives up on her when she's framed as 'mentally unstable') are too distracting to ignore.

himeshmankad:
          The only issue with #Akira is the slow pace and a bit unrealistic second half. None the less, it is a one time watch
        
AnamikaS:
          If you like Action Films, you may like #Akira While the first half was really good, the 2nd half disappointed! #WomenCentricFilms

: Not much here
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.The trailer does press the right buttons but mainly because we see a female samurai of sorts.  Let's hope that it has a bit more novelty over and above replacing a male lead by a female lead.@Fan I agree. I really hope this is more than 'woman' for novelty.Just saw this film last night....I think the female lead has biased the review. Switch it with any other male as the lead and you are left with the typical Bollywood pot boiler. Not much to write home about other than stretching of the imagination.Akira as a film disappointed me.  With A R Murugadoss at the helm of affairs and an A level lead actress, a lot was expected.The sequence of events and the way they play out seem just illusionary.  Even if we are biased and want to believe what is happening, it is just difficult to do so as the events unfolding are simply unbelievable.Before signing off, a few words for Kashyap, whose works and statements I am the first to criticize most of the time.  I must admit that he has done a very good job of playing the corrupt to the core policeman, and just his presence on the screen not only makes you abhor him but also fear him.
