Animation scores though animals behave no different from humans. They dance sleazily even in a kids' movie!NOT A REVIEW - Just excited about the quality of animation!Will my kids really get to watch a Hindi movie made for kids with decent computer graphics? There is hope with the one bank that hopefully will not dry soon - the Yash Raj bank.There is one concern that I always have with a movie in this genre, especially with animals and inanimate objects - contextualization. I don't see the point of making animals do what humans do in other movies. When that happens, it feels unnecessarily honey-coated, over-the-top-cute animals/cars/toys falling in love and fighting villains. The one wonderful example of story completely in tune with the context of the ocean-world is Finding Nemo. Fish were doing fish things like bouncing off sharks and jellyfish and making friends with turtles. Versus say , where cars were running hotels and managing cities. Oh well, expressive caricatures, hopefully with adequate support from Walt Disney is a good start...

  Just because a movie is animated and set in a fantasy land doesn't mean it is for kids. But, when you advertise it on kids' TV channels, implies you are targeting them. Then it absolutely peeves me off, the instant you have a central male lead bragging about scoring with 'chicks' in the opening song. It is a sheer letdown that the YRF banner, which usually has decent-sized, significant roles for women, have the two she-characters as mere sidekicks. And the sole function of one is to be wooed by men for her sexiness physical beauty.Nevertheless, the graphic design is certainly one giant leap for Hindi movies. If only the story were too. Even if we forget that dogs are on two-legs, own salons, and dance to sensuous moves at pubs, the basic story is snore-worthy. Not to mention we have seen humans do it countless times. Anyway, one step at a time, I guess. It is sort-of funny when a movie where Aditya Chopra is involved in the writing has references to his earlier movies. Not so when it features in EVERY Yash Raj film. So is this the contract the writer signs at gunpoint? So, yeah if you are likely to enjoy another movie full of digs at their own films, this is one you might completely enjoy. Once you have accepted that, the imaginative and smart dialogues keep that smile glued to your face throughout. It was especially hilarious to see the audience hoot when they hear Kareena Kapoor on screen. She sure has a faithful fan following, even if she's playing a bitch! Saif Ali Khan and Jaaved Jaaferi aren't doing anything especially new with their voices. They all just sound a little gruffy, as if the same digitized special effect was layered over their usual voices. I wouldn't want my kids to watch something that implies so much disrespect towards women and is more-or-less story-less. But, they will. And they are most likely going to enjoy it too. Yeah-yeah-yeah, lighten up, diwali hai (it's the festive season)...oh well...

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Romeo has to help the local goon score a date with Laila (the local beauty).Romeo has to help the local goon score a date with Laila (the local beauty).Hey Sudhir, you still around? I thought you had stopped visiting wogma :) Prashant and Dattaprasad, mythological or 'woo a gal' - it has to be well-made. It is done with so much crass (and unfortunately no different from other such Hindi movies) that i wouldn't want my kids to watch it, just like i don't like the violence in power rangers but that in tom and jerry is alright.Dattaprasad, it'll be nice if you can explain what you mean by visuals versus animation.hmmm, thanks Dattaprasad. Will certainly add to my experience in watching animated movies henceforth.[...] A REVIEW - Just wondering if this one is really for the kids unlike some other films floating around in the name of kids [...]Sexual content: A kiss between the dog and the bitch.lol hahahahaha;)Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.

Parental Guidance:


Violence: A little bit of fighting around, but all animated.
Sexual content: A kiss between the dog and the bitch.
Concept: A dog has to help a goon in wooing the she-dog he likes. 
General Look and Feel: It is peppy and made with kids in mind. Unfortunately not the story.
