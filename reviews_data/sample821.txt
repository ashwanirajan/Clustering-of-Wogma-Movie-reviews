Game was supposed to be a thriller. One which makes you sit on the edge of your seat and bite, whatever is left of, your nails from the cricket matches. It's none of that and more. It's sluggish and I have quite a few nasty things to say about its 'style'.An action thriller! I for one can't have enough of them, especially if they have world-class production values. Yes, it is important for this genre to look polished. And if nothing else, slick films is what we have come to expect from, anything that Farhan Akhtar (as producer in Game) gets involved with. Here's the sample - But this genre is also very mean to loopholes in the script. A tight plot is imperative. If the film is based solely on the visuals, in this day and age of exposure to the best from all over the world, the audience will get a "been there, seen that" feeling. 
Abhinay Deo (son of Ramesh and Seema Deo) seems to recognize this need. 
 What I'd like to learn is that the script is the heart of the film. This is one thing we as Bollywood lack. We work on projects and not on scripts. We put together a great cast and a great crew but nobody thinks of putting together a great script.
Game supposedly has a very twisted script. Four strangers from different corners of the world get an invite to stay on some island. And mystery ensues. It does sound a lot like  Shalimar and Gumnaam. Well, we'll know soon enough. 
Fortunately, this genre doesn't necessarily require too many acting skills. The actors can get away with just being presented in style. Abhishek Bachchan looks his suave self. Kangna Ranaut sounds as avoidable as ever. Hopefully the new face in the film, Sarah will compensate for her presence. However, what  she has to say about her character isn't very inspiring - 
What my character in the film, Maya, goes through in her life is very difficult for any normal human being to fathom.
That basically translates to, "My character is as far removed from reality as you could imagine." Oh well, it’s a thriller, we can't expect character development and such from it now, can we? 
Good music though, certainly. Especially considering its an Excel Entertainment product. But the response to the album isn't all positive. 
Music reviews:
milliblog - "Game is an interesting effort from the trio – the sound works!"
music aloud - "7.5/10"
Bollyspice - "3.5/5"
Bollywood Hungama - "2.5/5"
HappySing - "if you’re thinking of buying the album just because you know Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy and you know their standard, you may be in for a little disappointment."

  We are grade 'A' fools, who aren't at all exposed to any kind of cinema other than the one dished out in the name of 'style' and 'thrill'. We don't watch the umpteen Television series from around the world from our couch, so we don't know what the very basics of a murder mystery. Yes, I'm furious. What are we in the eyes of our filmmakers? Deprived souls who have to be thankful for whatever we get?

Maybe I wouldn't have been this irked if they had fulfilled at least one of the things they set out to achieve - style or substance. The story has zilch in terms of drama or suspense. No, pausing before every word of every dialogue doesn't fulfill that need to be nervous about what's going to happen next. If you make me hang for every word you say, literally, I will doze off. 
The style is largely superficial too. Even if you disregard the fact that there's nothing you haven't seen earlier. Unless the last you saw a Hindi film was 15 years ago, then the style might hold something for you. But then again, I'd recommend the film directed by the person who produced this film - Don.
Geez, who'd have known that a day would come when I'd recommend a Shahrukh Khan film over an Abhishek Bachchan one. It was cool when Abhishek walked that lop-sided stylish walk or sat lounging heavy on one side, clad in white against a red backdrop. After the first time though it's called repetition and predictable. You got to give me something more interesting than that. Especially when the next in line to try and impress me is Kangna Ranaut trying to finish off her English lines in a hurry. 
Sheeeesh! Sorry for the break in flow, but I just can't get over on how much one can be blind to the banality of the basic plot! Not to mention that whatever Abhishek's character does is a tangent to the main plot. And the writer's confusion is transparent - should I focus on the main plot or should I make the sub-plot bigger so we can offer it to a mainstream actor. 
You know what, I "shhuushed" the guy sitting next to me in the first hour because he kept saying, "what a bore yaar!" And when the main "twist" came along, I wouldn't have the heart to resist if that guy forced my foot into my mouth. 
Not fair. The filmmakers have actually made me feel bad about doing the right thing. I actually wanted that guy to pay attention to their film.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Four people are lured into an island on one specific day. Only to find themselves in a spot where murder might be the only way to get out.Four people are lured into an island on one specific day.

The titles. Nicely done. Loved the glassy dice cubes.
Is everything else a good answer?Is everything else a good answer?Meetu this is one of the most convicing  and hilarious review i have ever read.i think certain filmakers really intend to test patience from their viewers like ramu's Aag.i really enjoyed reading each line of your review and now i feel my money is repaid. Thanks'@Guddu ha ha! thanks, man![comment deleted because it gives the climax away in a lot of detail]@Sarada Thanks!@yeast infection remedy (if you are not spam), ha ha! some of them are alright. :D@Roy sorry had to delete your comment, however lame the film is, can't have the story given away.@Meetu - I don't know, we kind of enjoyed this one. It was one of Bachchan Jr. better acting jobs - he not only did his sullen unshaven badass act, he actually managed some scenes of genuine sadness and loss (not something we've seen him do much of). The twists were, yah, about what you'd expect when you have a movie with Abhishek Bachchan playing a slick crook, but we thought he sold it better than usual - for a bit there, if you squinted, you could convince yourself he really was his father's son. Nice to see Anupam Kher playing an actual part rather than "Uncle", Jimmy Shergill nailed "oily weak movie star", and though he mugged a bit in spots this was another impressive Boman Irani performance (if he can stop wanting to wink at the audience, he could be one of India's best actors). Honestly, I thought Kangna Ranaut played her Hot Buttkicking Woman Cop better than you did - she moved like she was ready to fight or duck behind cover any second, she held a gun like she could use it and rocked her shoulder holster, and her eyes went cop-flat when they were supposed to. She was sure a lot more convincing police officer than her partner was - he looked like The Producer's Nephew given a prop gun and a couple lines of dialogue!@TimELiebe And here I thought I was good at looking for something to appreciated in a film. :)@Meetu - Something Something American Fan Who Loves Trashy Movies! :DThough yes - I was actually more impressed with Abhishek Bachchan's acting than I usually am.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
