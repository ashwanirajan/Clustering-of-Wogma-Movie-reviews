A war thriller that has potential to tingle your patriotism and even bring you to your seat's edge. But for the melodrama and the technical stuff that seems just too implausible.War films have their own charm. And a pretty much standard story arc too. The Ghazi Attack is something we know very little about, so that in itself makes for something to look forward too. However, the trailer itself has a slight flavour of jingoism masked under patriotism. Hopefully, it won't cross that thin line.Fortunately, the trailer does point towards personal stories and characters. There is also an element of suspense in the form of the only lady in the trailer. And of course, with the likes of Atul Kulkarni, Kay Kay Menon in action, we are sure to have good performances. The drama which could very easily become melodrama, looks like it is under control. Hopefully, this hunch will hold out to be true.

  Whether or not it's true war story, The Ghazi Attack makes for a decent thriller. Once you have accepted all the technical jargon as true, that is. There is so much of the latter that believing the story is true becomes more and more difficult with every passing minute. Sure, sonar technology is mind-boggling and all the things shown might even be possible. There can still be no excuse for overt drama as the film progresses in a film that otherwise seemed to have been avoiding it. War films with an undercurrent of mutiny always make for interesting stories. Your sensitivity is hooked from the word go because you know which country your loyalties lie with. But you are debating what side to be on, in the mutiny. What makes a person become a soldier? You can't deny him his patriotism once he is on the field. Is it wrong then, for him to follow his passion – of slaying the enemy without provocation? But if soldier were to follow this passion of theirs, there would be mayhem. These are the philosophies you are struggling with as you see the war between discipline-orders vs. killer instinct with an agenda. This build-up is thoroughly engaging, even if the end is mighty predictable from the beginning. However, post-interval this gives way to melodrama that you would expect in a typical war film. That is disappointing at first and gets boring soon enough. Then, our beliefs in bravery and a human body's physical capacity are tested.The melodrama of course, seeps into the performances – from dialogue delivery to glistening eyes to exaggerated expressions. In a shot earlier in the film, for instance Atul Kulkarni is flustered between what he thinks might be right and what his commander (Kay Kay Menon) is commandeering. Without a line you know why Kulkarni is doing what he is doing. Come second half though, you see him lecture another officer in an extremely affected manner. The tone of the film sinks into the regular fare, from a controlled, nuanced clash of characters. Fortunately, the visual texture of the film stays the same. The film alternates between the murky blue, deep sea and the cringy, clanky, claustrophobic insides of a submarine without any respite. This makes the film stand out from the usual Hindi films and helps it stay true to what it wants to be – an uncomfortable, edgy watch. If only, the consistency in tone had stuck through the other departments of the film – especially the writing.

He knows he can't be running after verisimilitude in terms of visual details. So he does the best thing possible - he shoots interesting details, lets his actors work on their performances, loses all flab of comedy and songs (no song in the film! woohoo!), and keeps a close grip on the pace. The score (K - yes, that's the composer's credit title), the visuals, the edits, they all work like a charm.

But having said that, The Ghazi Attack should be watched because of the unique experience it provides. It is doubtful another submarine movie with such high production standards will release in Bollywood anytime soon. So as long as it is there in theatres, it deserves to be watched.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Its a nice movie with good plot. Would be a watch I hope.nice reviewFilm screenplay and characterisation  is excellent l. Rana  dugdugadi.., k. K. Menon,  atul  kulkarni  and even in small role On Puri, tapsi  pannu Nadir all are excellent  sankalp  direction is excellent anhe has scope of a different path breakingThis is a war movie like any other war movie anywhere in the world.  Only difference is that this time it is under water.The technical side of the film is very well done.  The look and feel of the insides of a submarine are well portrayed.  Gone are the days of the cardboard boxes made sets in Hindi films.  There is enough naval vocabulary scattered all throughout to impress the layman.  And you have your typical Hindi war film glimpses into the civilian lives of our uniformed heroes.  A few goose bump moments of patriotism were also there.Despite all this, and despite the liberal sprinkling of patriotic songs and chants, and despite the fact that India as a country is clearly and visibly going through an ultra nationalist phase in its history of 70 years - despite all these factors the film fails to strike a chord in the heart.  It is difficult for me to pinpoint the reason for this failure.  There are enough cat and mouse moments between the two enemy nations, the cast is composed of a fine set of actors, but the "real" feeling is missing. Too many coincidences, too many catches dropped by Pakistan, too many run outs missed.  Just gives a feeling that it is a rigged match, even if it is rigged to make your home team look good.The intention behind the making of the film is good, but I cannot say the same about the execution.  It is between a "Thumbs down" and "so-so".  Only reason I am going with a "so-so" is due to the overall under water submarine based theme which is a change from your regular land-based war films.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.

Parental Guidance:


Violence: While it is a war film with torpedoes flying underwater, there is no real hand-to-hand combat.
Language: Clean
Nudity & Sexual content: None
Concept: Submarines of the Indian and Pakistani naval forces engage in war.
General Look and Feel: Blue. It is the eerie water or the claustrophobic submarine.
