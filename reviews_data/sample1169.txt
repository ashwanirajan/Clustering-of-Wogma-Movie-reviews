Curiosity kills the cat. I understand you are curious about seeing Himesh on the big screen. But, would you want to add to their kitty by watching an absolutely worthless movie which is frilled with bad performances? Only saving grace is cinematography, but certainly doesn't make it worth your or any one else's hard-earned money.I want to be an actor too - I have more than one and a half facial expressions. Oh, but will that mean I have to be a nasal singer and crack a poor joke about myself on the big screen? The good thing though, is that I would need to be a music director with just one tune in my head. Lyricists who can change the words around a bit here and there must be readily available. No, never mind, I can't, I don't wear a cap that a houseful theater would hoot and whistle at. Too predictable of one to talk about Himesh's cap, well if he can have a badly timed joke about it, why can't I?Okay, I exaggerated on the music bit. Himesh has certainly tried at least one tune ("Dil na todna") a little out of his usual style, but listening to it you wish he hadn't. The camerawork and lighting of the first song "assalaam vaalekum" is beautiful. But then things deteriorate. Song-after-song-after-song (thank me for not doing that 5 more times). On the way he forgets pronunciation - have never heard "bina" and "tanhaiyaan" being crooned out so badly. And to top it off, we have the sacrilege called "Mehbooba mehbooba". Were they actually given permission to do this to a song from Sholay? Dear Mr. Burman, I apologize for listening to this version of arguably one of your best compositions. And while am it, Mohammad Rafiji, I am sorry for laughing out loud at what was done to "dard-e-dil" of Karz.Having totally trashed the two main attractions of the movie - the lack of acting by Himesh Reshammiya and then the music - I must tell you something about myself. I am a very patient person as far as movies are concerned. It is usually very difficult for a movie to bore me. Even after about half an hour post interval, I was hopeful. Hopeful that at least the story will be an actual thriller. Alas, the completely lose it thereafter! Far from causing any sort of a thrill, some bits were slow - allowing enough unintended giggle-time - and thus bored till hair be torn apart. The last half hour was plain, outright, superbly ridiculous!! Who gave them a right to take us so much for granted?!  There are no well rounded characters for me to really complain about character inconsistency. Anyone can do anything or nothing. Most characters can transform from evil to good without the slightest provocation and with most inane dialogues for support. And when there are such glaring gaps I don't really have the right to talk about details like a person changing his cap after being arrested.Ah yes, how can I not mention the quintessential "oomph" factor - Ms. Sherawat. She does her bit. Flaunts her body, dances a couple of dances, utters the mandatory line or two, because she is a character in the plot after all. And Ms. Motwani, well, she looks sweet and has so much eye-shadow on, that she can barely open her eyes. Oh yeah, and what is with the lipstick for Sachin Khedekar and the bright orange lip gloss for Pankaj Jha?What can I say when the most interesting part of the two+ hours spent in the theater was the 30 second teaser of "Sultan The Warrior" (actually looking forward to it!)?

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Warning: this section has some details that could distort your experience while watching the movie. I strongly recommend reading this only after you have seen the movie or if you have decided not to see it.Himesh Reshammiya (Himesh Reshammiya (who said he is full of himself?!)) is an Indian rock star who is on a stage show abroad. He gets framed for murder.  What happened before the murder and after is what we spend two hours+ watching.Himesh Reshammiya (Himesh Reshammiya (who said he is full of himself?!)) is an Indian rock star who is on a stage show abroad. He gets framed for murder.  What happened before the murder and after is what we spend two hours+ watching.
The camerawork in general. Especially in the first two songs.
Stylisation of  Himesh Reshammiya's character in the first  15-20 minutes. Unfortunately it doesn't stick through to the end. 

The chemistry between HR and Hansika Motwani. Towards the end they looked more like brother and sister than lovers.
Dubbing was off at too many places - especially in the slow motion scenes.
How does Shravan (HR's friend) know about Nadia Merchant's murder when he wasn't even present when the police came in?
Why did Anant Mahadevan have to be roped in for such a trivial role?
Misuse of child artist (Trishu) - was she brought in just to crack that one silly joke?
Hansika Motwani's solo dance on a stone path in the song "ye tera mera milna". People who cannot dance should certainly not be given such hideous steps!
The close-up of Sachin Khedekar's hands in the scene where HR talks about marriage. It looked very out of context and thus forced.
It is amazing how HR and his friend were totally drunk and HR was back home by 9pm?
Weren't HR and his friend living in the same house? Then how come only HR got back home?
I still don't get why marriage is such a high priority in Hindi movies? It's as if that is the only thing that gives women any sort of an identity.
How did the gunman know where HR was going to stop the car?
A criminal roaming all over town in broad daylight without the slightest fear of being caught.
Why does Mallika Sherawat's character, Ruby, have a change of heart?
Use of sitar for Sachin Khedekar's emotional dialogues seems out of place with rest of the background score.
I have always wondered...when a person is accused of a crime and he escapes from jail, when he finds the true criminal, is he scott free? Doesn't he need a judge to say that he is no longer guilty?

The rear-view mirror of the car in the opening scene was reflecting nothing!
In "Assalaam vaalekum" - towards the end of the song, the mike is in HR's hand and then in the next shot is on the stand.
Sexy seductress she may be. But, why does a  lawyer "catwalk" out of her bathroom, when she is alone in the house?
Hansika Motwani says, "most luckiest girl". I say, "yuckiest grammatical error". 
How come Sachin Khedekar's house was empty when his daughter was supposed to get married the next day?
Why is Hansika wearing pink lipstick with a red wedding dress?
I don't mean to be nitpicky, but one needs to get one's facts right while trying to inject humour into one's writing. You need to apologize to rafi Saheb, not Kishore Kumar ji for 'Laughing out loud at what was done to dard-e-dil of Karz'Aditya, Preeti, thanks for pointing out the mistakes in this post. Mis-identifying the singer of "dard-e-dil" as Kishore Kumar was a blunder. The incorrect rating of "Must See - on the big screen" was a technical glitch caused due to an upgrade in the software I use to post reviews. (The upgrade was for automatically creating the index of movie reviews by rating and alphabetically.)I am deeply sorry for both mistakes, and will hopefully not make such slips again.Sorry.Hi Himesh,u r n outstanding actor with gesture n ur performance is extra-ordinary,marvellous & impressive.may god bless you for your entire career as an actor.U did very good acting in aap ka suroor so keep it up.[...] Everything I have read says the movie is way way way (way) below par.
