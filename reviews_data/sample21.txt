Hurried in its story-telling and a little too relaxed in its execution, Ittefaq makes the biggest mistake a thriller could make - it tells a gripping story instead of showing it. It has been quite some time since we have seen a good thriller. It has been even longer since a thriller's trailer and promotions have been so exciting. Karan Johar, Siddharth Malhotra and Sonakshi Sinha have been building the suspense through their Twitter accounts. Interestingly, the build-up on Twitter takes on a different aspect of the story compared to the one exposed in the trailer. This has intrigued me even further because now it is unclear which one will be the main story, the murder of Siddharth Malhotra's character's wife and the lawyer as indicated by the trailer or that of Sonakshi Sinha's character's husband as building up on Twitter?Moreover, the vantage point take on the story will only make it more interesting. Of course, there is a chance of it becoming repetitive but the trailer gives a sense that the director-writer will manage to avoid it. Can't wait to find out! Ittefaq releases on 3 November, 2017.
    - meeta, a part of the audience
  The most important part of a thriller is how the audience comes to know whodunnit. The actual character who did it or why they did what they did is secondary. Many thrillers cop out on the how by a character narrating how it all happened. There is no unraveling only a summarised monologue of a revelation. When that happens, the build-up seems like a tool to keep your attention rather than to get you thinking and involved. If you haven’t guessed it yet, Ittefaq does exactly that. A rich thriller story which could have been enhanced in its telling is let down by the way it executes the crux.Other than that Ittefaq has the usual murder-mystery aura about it. Through flashbacks, the accusation passes from one suspect to another and back as fast as a parcel does the rounds in a game of passing the parcel. When it stops, the game slows down. While each flashback builds the story, the present time sequences mostly have the suspects saying they didn’t do it – which they have been doing a lot of, on their real-life Twitter accounts too. These scenes also have extraneous elements such as a flickering tubelight or the investigating officer, Dev’s home and wife. In hindsight these seem like fillers to extend the run-time. It would have helped if the clues in the investigation in present-time didn’t come about so easily in the first half. Interestingly, Dev is introduced as this smug investigating officer who just knows where to look for evidence. Later in the film though, he turns into a cop who happens to remember evidence because of what he is doing perchance and reaches new conclusions. No slick deductive skills there. The CSI/Dexter-esque analysis seems like an afterthought. Then there are the logical questions like, why is the interrogation in piecemeal in the first place? Wouldn’t the officers get the whole story out in one sitting? Had the story moved forward more in the non-flashback parts of the film, the film would have felt less like a drag. For a film that is less than 2 hours, Ittefaq spends a fair amount of time lingering – and not in a good way. The tone is set by the chase sequence that the film begins with. It goes on for over five minutes and nothing additional is being told to you in those introductory scenes. If at all, it focuses on a police officer who snoozes and takes pleasure in scaring suspects and witnesses alike – and he is not even one of the main characters of the film! A fair amount of time is also spent on  dry humor. A thriller usually uses humour to relieve you from the intensity of the suspense. Here though the mystery doesn’t build up enough and the humour ends up deviating from the little thrill. I was also distracted by the continuity in lighting. Usually in such cases, I don’t let the technical aspects of film-making bother me, but Ittefaq’s indecisiveness about whether it is night and day was too difficult to ignore. A scene that looks like it is day-time is interspersed between scenes of the same night. No, this wasn’t an attempt at non-linearity. What keeps you interested is actually the hope of a mind-bending twist, which unfortunately doesn’t come about. On the other hand, except for the title, I’m glad Ittefaq doesn’t fall for the other crime that thrillers are usually guilty of – intentionally misleading the audience. Also thankfully, the performances even if not the greatest, aren’t distracting either. Siddharth Malhotra does well to keep his expressions ambiguous. If you believe he is not guilty, you will see innocence. If you believe he is guilty, you will see a hidden smirk. Sonakshi Sinha too does well to don completely different avatars in the two versions of the story. Akshaye Khanna anchors the film with a monotonous expression, but that is attributable to the writing. A thriller that attempts to be tight ought to have minimal role for side characters, but Ittefaq gives them too much room. Due to no fault of theirs, this invasion got me annoyed at the actors. I submit I am equally annoyed at not being brought to the edge-of-my-seat. I didn’t see myself taking sides and swaying with the alternating narratives. And the worst of it all, at the end, I felt like I was at a screenplay narration and not at the screening of a chilling narrative.

In all fairness its not the type of thriller that blows your mind, but it is the kind of mystery drama that builds loads of intrigue and leaves you with a pleasant dash of surprise...

          Ittefaq was kind of ok. Akshaye was top class. It seemed as if the role was tailor made for him. The big reveal was a bit underwhelming.

Above average film but Akshay Khanna is too good as a Police Officer.
It's not a "Suspens-Triller" but a "Suspense"

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Two whodunnits. Two whodunnits. 
The introduction of the twist. Even if it was expected, the way it came about was done well.
The difference in how an accused man and woman are treated for the murder of a spouse. Came across as real. 

Why is the film called Ittefaq?
Why dosn’t Vikram Sethi ever get a lawyer?
The scene with the dog.
The scene with Dev in the toilet.   
The old maid knocking on Maya’s door. Isn’t it late in the night? Why is a maid coming in to do some scrubbing?   
The whole timeline of events at J W Marriott. Didn’t Vikram say they had arrived just for the book launch? How come they were caught fighting a couple of days before the book launch?
Dev’s monologue doesn’t help to keep the suspense.

Is there a crematorium by the sea in Mumbai?
Take a fairly twisty plot. Give it the blandest treatment possible. Juggle between the flashbacks till the audience no longer cares about who-dun-what-to-whom. Very disappointing film.This film is supposed to be based on the film with the same name, Ittefaq.  Personally I consider the original Ittefaq as one of the best thriller made by Bollywood.  The film had tanked at the box office as it was considered too short, less than 2 hours running time in days when audiences wanted no less than 3 hours; it was considered bland - with zero songs in days when at least 5 songs was the norm; and a chocolate hero being shown with shades of grey?  The film was well ahead of its times.  Made for the 2017 audiences.The 2017 version comes across as a very lazy attempt to recreate the tension.  But it fails.  Many reasons but principally it is very slow paced, kind of Lootera pace.  One can be pardoned for saying that fast paced thriller only happens in films and not in real life, just as a hawaldar remarks in the movie that police paying an informer only happens in films.The worst part of the film is the revealation of the crime.  It just spoils whatever little interest was remaining in the story.The only good part were the few moments of dry humour sprinkled across the film.Akshay Khanna stands out but then we have seen him in this role, including dress and behaviour, in quite a few films now.Watch it to learn how a classic can be massacred in the hands of novices.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
