
wogma rating: Watch when on TV/online (?)
A decent enough plot butchered by filmi-ness viz, dialogue-baazi,  overt style, romantic track, songs and so on. Every time an Akshay Kumar movie is announced, I find myself questioning the purpose of existence. Of the film, of course, but also of my existence in the theater. It is not because I don't like the man or his performances. After years of having watched films in mainstream Hindi cinema, I have learnt that there is always hope. You can never tell when an actor will spring in a surprise. In fact, I thrive for those times. But, as you see Holiday, you know it is just going to be the same ol', same ol'.It's just that it might be a combination of two same ol's. The first of the trailer indicates that it will be like the other Akshay Kumar comedies and the second half points to his action films. The premise might be that of a soldier and how he is never off duty, but doesn't look like the content is going to be too different.Right from the music, the choreography, even the lead lady all feel like a repeat. Not to mention, there will be dialogue that will be repeated for "impact". That the film is directed by the director of Ghajini makes me  believe that we will have a more than full dose of melodrama and overt style too.What then makes me go to the theater? Hope. Thin and a sliver, it may be, but hope there always is. Music Reviews:
Bollyspice - "1.5/5" 
Milliblog - "Pritam’s winsome sound beats the Tamil original’s music hollow!" 
Music Aloud - "7.5/10"   
    - meeta, a part of the audience
  After the initial "let's get your attention, so you are in your seat" romantic track, Holiday surprises you with  a decent, thickening plot between an army officer and terrorists. But, as it goes with this genre in Hindi, there are way too many plot holes. And even if you ignore them, there are too many side-tracks in the form of songs and sub-plots to take the film seriously.You have a lead lady (Sonakshi Sinha) who can box, pole vault, play rugby, run, do karate while the lead actor woos her.  In the one song that focuses on her as a character, the main point seems to be Akshay Kumar's dance moves. Come to think of it, I don't think any song has her even lip-syncing. Looks like comic relief ain't enough no more, you need romantic relief. Speaking of which, Govinda is such a misfit and/or waste as comic relief here.These come across as fillers with the intention of selling a product that you are not confident about. Add to the mix, desperate stylisation of the hero and dialogue that doesn't belong. Which is such a shame because despite the gaps in logic and logistics the plot is not half bad.  Akshay Kumar fans then might find some respite in the Akshay Kumar-ness of the film. While I have no clue exactly what such a fan looks for, I'd say the actions scenes are cool while they last, though there aren't way too many of them. Hope that helps. On the other hand though, there is hardly any challenge for him from the other side. Both, the villain character and actor are just too dull to make you want to root one way or the other. Thematically too, Holiday tends to get into the preachy zone, almost reprimanding you for not appreciating the efforts of soldiers at the border. Yet, I'd call my 3 hours in the movie hall a success, considering it is nowhere bad to what I expected it to be. Do I give a film extra points for that? Naah. It is just what it is. A casual TV watch if you chance upon it.

        ...Like most Indian masala movies, Holiday tastes best with a generous few pinches of salt. Akshay Kumar’s face looks too old to be a young army captain. But the way he jumps over cars and navigates down building faces is a feat even the fittest 20-year-olds can only dream of. He is the soul of this film. He makes it fun. He gives you your money’s worth. End of the day, that’s all that matters....

        ...The other good thing about this film is that the negative characters are not the stereotypical ugh looking ones but smart, suave ones. Freddy Daruwala matches shoulder to shoulder and bicep to bicep with Akshay Kumar and their hand-to-hand combat on the deck of a ship is worth a whistle or two. The always dependable Govinda gives us comic relief as well.  
Watch this one. It’s total paisa vasool...

        ...In other words, the star’s image had a lot to do with our perception of Thuppakki, and without that particular star, the film’s flaws stand out in sharp relief. Akshay Kumar is a good action hero, a good comedian, probably better than Vijay in both these departments, but he doesn’t have what Vijay has, a unique image – he’s a rather generic presence in his films. When he does the “mass moment” scenes, they don’t send a frisson through us, the way they would when these moments are enacted by popular stars with a strong image. He cannot carry a bad film. His films are good if the writing/directing is good, and here, these aspects are far from satisfactory. Holiday, like Thuppakki, is too long. The romantic track (with Sonakshi Sinha) is too bland, too sexist, too redundant. The emotional beats are weak – we aren’t invested enough in the characters to chew our nails over their fate. Murugadoss told me, in an interview recently, that in his remakes (like Ghajini) he fixes the problems in the original film. Didn’t he think these were problems? Or is the real problem the fact that there’s no Aamir Khan this time around?...

          Watched "Holiday: A Soldier Is Never Off Duty." The action sequences are good but the film is definitely not up to the mark!!

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.If this film is a frame by frame remake of the original, Thuppakki - which it probably will be, because Murugadoss has directed both - then I can tell you that it is a story that had potential, but was written out and treated so moronically that I suffered from temporary brain damage. At least the Tamil film had Vidyut Jamwal as villain, and he has a magnetic screen presence. The villain of the Hindi remake seems like a softie in comparison.@Pradeep Thank you! Now I am really looking forward to watching this :/@Pradeep Well, wiki confirms your assumption :)The worst part in such films is the absence of real actors who can play villains... nowadays the villains also are the same as the heroes, well groomed non-actors... the hunks with powerful family backing gets to be the hero... rest become villains...@Jitadiya sad, i know.Terrible. Filmmakers treat audience as shit. Ceep jokes, terrible cinematography, direction, screenplay.Waste of time. Shame.Direction: 2    Story: 2.5    Lead Actors: 2    Character Artists: 2    Dialogues: 2    Screenplay: 2    Music Director: 0.5    Lyrics: 0.5Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.

Violence: Lots. A little gruesome too.
Language: Clean
Nudity & Sexual content: None really, a couple of near kisses?
