For once, a film made me wish it didn't have a story and was the usual Salman Khan "cool". That, at least I'm prepared for. The attempt at putting in sorry, convoluted twists just kill whatever other fun you could have had."More of the same" I can whine and cry my heart out, but some Salman Khan enthusiasts can dance with joy at the prospect of watching "more of the same" from him. Movies such as these are beyond reviews and opinions for die-hard fans. 
But the Salman-cynic in me has something to look forward to. Yes, you read that right. One, I liked Salman's last film, Ready a lot more than I expected to (that's not saying much, even so). So who knows, I might just find something to like in the film. For example, Kareena Kapoor can be pretty good at comic timing if the director wishes so. 
Also, usually no one expects a story from a film in this genre of action comedy. But, I was surprised by this still that tells a story by itself. 

You can tell that Salman Khan is nervous and Kareena Kapoor is pretty amused by this nervousness. It tells me that I can look forward to some decent acting too. 
Don't worry, these little things won't make my hopes too high. Because for every positive thing that I can come up with, the trailer surely has something that will make me roll my eyes. 

"mujhpar ek ehsaan karna, ki mujhpar koi ehsaan na karna" (Do me a favor, that you never do me a favor.) Are you trying to confuse me so well that I don't know whether to do you a favor or not? (For the uninitiated, that is a Dabangg) 
Anyway, I think this one will be another festival for Salman Khan fans and for non-believers like me, there might just be a thing here and a thing there to keep us amused. If not, it's always fun to be amongst a bunch of people who love their Salman Khan films.

  Bodyguard's last half hour constantly reminded me of a Chinese curse. 
May your wish be granted.
I had wished for a story in a Salman Khan film and I got it. And there was so much story stuffed into those 30 minutes that I was praying for it to be over. And it refused, as if taunting me, "you wanted story, you take story! And here take some more."

Fortunately, maybe, all is not lost for Salman Khan fans. There are at least three action packed sequences with slick moves. But somehow, a lot of the credit will be taken by the camera and editing for the "coolness".
The rest of the time though, he plays the squeaky clean, Lovely Singh. The romance he's involved in drags forever and has a climax that you can laugh out your heart at - not in a good way. And the exact same laughter is brought about every time Salman Khan breaks into a song. No rhyme, no reason, just been a while since the audience has seen Salman Khan move his muscles, so let's edit a song in. The supposedly comic scenes on the other hand barely bring a smile or two. At other times, they bring cringes, especially when the "comic relief" side-kick comes on screen. 
The one thing that I found amusing above all is that Salman Khan is being played around at the hands of a woman. Otherwise, usually the women are thrown around as if they have no brains and are helpless at the hands of their men. That doesn't mean Kareena Kapoor gets a chance to have a pathbreaking performance. She does her usual pretty-young-thing bit, only she gets a little more screen time than otherwise accorded to a non-Salman-Khan in a Salman Khan film. 
Usually, for a film where only the star of the film matters, I have a disclaimer that the review doesn't apply to the star's fans. But, I doubt even hardcore Salmaniacs will enjoy Bodyguard either. The star however is confident as ever and has a "I can get away with anything" attitude. 
A dialogue in the film goes, "tumhaari nazar mein tum hero, hamari nazar mein hum hero" (According to you, you are the hero. According to me, I am the hero). Who would have thought a Salman Khan film could be introspective.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Lovely Singh (Salman Khan) is Divya's (Kareena Kapoor). She doesn't want a bodyguard lurking around her all the time. She finds a way out while he is busy saving her life.Lovely Singh (Salman Khan) is Divya's (Kareena Kapoor). She doesn't want a bodyguard lurking around her all the time. She finds a way out while he is busy saving her life.
I was surprised at the ultra-simple titles. They worked compared to the inartistic, non-thematic stuff that go with titles these days.
Divya's dressing style.
The name of the town - Jaysingpur. It's a town 3 hours from Pune where a part of my family stays! Brought a smile.
Raj Babbar's voice.

Total lack of continuity in terms of clothes, etc. Especially during fight sequences.
The last fight sequence when Salman Khan gets hold of Mahesh Manjrekar. A huge jump there in the edit, where positions of the characters change suddenly. 
The mistaken identity bit when Lovely Singh enters Jaysingpur.
The jokes on midgets and obese people were in bad taste
Plush rooms reserved for caretakers and bodyguards.
The childish pranks Divya plays on Lovely Singh.
The weird visuals in the 'desi beat' song. Especially a Black and White Salman Khan running in slo-mo in what looked like rain. 
No worries @Rachit. There are a few problems with watching the South Indian version. Most of them don't have sub-titles. And the other is time. If I'd start a regional section, i'd want to cover as many films in that region as possible. But that will be next to impossible.@Dattaprasad glad to bring a laugh! :D :D :D@Shashank i hear ya!that bad, huh?Bodyguard is a awesome movie.its a superhit movie and all songs are very good  watch this movie in watch-hindi-movies comThanks for saving me time, money and dissapointment.Hahaha, nicely written. Loved the dialogue you quoted and the last line.Sigh! I had liked the trailer :(@Vishal heart-felt sympathies.@Sandy yep!@deepu oh well...i'm surprised it too so long for a Salman fan to leave a comment here :D@Nemoneyaware any time!@kunal thank you! I was hoping readers would appreciate it :)@Chintan so did you see the movie?Wow! what a wonderful dialogue..awesome, too good :D@Keerthana :D :D :D@Khwaja really?@Milind that among many other questions.Awesome review...superbad movie:-(arey yar Salman is just Salman...i just went and enjoyed the action, music and whole hall and whistles in a multiplex....nvr had such an amazing experience in any of the multiplex in India.....i enjoyed the whole atmosphere...moreover i wasnt expecting anythng serious from salman....Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
