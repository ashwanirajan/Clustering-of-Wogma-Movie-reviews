Talaash is more an emotional drama than a thriller. This mixing of genre works but only towards the climax. Through the first half though I found myself pushing myself to like the film. It stays at 'just a good film' when it could've been so much more.Talaash is easily the most looked forward to film this year. While I'd have put Gangs of Wasseypur up there, but this one has a combination of names that makes you sit up and notice. I loved director, Reema Kagti's narration style and wit in Honemoon Travels Pvt Ltd and her story/screenplay in Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara. I'm already looking forward to Zoya Akhtar's next film after Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, who has penned Talaash's story with Reema Kagti. And they've brought in Farhan Akhtar and Anurag Kashyap for the dialogue! How could you not get excited, even if momentarily?And then you top it off with the cast. Call me 'psuedo-cool' if you wish, but seeing Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Raj Kumar Yadav in the trailers got me more excited than Aamir Khan and Kareena Kapoor. I really do want my characters to make to me forget who is playing them. And that isn't happening at least in the trailers where these two are concerned. Especially, at the points where Aamir Khan gets all intense and on the verge of being angry, which seems to be throughout.Rani Mukerji, however has blended in wonderfully. You don't even notice her at 1:20 in this video.And that is what I have always liked her for. In any case, I desperately need to rid myself of the aftertaste that Aiyyaa left.In addition, you have a thriller which looks like it has a decent dose of relationships and personal dilemmas thrown in. I sure hope the intrigue the trailers have built in the story is maintained in the film in the proportion that a story of this genre demands. For once, the genres seem to be mixing well with each other. And I come back to the awesome combinations that Talaash carries. To round it up nicely we have lyrics by Javed Akhtar set to music by Ram Sampath.Music Reviews:
Milliblog - "The Aamir Khan – Ram Sampath combination continues to rock after Delhi Belly; Talaash’s soundtrack is short, but enchantingly deft!"
Music Aloud - "8/10"
dunkdaft - "Talaash has a pretty good mix of tunes for the thriller. It surely will be perfect on the screen. (But somewhere, it left me wanting for more. Or maybe, its just me, over-wanting, cause Aamir is there.)"
Hindustan Times - "there’s too much electronica in it — but it’s worth a listen"
Bollyspice - "3/5"
Apun Ka Choice - "3/5"

  Talaash springs in a surprise. Not in a thriller sort-of a way. But by being more about its characters than the overall story. You don't really expect a film about a mysterious accident to be much more about how deeply damaged the protagonists are and how each one is trying to bring peace to the soul within. Given that, you still come out feeling you didn't know the characters well enough. Talaash leans too heavily on the typical assumptions you are going to make about characters given their situations. A stern police officer who has lost a dear one will behave in a particular manner. A mourning young mother is  forlorn. It gives you this much in the first few minutes and adds no more. And a lot of what goes on in the story that these characters weave together is known from the promos itself. Yet again, the promos, and overall marketing in general, of a film takes expectations in a different direction, a direction that is detrimental to the film. It is sort-of cheating calling Talaash a thriller or even a psychological thriller. For want of a better phrase let me coin 'emotional thriller' which seems to fit the bill better. Had the trailers and synopsis hinted towards the heavy emotional bent to the film, I wouldn't have spent the first half looking for the thrill. And once again, I realise how little weight the pre-release material of a film deserves. Lesson learnt.Anyways, once I figured that Talaash isn't really going to bring the thrill in a hurry, I settled down to the pace of the film. Slowly, the pace grows on you even though the story it unfolds never ever really grips you from the core. This is mainly due to the many threads opened in the first half. Is it about the accident/murder? Is it about a police officer's personal trauma? Is it about his wife's mental health? Is it about the prostitutes and their palpable conditions? Is it about an enigmatic prostitute? Well, it ends up being about all of them, but the pieces don't come together seamlessly. Also, it constantly felt like they wanted to keep things subtle but got scared into spelling things out, just in case the audience doesn't 'get it'. I do understand, a thriller needs to send its audience off in many directions to keep them distracted from what's really happening. But, the weightage each of these threads gets in the first half, does injustice to all of them. None of the sub-plots take you deeper into the characters or their situations. They all stay at a superficial level. What actually keeps you going are the performances. For a change, Aamir Khan is more Surjan Shekhawat than Aamir Khan. The only times I was reminded of the star was when he addressed his superior who looked younger than him as 'Sir'. It just felt off. To director, Reema Kagti's credit, the film is not overwhelmed by his presence. Or that of Kareena Kapoor's. She plays the teasing prostitute who has a mysterious aura about her with elegance. Rani Mukerji has a short but powerful presence. On the other hand, Raj Kumar Yadav and Nawazuddin Siddiqui entertain and create intrigue respectively. I still would prefer seeing them in films that are more about their characters.And as far as the twist in the tale goes, you can make a fair guess from the promos, a guess that is confirmed about 20 minutes into the second half. But it is pretty cool that you are still a little away from the whole truth. What I found amusing is that had this been a non-Indian film, the 'whole truth' would have been apparent a lot earlier. Now before I relent to the temptation of naming one particular psychological thriller from Hollywood that will give the movie away, let me move away from the twist. Yet, this is what won me over. I have always enjoyed stories that have a climax that gives the film more meaning than what it seemed about. In clarification, many films lose the plot in the last half hour and take away everything that they had build up till then. Whereas Talaash takes the entire goose chase to a deeper level. A level I hadn't seen coming mainly because I didn't think I'd see it in a Hindi film. I'm so used to disconnected dots staying so in films we generate. Unfortunately, the chase is rendered pretty much pointless, because it is not about the apparent chase at all. Talaash is a game of hide-and-seek that characters play with themselves. It is more an emotional tale of a police officer, a responsible father's need for catharsis, about the closure he deserves. Which is why, it seems like a film that could have meant so much more. That could have connected so much more deeply than just having a funky climax, that uses voice-overs of scenes we saw earlier to spoon-feed us.Also, doesn't a film talking about such philosophical, psychological and emotional stuff need much more profound and powerful dialogue? All this one has is dialogue that are too obviously metaphorical. So, despite performances that make stars look like humans, despite some awesome production design and camera-work, despite having potential to play tricks on the mind that the audience would enjoy figuring out, despite being more than what is obvious, Talaash remains just a good film.

It’s a little like going in to watch Die Hard and complaining that Bruce Willis never dies.

amithel:
          Talaash-the performances stay on in the viewer's mind-great feat in the midst of the  claustrophobic I, Me, Myself clutter of today's stars.
        
aiyeshabahadur:
          You never cease to amaze me Aamir, brilliant acting #Talaash

aankinandu:

yakuzazoomin:

vandnasathpathy:
          #Talaash - Was hooked to the movie until the last 20mins, and then, Meh.
        
vams21:
          Talaash is good but not Amir khan-esque ..
        
thatdarkcoffee:
          Talaash is a good movie, just packaged wrongly.
        
OctaneAddict:
          Talaash is an ok-movie. Once watch. IMHO
        
nitinma:
          Talash = very very average! 2.5/5..
        
Nikxatrix:
          Somehow felt tht d CID episode Aamir starrd in had a much better suspense n more brain tickling stuff. One time watch strictly this #Talaash
        
Nickoholic:
          There R sadists in this world who like to give out a movie's suspense jus cuz they have diarrhoea &cant keep it in.Still,Talaash was alright
        
namral:
          #Talaash was gripping till the end. I wish the twist was not so lame !
        
libraspace:
          'Talaash' one time watch,  kareena in movie one more time watch
        
HiteshMamtora:
          Some how had more expectation out of Talaash!
        
HansPiyush:
          Talaash ? 1 time watch.
        
daredevilakshay:
          Talaash could have been faster in pace. If only it was released as a book. Could have been more engaging.
        
AratiRaval:
          Expectations are funny. Talaash mainly disappointed becoz of Aamir. Had Akshay Kumar done it, I would've celebrated his 'waking up' moment
        
AliSaif777:
          Talaash is only good till there's suspense once it opens up the story is Jusstttt #Pathetic
        
_aasiyah:
          another disappointing bollywood movie.. #talaash #backtotheclassics #oldisgold
        
VB_VinayBajaj:
          Anyone who respects their time and money should not go for Talaash !!!
        
varundlima:
          #Talaash is #destroyed!! Poor #Amir.
        
TheAnkitPatel:
          TALASH is a wonderful as a sleeping pills..))))#jthj #srk @iamsk
        
Tanumoyd:
          They Say- " #Talaash is not for the masses as it is a class film or multiplex film". Ghanta ka class film. It was a Horror-Comedy. LOL.
        
swathq:
          people said #talaash is not a bad movie, i'd like to add its not a good one either.....
        
shridutt:
          u Knw the suspense of talash before u watch it...u may have been cursed by yash Chopra if u hav criticised jab tak. Hain jaan
        
ShootinStarHeta:
          Talaash is the best flop movie I've watched this year
        
shakwrites:
          Predictability killed Talaash. Befitting way to justify the plot was clear disbelief in coincidences. Something our makers are yet to master
        
shaan65:
          Talaash a totally crap one...bakwaas movie...no one can talaash entertainment in it...
        
sanjaymanjrekar:
          Talash - amongst other things we must learn to tell our story in a shorter time.
        
sanidhya:
          #Talaash Felt like i was talaashing something else. Expected better from Aamir. Serious let down #flop #bad
        
saff62:
          I totally agree RT @IMmaheshg: after seeing #Talaash.......my respect for ACP Praduman has increased ...manifolds....
        
rupat83:
          Weekend also got boring wid Talaash,slow movie,it's only bcoz of big star cast,otherwise it's total flop #pakao
        
reemsaied:
          #Talaash searching for entertainment. Poor multiplex users who coughed up 500+ per couple. Movie is like a tv production
        
raj_narpat:
          Talaash muve flop
        
Rajsoldier:
          Talaash is a mixture of three hollywood
movies...well done aamir. once again u
proved dat u r the biggest copy cat of B
Town !
        
prathameshpmore:
          Aamir Khan ki Talash Dekhne se achha hota main Akshay Kumar ki Talash dekh leta :|
        
OyeMaria:
          Watched Talaash. WHY Aamir Khan, WHY WHY WHAAAIIIII! did you do this to us :-|
        
NinadKarpe:
          Saw TALAASH. Disappointed.
        
nikkhils:
          Talaash - what a letdown! Looks like Aamir himself was not convinced with the mumbo-jumbo and that reflects in his below-par acting as well
        
Nerdacholic:
          #Talaash A movie that can give you sleepless nights, thinking about the mistakes they have done in the film.
        
Neeli_Peeli:
          #Talaash was horrible and it would have been worse if Kareena wasn't there! so its a #ThumbsDown
        
naitikrocks12:
          Talaash a very bad film....didnt expect such movie from aamir khan..a complete waste of time...movie...
        
MyShortOpinions:
          If you didnt piece the clues beforehand you would enjoy the movie but for me it was trying too hard to be like a hollywood movie. #Talaash
        
MyselfSuz:
          The #Talaash plot is not what I expect from stalwarts like Reema Kagti or Zoya Akhtar though Farhan Akhtar producing it can be understood.
        
MissPeepToes:
          Talaash is a silly movie. Very silly #ThereISaidIt
        
mandy_dhanoa:
          Amir you dissapointed me in Talash plus I learnt being civil to others is creepy apparently LOL
        
KunalOxBhatia:
          Did I mention that I found Talaash below average? Disappointing from Aamir.
        
Kulbhushanmehta:
          I have watched film ''Talaash'' before 1 days and this is why I have given 1 star to film. It's another version of film ''kahaani''
        
Keeda_:
          Life of pi was a visual treat... Bt talaash turned to be a visual cheat...:-/
        
karthikacr:

KapurRia:

kamaalrkhan:
          The best thing is tat public is in mood to watch films so even ghatiya films r doing gud business otherwis #Talaash would hav been disaster.
        
JustJuning:
          Trying to understand the logic behind making a film like #Talaash
        
IMmaheshg:
          after seeing #Talaash.......my respect for ACP Praduman has increased ...manifolds....

hardiksheth1992:
          Talaash is a boring movie... very superficial... not at all The Aamir Khan movie... was a letdown....

Chaitali_Karnik:
          So tempted to blurt out the #talaash plot just so that I can atleast save some souls from this ghastly movie. Pun intended.
        
Broadchrome:
          Aamir Khan caught in the wrong movie. #Talaash
        
binaykol:
          #Talaash biggest disaster of 2012..

9nehak:
          I am surprised at the reviewers giving a rating of 4 to #Talaash. The end totally spoilt it for me. I am surprised @aamir_khan did this!

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Warning: this section has some details that could distort your experience while watching the movie. I strongly recommend reading this only after you have seen the movie or if you have decided not to see it.A mysterious accident is being investigated by an officer who is going through a lot in his personal life. Both problems find solution through the appearance of one character. A mysterious accident is being investigated by an officer who is going through a lot in his personal life. Both problems find solution through the appearance of one character. 
The many shots typical of Mumbai real life barely ever captured on reel.
Raj Kumar Yadav and Aamir Khan speaking Marathi. Found it amusing. 
Inclusion of issues like AIDS, sex-workers' plight, and even seemingly smaller things like entire family wearing helmets when riding a bike and use of seatbelts in cars. 
Interestingly, there were no corrupt police officers in the entire film. 
I found it slightly amusing that Aamir Khan's character asks his team to keep the details of the case under covers, just like real life Aamir Khan likes to keep his projects. 
The scene in which the emotional disconnect between Suri (Aamir Khan) and his wife Roshni (Rani Mukerji) is depicted by their souls (reflections(?)) wanting to hug.
The chemistry between Aamir Khan and Raj Kumar Yadav. Worked really well.
The ease with which Kareena Kapoor corners Aamir Khan. Yeah, one of the places where the actors who played the characters came to attention more than the characters even though the actors were performing well. 
The depiction of the many alternate possibilities that a mind goes through.
The way Aamir Khan breathes shortly whenever memories of his son are triggered.
The two long sequences between Suri and Rosy (Kareena Kapoor) post-interval. Their lingering long gazes worked big time even though these scenes slowed down the pace of the film by many notches.
A tribute (maybe accidental or I read too much) to Shaan's 'yaa ali' where a cripple's board is used by a character who is very similar to Shaan's Abdul. 
The mild thrill brought about by the chase sequence the above scene features in. 
It is mentioned in passing, but I really liked the way both Shashi (through his girlfriend/wife) and Temur think they've done a lot for the other but the other hasn't taken care of them. 
WARNING This one could be thought of as a spoiler compared to the other points above. Two questions - Why does Temur (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) go to Rosy for help? An injured Rosy is brought to Temur's house by Shashi - what is the relevance of this scene in the context of what is going on in the film at that point? And what happens after that in terms of the plot?

The use of one of Sholay's  tunes (mostly in first half). That one belongs more in a western than a tale in an urban setting.
The teasing. For example, the one which tries to create an angle between Mrs. Kapoor and her husband's friend Kejriwal
Shernaz Patel's character. It's too caricaturish, out of place for this film. 
Where was Temur (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) sitting when he exchanges the SIM cards? Jail? Wouldn't he want to run away from the Jail as soon as he gets a chance? The ambiguity bothered me throughout the scene. 
Dialogue given to a 8-year old are too adult-like in language. 
@Lil well yeah, that was unfortunate, it'd have been fun to have a discussion here. My inbox was getting flooded with spam comments to the tune of 20000 a day. Anyway, they are back again and hope it'll stay that way.I totally disagree with you Meetu. Aamir Khan looked exactly same as he looks in Satymev Jayte. Direction is horribly poor. Story is half-baked, I suspect it's lifted from some Spanish or Mexican movie. The kids' accident scene, for an honest police inspector, it would be a sky in the pie to find such a no-person-around place in India or anywhere. The only person who impressed me was Rani Mukherji. She was wonderful. I don't think that any money was spent on the production, probably producer didnt have much after paying Aamir and Kareena. I am posting my comments after many months, because I don't want to spend my money on Indian movies, I dont think they are worth. I got this DVD at my town's library, so thought to give it a try. I was disappointed.@Kuldeep oh that's sad. I wonder if the hype created contributes to a person disliking a film. Just wondering generally.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
