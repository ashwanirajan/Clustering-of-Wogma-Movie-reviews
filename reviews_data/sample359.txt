
wogma rating: Watch when on TV/online (?) - As usual, this rating doesn't apply to Salman Khan fans.
    
  A social "do good" injection doesn't dent Salman-ness of the film. A Salman Khan film is a Salman Khan film is a Salman Khan film, right? There are barely any other way for Salman Khan film to be. Of course, I cannot deny that Tabu's inclusion, that too as his sister, has piqued my interest ever-so slightly. But only, by so much.Sigh. We'll go, we'll watch, and we'll sigh. Music Reviews:

  He may be a cop, a thief, a spy, a bodyguard or a buffoon - He's Salman Khan and he'll beat people around him to pulp. He'll do it to the cheers and whistles of his audience. He'll do it with his unique style that you can hate or love, but cannot ignore even if you tried. Oh yes, they try to have a story in Jai Ho which attempts to ignite the human in you.So, here's our good samaritan (yeah, that's how good he is) Jai (Salman Khan) who helps people and wants to spread his idea of goodness. Only that he is hot-tempered, so his help invariably involves violence. A lot of violence. I guess, being a Salman Khan film we should just be thankful that this time around the character he plays isn't looting the rich to help the poor, to give his character that shade of grey. There I go again, looking for work in the writing department in a film of this genre, having this star. However, I did like that they try to propagate the "do good, feel good" idea. If only, the movie stuck to it, itself. Unless of course, the idea of a common man beating every criminal in sight - is "do good". Aah, now there's an idea. And yet, when a military tanker vandalizes property, it gets a bit much, even if it is out of goodness of the heart, for the goodness of the heart.I must admit though, for a change Jai Ho has more focused writing than any of Salman's recent films. It doesn't deviate from its theme or violence, but for that occasional song and dance number. It doesn't take the romantic detour for too long too. Even the villains want to harass his other family members rather than his love interest. Which is about as good as it gets, for to see Tabu play a side character hurts. She stands tall, she tries to bring composure to the film, she does her bit, but it still hurts. I felt sorry for Genelia D'Souza too. Maybe her character too, but mostly the actor for the length of the character she plays. It is very difficult to no relate it to her post-marriage career. Anyway, lead lady Daisy Shah is the quintessential pretty, dumb love interest who does her bit of cutesy and is "out of sight, out of mind" for the other characters, writers, and the audience. The only actor who actually gives a performance-performance is Naman Jain who plays Salman Khan's nephew. Not only is he cute, he is confident and delivers his lines with perfect timing. Also, his role is written well - doesn't make him sound like an adult but at the same time keeping him in line with any boisterous child of this day and age would talk.Otherwise, Jai Ho is the typical mix of action, silly humor, romance, loud background score, and ill-placed mediocre songs. Though, "baaki sab first class hai" does have decent lyrics. Too little to hang on to for a film that last 2.5 hours.Throughout the film, I just couldn't shake off the fact that Salman Khan is calling himself a common man. Oh, it's the character that's the common man? Yeah right! Even for the sake of argument, if you ignore that Salman plays Salman in the film, how can you ignore not every common man or a common woman's brother has six packs and muscle power to take down 20 people in one go. And without that, how do we do good and spread the word?

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.jai ho is salman best best movie .........great for tabbu and ok okUffff.... with a review like this - you are going to have to deal with a major fan of Salman, called Anuj.Good luck. ;-)@Fan:The Salman Khan does not need any defending,does he? ;) Unfortunately,this movie will go the Dabangg-2 way! Fantastic at single screens but a below average performer at plexes. Its astronomical price will ensure only an Average+/Semi Hit tag for its distributors. This one is definitely not a universal entertainer like a Dabangg or Ek Tha Tiger!Terribly disappointed with your rating.. Was expecting "Watch if you have nothing better to do".. :(This is a welcome movie from salmaan,,,,,with a decent plot(Almost copied from STALIN) sohain khan has attempt good and made a decent movie which could have been alot better if executed well.....There is a predictable plot - comedy then song then fighting then again comedy then again song and then again fighting,,,,with a good social msg between them.....But the good thing is that the social msg doesnt left the plot ever,,,,and u will take msg with u in ur heart.....Then again feel bad for genelia , sunil settgy and ofcoarse tabu in such small roles and sidekicks....But at the end this one is alot better then Ready , Bodyguard , Ek tha Tiger and Dabang 2 and Sohail khan can make better movies as compared to Arbaaz khan.....The reports so far seem to be by and large positive at least from the single screens and B/C centres.The below par beginning at the multiplexes has certainly ensured that this will not scale the heights of Dabangg,Bodyguard and ETT.In all probability the pattern of this movie will be ditto like 2009's Wanted which too was a bumper hit at single screens but a below par performer at multiplexes.Interesting point to be noted is,among all of Salman's blockbusters in the last 4 years,its moderate hits like Wanted and now Jai Ho that seem to be carrying the best word of mouth among the mass audiences,a lot higher then Bodyguard and ETT.Dabangg(2010) of course was at a different level courtesy its acceptance across both the single screens as well as the plexes....somebody once complained...the problem with dhoom 3 is that they didn't showed the process of bank robbing...they only showed chase sequence...and I was left wondering how much spoon feeding do we expect from our movies ...got the answer with this movie...the one line theory...which is probably inspired by some chit fund company...is hammered 30 times in the movie....till you are numb ..just so that you should not forget ...they even made a song ...good thing about the movie is the dumb actress ...she makes even Salman look smart ...and that's an achievement...the movie couldn't do even half of d3 or k3 's opening day business...it proves that literacy rate of India is going up...its now just a matter of time...moment there are enough bpo jobs available in saanpada, bhahalpur and bhatkal..his online fan base will start doing something which their parent will be proud of...as for him...their are enough revital, relaxo and extra muesli companies...Happy Republic Day. This has more thumbs up than the last 4 Salman K starrers but seriously speaking box office has always been a game of  chess where the players (the theatreaudience) always gauge the prevailing atmosphere and select what suits their state of relaxation and entertainment. Many factors have contributed to success at the cash registers, nowadays rich actors, so called superstars armtwist their way into doing lead roles in film genres that are in favour with audiences with support from big banners (higher centres) to cash in on audience gullibility eg  Ek Tha Tiger, Ra.One and Dhoom and many others.   The audience can be fooled every month but definitely not by the same set of people.Jai Ho opens at 17.15 cr .Salman Khan in and as JAI agniHOtri.Even Besharam a film of low anticipation took   a better opening figure than this.Audience apparently rates this better than   Lungi Express, Kaal 3 & Illusion 3.  Means there is some commercial hope for Kick.Imagine a film, where the hero bites three persons and these 3 persons three more persons each and form a chain of cannibals.For all the worthless so-called literate audiences (aka pseudo intellectual dumbasses of the first grade),stop worrying about the fate of Salman Khan. For a guy whose delivered career biggest hits in HAHK,MPK and HSSH and cult films in Tere Naam and HDDCS,making a switch over from mass entertainment to romance/family dramas is a piece of cake! In fact rumour goes that he's soon teaming up with Sooraj Barjatya himself. Now i'd love to see the faces of these dumb,brainless cinematic illiterate maggots when that releases!PS: This pseudo brigade tends to show their ugly face only when a Salman mass entertainer releases! Wonder where these braindead dimwits hibernate when their so-called "thinking actor"(who apparently has himself gone overboard promoting Jai Ho to the extent of posting pics of the 2 so-called friends peeing together on twitter) does a Ghajini or a Raja Hindustani or a Fanaa or a Dhoom-3!Its not a rumour ,, but its fixed that salmaan has been selected on barjatiya’s nxt,,,,,,and he will return as PREM on the screen,,,,,which is actually a good thing,,,,,But its not like the Aamir havnt swt over into different genres in hus career,,,,infact Salmaan do moreover same types of movies,,,,,,and why only count salmaan’s hit movies,,,,why dont anyone see how many flops he had given,,,,before wanted he was even searching for a small hit in bollywood,,,no one was interested in watching ,, helli , mr and mrs khanna , yuvraj etc ,, the number if flops are much more of salmaan then aamir......And for the primotion factor what aamir is doing for salmaan is only as a return because salmaan has promoted Dhoom alot spending all the Saturdays and Sundays on bigboss saying ’Dhoom machale Dhoom machale’ wearing the cap given by aamir to him........Even they too are frnds now,,,,but there supporters can never be frnds....Imo,stardom and popularity is not judged by the number of flops u give. Its judged by the number of hits and more importantly the magnitude of hits that an actor gives viz top annal grossers,biggest hits of the decade etc. Salman's got 8 annual top grossers which is 3 more than Aamir and Srk. He's got a total of around 12 super hit films,4 being Mega hits and of course HAHK is the biggest bollywood hit ever after Sholay (bigger then DDLJ and 3I). Maine Pyaar Kiya was the biggest hit of the decade of the 80's. And the phase you're referring to,its not that none of his films were popular. For ex.a Tere Naam was an extremely popular film in the interiors and B/C centres with huge footfall and viewership. But unfortunately due to ticket prices being 1/10th that of multiplexes (year 2003) the collections of Tere Naam couldn't really elevate itself beyond a certain level. Same goes for Garv,Har Dil Jo Pyaar Karega or even a terrible film like Lucky-No time for love! Of course he did have super hits like No Entry,Partner and Mujhse Shaadi Karogi in that era too!Salman's hits in various genres :ROMANCE : Maine Pyaar Kiya,Saajan,Hum Aapke...,Hum Dil De Chuke...ACTION : Karan Arjun,Wanted,Dabangg,Ek Tha Tiger(action/romance),Bodyguard(action/romance)FAMILY DRAMA : Hum Aapke...,Hum Saath Saath HainCOMEDY : Biwi No.1,Mujhse Shaadi Karogi,Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya,No Entry,Partner,ReadyTRAGEDY : Tere Naam,Hum Dil De Chuke..(second half)CRITICALLY ACCLAIM FOR THE PSEUDO CLASSES & HYPOCRITES : Phir Milenge :PAnything left?Ya thats right leave the number of flops and check only hits,,,,,its like even a child have fail 4 times in a class ,,,,if he have got 80% fifth time he is the most brillient student in the class,,,,great analysis again......And which of these genre havnt been done by amir or srk or even akhshay or ajay or any other actor.....If u pic any khan or there age of actors,,,,they all have done movies in all these genre,,,,,we are talking about switching genre,,,,,and salmaan does the same genre of movies again and again,,,,m thankfull to barjatiya who have thought of taking salmaan again,,,,because is the best director who could pull out the best of salmaan khan ...... My own best movie of salmaan khan is Hum Saath Saath Hein,,,,i dont think that character of prem could have been done better as compared to what salmaan had done.....I dont hate salmaan i have the movies what he choose to make.....That only after dabang first....Before that i was also interested in salmaan’s movie.....But after that he is just making same movies,,,nothing new in any one of them,,,,even actresses and villains are repeated in the movies.....All the movies are hit because of popularity of salmaan and the promotion he does,,,,And look what happen to jai ho when less promotion is done for the movie,,,infact the movie is better then the last four of him......Yes salmaan is the most popular actor of bollywood in recent time ,,,, thats why hr should not make movies hit on his popularity,,,he should make different genre of movies for different taste of people,,,,,,the nxt barjatiya movie will definayly be welcomed by me......@Anup : Even if these genre's have been done by the likes of Ajay and Akshay,their films have never been as popular as Salman films,nowhere near them in fact! As for Aamir and Srk,MPK>QSQT,HAHK>DDLJ>Raja Hindustani,Biwi No.1>>Duplicate,Dabangg>Ghajini>OSO...as for comparison about biggest hits,HAHK>3I,DDLJ,MPK>CE,Raja Hindustani!! PS : Salman never failed 4 times. He's the only actor in Indian cinematic history to give a decade biggest hit (MPK) in his 2nd films itself and have 2 all time blockbuster's in his first 5 years of his career. A lot of those flops in the 2000's were goodwill gestures towards pals and relatives (same goes for Dabangg-2 and Jai Ho). Comparing non stars like Akshay and Ajay with Salman is a laughable exercise while SRK,Aamir & Hrithik are still behind him in terms of mass popularity!On the topic of Republic Day and Jai Ho,here are my favourite patriotic movies in bollywood!http://bollyindiaboxoffice.blogspot.in/2014/01/happy-republic-day-my-favourite.htmlCinema was never for poor men and will never be, why not try free tickets across uniplex, duplex and multiplex and count footfalls.   Those people watching at single screens are not poor, it is just a way of saying your film is worth watching on the big screen only for a certain amount.Dedh Ishiya tops hindi film box office in its second week with 6.4cr and targets a 25.5cr lifetime due to boycotting of the youth oriented film.@ehinome:Idiotic,arrogant self obsessed rich duffer of the first grade that you are i obviously do not expect you to understand the fact that 80% of the Indian population cannot "afford" to pay 200 bucks per person to watch a movie at a multiplex or shell out 800 bucks to watch it at an Imax screen. But yes its definitely a lot more affordable to spend anywhere between 80-100 bucks to watch the same film at a single screen. As for Dedh Ishqiya,its a box office disaster that will not even end up with a lifetime of 30 cr while its cost is INR 35 cr approx. The rejected Yaariyan will end p at 35 made at a cost of 20 cr. Suck on that and kindly refrain from making 22 comments at once,'coz if i start stating facts a dimwitted noob like yourself is gonna be pants to his nickers!"Cinema was never for poor men and will never be, why not try free tickets across uniplex, duplex and multiplex and count footfalls."~food,water,electricity and shelter was never for the poor man and will never be! Why not inflate the prices of all these commodities and let the poor go die in hell? Ha...what a retard!!@Anuj- Marigold- an adventure in india , god tussi great ho , heroes and yuvraj,,,,4 flops then comes Wanted which was a hit......@Anuj - u know i dont want to fight with u , because i m not a person who blindly follow an actor what ever he made,,,,even i criticise amir khan when i dont like his movie....I dont know whether u are satisfied with salmaan’s movie or not,,,,because u dont ever talk about how the movie is,,,,u always talk about how much a movie has grossed,,,,or u will say the grossing of the movie is the only thing that matters to u that its meaningless for me to talk to u.....Because it doesnt matter how much more ready or body guard or dabang 2 has grossed they are not good movies as compared to rang de basanti or taare zameen par.....Because my frnd high grossing doesnt prove that a movie is good,,,it only proves that the actor is popular,,,,,and m not atall denying that salmaan is the most popular actor in india.....See the link of patriotic movies u have given,,,it has total 9 movies,,,,which actually contains 2 movies of nassirudin shah and 3 movies of aamir khan,,,,,the two actors whom u criticise most.......Thats what i m saying,,,,,salmaan have given many hits toi bollywood,,,,but as compared to aamir there are very few movies of salmaan which will be remembered for many years,....Not denying that there are movies that will be remembered for salmaan but they are very few in numbersss,,,,and salmaan should concentrate on that,,,,not just making high grossing mivies,,,and Jai Ho is good for the start.....Now see what salmaan himself saying about masala genre,,,,what actually i was saying 2 months before and u were denying what i was saying with me -Just before the release of AkshayKumar’s Boss, Salman had said “Thisspace (masala films) will die totally. Ithink this was a beautiful format when wehad films like Wanted, Dabangg etc. Noweverybody has overdone it so much that itmight die away. These kinds of films arepopular but the creativity is becomingless… It seems the same stuff ishappening. I don’t know which genre willclick now,,,,This statement has been taken from the same website which u promote-bollyindiaboxoffice.blogspot.......@Anup:Only today i have put up a list of my favourite patriotic films and have even given the link. It includes flops like Swades,Average fares like Lakshya and non commercial films like A Wednesday! Go through my blog instead of replying to my comments here!@Anuj - i have seen ur blog,,,,right from the first time u promoted it,,,,and it mostly say the same things what u said here....See u have only reply a small.comment of mine not the other things what i have said.....U always do the same thing.....U were asking the genre what havnt been done by salmaan khan,,,,Phycological thriller is one of that genre,,,,which is almost untouched by bollywood before TALAASH of aamir,,,,and again Politics is one of the genre which havnt been done by salmaan ever.....Aamir’s nxt movie is P.K. which is a political satire,,,,Sports is a genre which havnt been done by salmaan,,,,Lagaan was a patriotic Sport movie........Salmaan should try some out of the box movies in bollywood,,,,,......The genres u counted are usual genres of movies,,,,they doenst give different test,,,,movies like those come every 2nd friday in bollywood....Whatever be the genre,whoever be the director,whatever be the era,popularity is only and only about the number of people watching your film and nothing else. In the last 25 years Salman Khan has easily been the most watched actor in bollywood based on footfall and theatrical viewership. For all the Veer's and Marigold's he's the first and only actor to date to have given 5 back to back massive blockbusters in a row,a feat even the great Amitabh Bachchan never achieved. Salman Khan is the only actor to have 2 biggest decade hits to his name in the form of Maine Pyaar Kiya and HAHK. The only actor after Dilip Kumar to have 8 annual top grossers which no other Khan,Bachchan or Roshan has achieved. Now these figures in itself are sufficient to prove him to be the biggest superstar of the generation and the biggest since Amitabh Bachchan. Srk and Aamir might be dominating the overseas market but as i've said before,overseas forms just 2-3% of the total bollywood viewing audience across the globe (mainly the NRI's and folk of Indian origin). Salman Khan is the true superstar of the masses. Its not for nothing that even the Srk/Aamir friendly media has awarded him titles like "Blockbuster Khan","Sellout Superstar" and "Mass Maharaja"!Salman Khan  -  I am the no 1 bhojpuri star in Bollywood and Jai Ho will net 128cr.   Will remake masti kind of films.So u r a person who will never praise aamir’s work,,,and will always praise salmaan’s work doesnt matter actually how bad the movie was,,,,and m a person who will praise good movies ignoring the fact the who have acted in it,,,,good work will always be praised by me,,,thats it,,,,i think the matter between us is solved.....Mahir Fadnavis  -  This is strictly for Shahrukh and Aamir fans as you will have a lot of negative reasons to laugh.  For Salman fans visiting the jail is better than enduring this as it is more like Jail Hole."So u r a person who will never praise aamir’s work,,,and will always praise salmaan’s work doesnt matter actually how bad the movie was"~yeah,no wonder i rate Sarfarosh as one of the greatest patriotic films ever made in bollywood while i rate Lagaan as the greatest sports film in Indian cinema!@ehinome:Dunno about Bhojpuri films,but he's definitely got a massive hard core fanbase in Delhi/UP,Rajasthan,Mumbai,Andhra,Bihar,MP,Jharkhand,Middle East and parts of Europe and US too! But frankly i do not expect dimwitted nincompoops with an IQ level of a snail to acknowledge this. The so-called Bhojpuri star's films are definitely a lot more entertaining than a bloody hakla bakra voiced stammer spreading his arms like film after film for 20 odd years doing the same Karva Chauth-Shaadi Doli brand of transgender cinema with his "friends" and domestic partners. That's something that idiotic,dumb retarded Nri's might fanthom,not us lot!@Anuj- as u said its only one post of urs,,,,,but ur other comments represent different things,,,,u blindly support salmaan ,, thats true,,,,thats what m saying..No i'm n blind fan of Salman but its definitely a fact that he is indeed the most popular superstar of this generation ahead of the other 2 Khans'. My criticism and dissing of AK on this forum has been mainly in response to comments made by jokers like Ehinome who've been repeatedly spamming irrelevant,senseless and dumb comments to prove their non existent point. In fact,I am equally critical of Jai Ho's economics as i was for Dedh Ishqiya. Jai Ho is once again a clear case of a selfish producer filling his coffers by selling this movie at unrealistically high rates to the distributors thereby ensuring that none of the distributors will stand a chance of making profits unless the movie crosses INR 200 cr nett. Even at 140 cr this movie will be an Average grosser and anything less than that,its an outright Flop. Did not expect such hypocrisy from Salman Khan who himself had gone on record criticizing exhibitors' for inflating ticket prices for every major release. Unfortunately Salman has not practiced what he preached,not on this occasion at least!@Fan ha ha ha...doesn't bother me at all. Anyway he has already concluded somewhere, if I remember right, that I will give it either "switch channels if on Cable" or "watch if you have nothing better to do" and if I give it any higher, it is just to appease him! I have nothing to say to someone who has such a, what should I say, well-centered opinion of self.@moviebhakt I know! but I had to lean towards the MLM idea even though I have seen the English film it is based on. It is cute and honestly, the optimist in me feels it can work. Now, if only, it didn't required 6-pack abs and brutally beating people around.@Meetu i dont know how have you rated this movie so high but according to me it is just an average fare.@Anuj I watched this movie yesterday and i was surprise to see the low capacity of crowd even on sunday this surely is a flop may be an average affair whats your say on this.Regarding the fan following even Amir had said that Salman is no 1 in that race but i do completely agree with Anup that he is doing same type of movie over and over again.Though i liked it more than Dhoom 3.Anuj - I have agreed with u on the fact that Salmaan is the most popular actor of bollywood industry,,,,and its impossible to deny it.....@Siddharth "Even the keen, wait for DVD" is not at all a high rating. It is as average as it gets.@Siddharth : Where exactly did u watch this film? 'coz according to reports pouring in,Sunday was massive and there are chances of a 25 cr day! If that's indeed the case,we'll have to wait till Tuesday to observe a clear pattern and make a guess but of what i have heard thus far,die hard Salman fans are giving this movie a better rating than Bodyguard and Dabangg2! So i guess based on sheer word of mouth this one still has chances of breaching the 150 mark which should be enough for a Semi-Hit tag. As i said,this pattern is almost identical to that of Wanted which too is a much more "appreciated" film among the Salman fanbase than Bodyguard and Dabangg2 which mainly collected big purely and purely based on brand Salman Khan and his crowdpulling abilities. Regarding repetition,how exactly are Wanted(mass dialogues+stylized action),Dabangg(crude action entertainer),Ready(comedy),Bodyguard(romantic/action entertainer),ETT(stylized action/romance) and now Jai Ho(social message in an action entertainer) related barring the action elements?@Anuj I watched it at Multiplex in Ghaziabad and we were surprised that it was only half full and i dont know where these 25 cr are coming may be Mumbai :-).I am talking about Dabangg2 which was exact replica of dabaang,bodyguard i really did not like the movie actually i am action movie fan but these types of action just put me off.Wanted and Dabangg are really gud movies may be people wont like me for that but they were entertainer and that is it for me.I think ETT was overrated movie there was so much scope to show him as a Spy but instead they just messed up like Sohail messed this one.I liked Jai ho and all those with me liked it.I like the Hero to beat 40-50 guys but like Wanted,Dabangg,Zinda type where it is raw fight.I dont know about 150 crs but this film is better than Dabangg2,BodyGuard.@Siddharth:What's wrong in liking Wanted and Dabangg.Even i loved both and so did 80% of the viewers' who watched them.Yes i agree they were the 2 best among all Salman's films and the trending of both these films proves the same! Bodyguard,ETT and Dabangg-2 got off to historic initial starts but fizzled out by the time they entered week 2 which clearly indicates a very mixed to below average response. Wanted and Dabangg were holding strong even into their fourth week! Unfortunately Wanted couldn't collect much 'coz of rejection from the urban multiplex audiences but amusingly these same multiplex audiences turned up in hoards to watch Dabangg the very next year.Its official now.58 cr weekend and a 25 cr Sunday! The movie's collecting huge in the Gujarat/Maharashtra belt but has underperformed in other territories,a trend we last saw in the Republic day release of 2012 Agneepath. The next 2 days will decide whether this one will cross 150 or fold up at 130-140! Anyways this one is certainly not a Super Hit and Salman's dream record breaking sequence of 5 blockbusters has certainly come to an end. Time for crossdressing Hakla fans to rejoice and dance to the tunes of "Bole Chudiyan" and "Tujhe Dekha To Ye Jaana" in true Karva Chauth style :POh my god!!!! A pathetic movie in which one of the 1000 jobless cameo actor bring an army tank!!a f#$*@&g; army tank!!!!!!!!!!! in to a public road and You are calling it average@Anuj how can you compare dabangg with ghajni,what i understand the number of screens across india was less of ghajni then dabangg so it should earn bit less than even with extended run.Also the sports film which i thought to be trash and thought no body will see was Chak de(before it released) but i rate it much higher after i saw also what about JO Jeeta.One more thing Jai ho earned approx 8-9 crs on Monday now what you think.I would say 120-125 max.Jai Ho grosses $840506 in the US/Canada  and kicks off at 21st spot in its first weekend.  May end up at < $1.6m  Last year Himmatwala, OUATIMD, & Besharam missed a top 20 spot in the US.Top Hindi Film Stars in the US (distributor preference)  Aamir = Ranbir > Hrithik > Shahrukh = SalmanWhy are fans so passionate about stars who don't even know they exist!  Salman had a good run last 3 years but the end is not too far. Jai ho was the first sign of his downfall if he does not change his choice of movies. As far as acting is concerned, he is limited in that capacity but he still can select scripts which suit his acting.  Arnold Swarzenneger's best role is the Terminator which completely utilized his expressionless acting. Salman still has a huge fanbase buf they can not make a blockbuster by themselves. A movie has to be universally accepted to be a blockbuster like Dhoom 3.  Nobody can deny the fact that Aamir has the best sense of script selection jn the business.  Passionatd fans like Anuj can only take a movie to a safe zone and sometimes not even that.  This movie was earlier titled Mental which was a more approprite title for this movie!!Oh,now my doubts have indeed been confirmed about this Ehinome guy being an absolute jack. The US market forms under 1% of the worldwide bollywood audience (with 98% of it residing in India itself) and he wants to be hellbent on giving out those figures! And even by US standards,Ranbir>HR>Srk???? Rofl!! which world are u living in kid? Its a known fact that Srk has penetrated the Nri audience long before the other Khans' and Roshan did and is b-town's biggest superstar overseas (within that 2-3% audience). And kindly refrain from even mentioning that unproven performer and practical clown called Ranbir Kapoor among the Khans' & Roshan! Its like naming Rohit Sharma between Sachin,Sourav,Rahul and VVS!@Adam : "Salman still has a huge fanbase buf they can not make a blockbuster by themselves."!nope you're wrong...Salman's fanbase is massive enough to make a movie a top grossing Super Hit in itself as we saw in the cases of Bodyguard and Dabangg-2 which were outrightly rejected by non Salman fans. The problem with Jai Ho is its uninspiring trailers,lousy soundtrack and an expressionless actress which has turned away even die hard Salman fans! And yes even I would like to see him come up with either a Tere Naam/HDDCS or a Partner at this juncture.Just for a bit of change!Unfortunately, the next movie of Salman is once again a remake of a south indian movie called Kick.  It will also be directed by a new director Sajid Khan. I have not seen Kick but there is an audience fatigue with the South indian movie remakes. I can bet that Jai Ho would have been a blockbuster if it came out in 2011 and 2012 (maybe 2013 too) But not anymore.  Every actor worth his salt has tried this formula beaten to death like Akshay, Ajay Devgn, Saif and even Shahid!! SRK is a smart actor who did not go the south remake route but did try his hand in the south genre and maintained his famous Rahul character in the movie.  This was an amazing and brilliant move by either SRK or Rohit Shetty to bring his Rahul character into a south movie environment. The end result was a highly entertaining movie which did not feel repetitive at all.  To be honest, SRK and more so Aamir try different genres and take a risk to bring different kind of movies to the audience (SRK changes up between his repetitive ones - Chak De, Don, My name is Khan, Ra One, CE.  Repetitive - KKKG, KANK, VZ, JTHJ) Salman needs to step back and rethink his next strategy. The Suraj Bharjatya movie might bring a change which maybe what is needed...@Adam:Funny that u talk about variety and forget to mention my favourite Hrithik Roshan :P  How about Koi Mil Gaya,Lakshya,Krrish,Dhoom-2,Jodhaa Akbar,Guzaarish,ZNMD & Agneepath for variety? And if u say Srk changes up between repetitive one's then so does Salman. Ready was an outright comedy while EET was a spy thriller/romance. The difference though is that Aamir's & HR's changes do work wonders among the audience (RDB,TZP,3I,KMG,Jodhaa Akbar,ZNMD for instance) while Srk's changes usually fall flat (Dil Se,Asoka,DOn,Ra.1...all barring Chak De India). All his worthless fans wanna see of him is spreading his arms out film after film and stammering his way through romantic mushy dialogues which makes his female fanbase mainly consisting of dumb college teens and middle aged aunties go weak on their knees :PUnfortunately, the next movie of Salman is once again a remake of a south indian movie called Kick.  It will also be directed by a new director Sajid Khan. I have not seen Kick but there is an audience fatigue with the South indian movie remakes. I can bet that Jai Ho would have been a blockbuster if it came out in 2011 and 2012 (maybe 2013 too) But not anymore.

Repetitive - KKKG, KANK, VZ, JTHJ) Salman needs to step back and rethink his next strategy. The Suraj Bharjatya movie might bring a change which maybe what is needed...Its true that Hritik is too an actor trying different genres along with Aamir,,,,and srk too is trying a litl bit with his genre,,,,Chak de Don 1  and My Name is khan were have been liked by the audience,,,,and about CE all of us knows,,how much it have been liked by indian audience,,,,But when we come to salmaan prblm is that he tries his movies withing the usual genres of movies and doesn't picks the unusual genres which are shown less in bollywood,,,,and the 2nd and the most important prblm is that his characterisation in all of his movies are moreover same,,,,its hard to make difference between his characters,,,he always acts as salmaan khan and not as the character given to him.....@Anup:I think his performance in Tere Naam is one of the best seen on celluloid by a commercial lead in the last decade! For all that "king of romance" talk,i'm yet to witness Srk play a lover with as much intensity as that (Devdas was a ham imo)."he always acts as salmaan khan and not as the character given to him."~really? Chulbul Pandey is one of the most iconic characters in bollywood history and so is the Prem of Hahk/MPK! I guess u might wanna reframe that statement!@Anuj - Salmaan have done great chracters in the past,,,,,as i mentioned earlier His Prem of HSSH was my fav charater but m not talking about those years m talking about last 3-4 years,,,,see salmaan has so repeatetive in his movie genres and characters that these are the movies (from Wanted to Jai ho) which represent Salmaan now,,,,only big fans like remember his old good works,,,,for all others Salmaan is just a hero who give same type of movies half yearly......This is the thing salmaan have to change,,,,to make people remember what he had donr in the past and what are his character.....Yes , chulbul pandey is an exception,,,,Salmaan has done it brilliently,,,,specially the Shudh Hindi words he uses ,, i have enjoyed it alot......But if i pick ETT and leave the first chasing scene ,, not for a single minute salmaan looks or acts like a spy,,,,i dont know whether its director’s fault or Salmaan’s but that really raises questions on capability of salmaan to act as a versatile actor.....Even Saif’s Charactor in agent vinod was alot better then Salmaan in ETT ... M not comparing the movies But yes Saif really acted like a real spy in Agent Vinod......Salmaan have proved alot that he is the biggest star of bollywood,,,,but there are alot of things he have to prove to the persons like me who are not die hard fan of him.....@ANUJ - the thing said by u about salmaan playing Prem is an iconic character,,,,that same can said by Srk fan for all the RAHUL he played ........And u say u have yet to see srk as king of romance with such intensity,,,,because it cant be denied that RAHUL - of srk is iconic too....So its a fight between salmaan and srk fan,,,,,,m out of it,,,,lolzzzz...."i dont know whether its director’s fault or Salmaan’s but that really raises questions on capability of salmaan to act as a versatile actor"~if a guy's been acting for 25 years and has given hits in almost every possible genre and yet being made to look like a moron,its obviously the fault of the film-makers,right from the script writers to the screenplay writers to the director,isn't it? As for SRK and Salman,SRK's Rahul and Salman's Prem might be iconic characters in themselves (i'm not too fond of any of these characters since romance is a genre i'm not fond of),but i'm yet to witness Srk give a popular hit in an outright comical genre! Aamir's got AAA and 3Idiots,Salman's got countless number of comical hits but all Srk's got in the name of comedy are Baadshah and Duplicate! Same goes for my favourite actor Hrithik Roshan too (although he's excelled in everything he's played barring comedy). Perfect comic timing is an extremely tough art to master which Salman has done quite well imo! And along with performances like Tere Naam is one of the major reasons why i rate him quite highly as an actor irrespective of what the media and the hypocrites say!@Anuj and @Anup i am enjoying the conversation between both of you.I dont know about yours ages not because age is any factor over here about knowledge but because i have seen those times watching films in single screens.In mid 90's till mid 2000 SRK was a huge star and nobody was near him.Only person near him was Sunny Deol.Amir was way behind and Salmaan was a star i dont deny that but you can see Jeet or Saajan and even HAHK or Sanam Bewafa he always played second fiddle.Amir after lagaan has always tried to do some thing different and hence became a bigger star.SRK was Amitabh and Salman is and would always be Dharmendra.So how much we fight on this issue it would make no difference to any of there fan base.It only makes difference to persons like us who enjoy every actor and a entertainment and are unbiased.@Shiddhart - m also a kind of person who like to watch every actor and wants to give each and every movie a chance to be seen and then decide how the movie is,,,,denying the fact that whether the actor or actress in the movie is my fav or not,,,,because if some actor is performing well then definatly he would be one of my fav in future......But there are persons who are baised to there fav actors,,,,and always do fights with each other in different blogs and websites,,,,thats actually not right,,,,any ways,,,,its not in my hand....Though its my pleasure that u enjoy our conversation,,,,its really good to discuss movies with some knowlegable persons like Anuj and Meetu....@Anuj - there is a small request,,,,,can u provide me the lifetime collection of dedh ishqiya,,,,with its budget , total grossing (including overseas) and its ROI.....I would be thank full.....@Siddharth : Srk's popularity between 1995-2004 was heavily over-rated by the media! He's nowhere close to Amitabh/Dharmendra/Salman when it comes to popularity among the interiors and B/C center audiences (which even today constitute at least 70% of the total audience in sheer numbers). His popularity was,is and will always be based within the urban sector and Nri audiences. Even the biggest of SRK hits like DDLJ,KKHH,K3G were mainly 'coz of their stupendous performances in cities like Bombay,Delhi,Kolkata,Bangalore,Ahemadabad etc! Salman on the other hand has had monster hits like MPK,HAHK,Dabangg which have penetrated the interiors and have scored huge among that 70% of the masses (of course they've scored reasonably among urban audiences too but no at par with Srk hits). Aamir on the other hand is a guy whose done a bit of both. He's had monster hits among B/C centers like Dil,Raja Hindustani,he's had cult hits among multiplex audiences like RDB,TZP and he's also had universal blockbusters like Ghajini,3Idiots and Dhoom-3! Hrithik too has done something similar via films like KNPH,Krrish,Agneepath among the masses and Jodha-Akbar/ZNMD among urban audiences (but not at par with Aamir's level of hits). Its like in the urban sector(including overseas) its SRK>Aamir>Hrithik>Salman and among the masses its Salman>Aamir>Hrithik>Srk! And I definitely do not agree with u when u say Salman played second fiddle in HAHK. HAHK was an outright solo hero film with a monster heronie in the lead but that does not take credit away from Salman! Salman playing second fiddle in HAHK is equivalent to saying Srk played second fiddle to Kajol in DDLJ,doesn't make sense!@Anup : Dedh Ishqiya,investment around INR 35 cr,all India nett collection will be around the 28 cr mark with the share of around 14-15 cr. Overseas share will be around the 4-5 cr mark and revenue from non theatrical avenues has not yet been disclosed since most satellite channels have backed out from telecasting the film after the film's below par theatrical run. Even if they do manage to negotiate through various bargains (u know what i mean) it will only be a coverage film for the producers and a lossmaker for the distributors/exhibitors. Hence it falls in the Below Average/Flop category although it has been able to avert a "disaster" tag courtesy its decent week 2 performance!@Anuj dont compare Kajol with Madhuri.Madhuri during the time in 1994 she was already a set star while Kajol in DDLJ was quite new may be 3-4 films old which i could recall.There were films of Salmaan in  that era which were hit only because of Salmaan power and they were Bandhan,Judwa.Infact SRK too was not that a bigger star in 1994-1995 though he did had Baazigar,Darr etc.I specially mentioned HAHK because it was more Madhuri then Salmaan.I dont know which centers are B&C; but in my town and where i had traveled during my studies basically UP and MP and then Delhi it was always SRK then Salmaan and Amir was way beyond though he did some good films in that era.Infact we were more to Sunny,Anil and Sanjay in early 90's and offcourse Govinda and Amitabh@Anuj one more thing  Dedh Ishqiya budget which is shown in wiki is 15 then how come it is 35 crs,is that they wasted 20 crs on Promotion?@Siddharth:Its not that Srk's not popular in small towns! But Salman's way ahead of him in these places if u compare their 25 year filmography...Maine Pyaar Kiya was the biggest hit of the 80's while HAHK was the biggest hit of the 90's. And between Dabangg to Dabangg2 he's redefined the word stardom and taken his popularity to a different level altogether! No actor in bollywwod history has gievn 5 back to back blockbusters in a row not even Amitabh or Dilip Kumar! And when i say B/C centers i'm referring to circuits dominated by single screen theaters like Central India,CP Berar,Bihar/Odisha,interiors of UP,Rajasthan,MP and interiors of Maharashtra! A centers refers to plex dominated territories like Punjab/Delhi,Bangalore/Mysore,Hyderabad,large parts of Gujarat and the biggest among them viz Mumbai! As for Dedh Ishqiya,as i'v mentioned on a forum before,do not rely on untrustworthy sites like Wiki and a few other for such information. 15-20 is only the basic minimum production cost. Add to the the cost of advertising,promotions,prints,cost of release etc etc and it goes up to 35 cr! At least that's what is the foolproof,transparent bit. No corporate distribution house reveals exact details to the media in such cases!@Siddharth:Refer my blog for further queries and box office details. Although i have dismantled the comments section due to troll elements who started with their usual abusing and foul-mouthing on a few occasions!@Anuj Point taken.I usually check wiki for English films but currently i thought it was giving valid information.I would say sent me the blog url and would also say enable the comment section so that a discussion can be made not at the cost of wogma :-)Also i asked you about Jai ho whats your point now about the earning.@Siddharth,Anup : Sure,comments section has been enabled for the last 3 posts! Send me your queries directly and feel free to comment!http://bollyindiaboxoffice.blogspot.in/I saw it yesterday, its one of the worst movies of Salman Khan.Watched it this morning. An unusual concoction of mass entertainment with a socially relevant theme is what has led to this movie's downfall. This kind of over the top action entertainment looks brilliant in movies like Wanted and Dabangg whose only purpose is to entertain and nothing more. But not in a movie where the makers' are trying to send out a social message. I guess the makers of Jai Ho should have taken a cue out of Lage Raho Munnabhai and gone the comical/satirical way than the mass action entertainment way with such content at their disposal. 2.5/5@Meetu one suggestion for you.i would say watch these types of movies in low end multiplex or a decent single screen,may be you would enjoy more than usual because usually watching these types of movies in high end multiplex where audience do not relate or get attach with these types of movies.@Siddharth oh no, don't worry about that. The multiplex I watch it has a lot of college students for the first day first show. The theater is a riot! In Dabangg there were girls dancing in the theater when Salman's shirt tore off. :D@Meetu that was gud one girls dancing.I have witnessed this in single screen once i was watching Darr where whenever sunny was beating SRK the girls where saying dheere maar lagti hogi usko."I have witnessed this in single screen once i was watching Darr where whenever sunny was beating SRK the girls where saying dheere maar lagti hogi usko"~a perfect and apt definition of the sensibility and iq of Srk fangirls and why am i not surprised! :D@Anuj I agree that's pretty dumb but how do you explain men whistling at the sight of a topless 48yr old man@Anuj the comment was meant for some light humor dont take it too far.Fans are Fans they support the person unselfishly.So whether some one likes somebody it is all his\her personal choice.I cant delete the comment but if somebody does not like it I am sorry for that.@Gokul:Notice carefully mate...the whistles for the 48 year old topless man come from women of all quarters of the society,housewives,aunties,senior citizens,college girls,young mothers',teenagers etc be it urban or rural India. The whistles from the men come at the time of an extraordinary superstar making a heroic entry smashing window panes and wooden doors and single handedly butchering 30 goons all by himself! Much more whistle worthy than repeated Bole Chidiyan's and Mahi Ve's for over 15 years :P@Anuj Well Salman has been repeating his schmuck for the last 5-6 yrs too and as for the entry,Ithink its more idiotic than heroic3.5 years to be precise. Dabangg released in Sept.2010! As for what you and I think,your opinion's your's,mine's mine! His one liners' coupled with massy action sequences is the stuff blockbuster bollywood mass entertainment is made of! He does need to mix and match a little though!@Anuj: "an extraordinary superstar making a heroic entry smashing window panes and wooden doors and single handedly butchering 30 goons all by himself!" How can this be whistle worthy?? People flying in the air after doing 10 flips in mid air!! It looks good in a Matrix setting but Matrix released 15 years ago!! Get over it and make more D-Day style action. Most of the sensible people would like a Hero such as Ethan Hunt from "Mission Impossible" who still performs unbelievable stunts but at least makes it look real and fun. "single handedly butchering 30 goons all by himself!" How can anyone sensible in our times even begin to like this kind of action??"How can anyone sensible in our times even begin to like this kind of action??"~well actually a lot of people do,especially among the masses. No wonder we got Super Hits like Ghajini,Dabangg,Singham,Bodyguard,Rowdy Rathore and Dabangg-2! Personally,i have mentioned on another post too that I'd prefer watching action sequences like the one's in films like Sarfarosh,Khakee,Lakshya and Shootout At Lokhandwala. The Ethan Hunt equivalent in bollywood translates to films like Don/Race/Dhoom which does not work for me in a Indian scenario where "crude" makes a lot more sense than "slick".Direction: 2    Story: 2    Lead Actors: 2.5    Character Artists: 2    Dialogues: 1.5    Screenplay: 2    Music Director: 1    Lyrics: 1Dear Sir,  We are a distinguished ad agency  based out of Delhi/NCR, India.

Sure to finish at < $1.35m .Jai Ho topped Hindi film box office with 84.46cr in its first week, made 12.8cr in 2nd weekend, a lifetime of <116cr is expected.   Verdict  -   ?JAI HO Final Verdict : AVERAGE,Super-Hit for producers,Semi-Hit theatrical performance,Average for global distributors Eros Intl.,Flop for regional territorial distributors!@Anuj shouldnt it be a Flop or even below average because it was sold to Eros for about 80crs itself and has just about to manage 110crs atmost.@Siddharth : It is no doubt a Flop for its distributors but verdicts are not given based on distributor profit and loss alone! Theatrical performance is another criteria (which is reasonable in case of Jai Ho despite its huge underperformance) and the producers of the film have made the highest table profit in Bollywood history by pre selling the film at huge prices and making a profit of around 100 crs. All these factors taken together have contributed to it being an Average performer (similar to Ra.1 which too made losses for its distributors yet was an Above Average affair).http://bollyindiaboxoffice.blogspot.in/2014/01/jai-ho-reviews.htmlPS : This is my opinion and my methodology. Different sources have different methods of giving verdicts. According to boxofficeindia's theatrical verdict methodology,Jai Ho will be a Semi-Hit/Above Average while by Nahta's distributor ROI methodology it will be a Flop. I give verdicts based on theatrical performance coupled with ROI! For more refer to my blog.Excellent Movie, Great work done by Salman and team.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
