A romantic rumination trying to be sold as a thriller it is not. Interesting but not enough. Lots of philosophy but towards no tangible direction.Finally we have a trailer that creates just the right amount of intrigue. It's slick and crisp. It seems like it has a solid story that will hold and keep your attention. If you asked me to tell me what the film could possibly about by just looking at the trailer, I wouldn't be able to put it in non-vague words. At the same time I know it is a thriller of sorts and has a complicated romantic angle to it. So, it is very easy to slip into mundane and regular very quickly. But, in some sense reminded me of Lootera.The cast is interesting too. I admit, Jacqueline Fernandez looks like she is playing the run of the mill prop lead lady. But, the men create enough mystery around them. Music Reviews:

  “A story tells you a lot about the writer.” is a running thought through Roy. Almost forcing you to think that a film tells you a lot about the director. You can tell director, Vikramjit Singh is struggling to tell his story, just like his character Kabir Grewal (Arjun Rampal), a director is struggling with his film's narrative. Roy is not a thriller. It is a romantic film. In fact, it is two romantic love stories that try hard to intertwine and mingle. Unfortunately, this connect doesn't work at all. I can imagine it having worked at the hands of a better narrator but, here you can barely see the parallels even when you are trying hard.The mystique around the two stories as is created in the trailer, is demystified very early on in the film. Only that it is not intentional. In fact, the big reveal feels neither big nor that much of a reveal when it comes about. The film lingers. Not in a good way though. It could be to accentuate the characters. All four lead characters are brooders, the male more so than the female ones. Interestingly enough, the film feels very verbose. Despite the long silences, when the characters speak, there is a good chance it is an attempt at something deep and philosophical. This is great, especially because there are very few films that can say they have non-inane dialogue. But sadness is, the lines meant to be meaningful and introspective turns out inconsequential. I have always complained that Hindi films don't have enough conversations, it has only dialogue. It is refreshing to see characters actually converse in Roy. Individually, the conversations are interesting, but they don't add up to making the film engaging. The lines are not boring but the film stretches on to “nothing happening”. Again not in a good way.It doesn't help that the writing of the “romance” parts is weak. You have no clue what Aisha is on about. You know that Kabir and his character Roy are going through an internal struggle that is a source of their forlorn attitude. But, neither you nor the writers get quite a grapple over why the inner voice is  so troubled.What does keep you going despite disappointment at not being able to fathom what is happening and why are the performances. Arjun Rampal finally comes out of the wooden mould and lets his eyes speak and they speak volumes. A lot of the internal conflict you can sense is through his expression and body language rather than the character's thoughts that come out as dialogue. Jacqueline Fernandez too is less of a doll and has a little more to do with her character. It would've been great if her role was a little more detailed. The most intriguing of the lot, you could call Ranbir Kapoor's performance as holding just one expression. But there is this one scene where the hopelessness of his life turns into hope and you can see the light in his eye change without a movement of a facial muscle. But none of it good enough to make you endure 2.5 hours of “so much talk” leading to pretty much nothing. It is almost as if the filmmakers had a sense of this too. What else can explain the fillers in the form of songs and the fight sequence that seems to have been made just to be able to promote the film as a thriller.Even if you give the film a point or two extra for attempting something different, you can't escape the fact that it is on the borderline of making very little sense. Different ain't good enough.

        ...Vikramjit Singh is clearly not a votary of melodrama and prefers to dabble on the undercurrents that play out between the layers of a story. The characters in Roy remain by and large muted. It’s a strange, slow, somnolent film that will be liked by only a few with an acquired taste. ...

Ranbir Kapoor is a little too sober and low-key to be able to keep his fan-base contended while Arjun Ramphal, looking soulful and intense, seems a bit lost in this entirely puerile exercise. Above all, there is nothing much to the script other than parallel plotlines tentatively feeding off each other through random musings and bizarre wordplay – and that’s not a pretty sight mind you! ...

: I avoided watching at Theater Bcoz of Jaquline, but feel sorry for trying it Online too..!!
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.After a long wait of 2hr and 27min at last when the movie ended a person behind me screamed that after watching ROY he will definitely start respecting even SAJID KHAN.. And actually i totally agree with him. Even in Humshakal by count i laughed 3times that means i liked 3 scenes from Humshakal but by count i didn't like any of the scene from the whole movie ROY. Its  such a bad movie that its too hard to describe. I dont even remember when was the last time i was so bored watching a movie in theater.This movie doesn't have anything to show , should not have been made on the first place as per me. And i actually dont know what the hell was Ranbir Kapoor doing in the movie.The transition befween two love story was so bad that the audience get confused  which story they were watching . [comment partially deleted for giving part of movie away] When it comes to acting Arjun rampal was below average , looks sleepy all the time.Jacqline was bad too as she cant even act differently for two different characters .And for Ranbir i will repeat again I DONT KNOW AT ALL WHAT THE HELL WAS HE DOING IN THIS FILM.Only reason which can be given after too much scratching your head that  you can watch this movie for some gorgeous locations of Malaysia. Then again there are other sources for that...Dont waste your Valentines Week with this SHITThis is the worst movie of Ranbir Kapoor's carrier.@Anup a pretty strong worded negative review.  Read such a strong negative opinion after a long time.  Roy seems to have annoyed you to a great extent. I am gonna take your advice and stay away from tgis.ps: waiting to read Anuj's victory shout :-)@Anup a pretty strong worded negative review.  Read such a strong negative opinion after a long time.

I am gonna take your advice and stay away from tgis.ps: waiting to read Anuj's victory shout :-)@Fan- Some of my comments have been deleted as i have been written something which could have given away the plot,,but thats only because i dont want anybody to watch the movie.It has got biggest opening of this year and atleast gonna be a semi Hit as per its rate of grossing of two days..Which makes me angry but couldnt do anything as the songs where hit and the presence of Ranbir only(who actually doesn't do anything in the film inspite of roaming here and there. didn't even get enough dialogues to say )  makes audience to watch it .Anyways great decision by you. Dont go anywhere close to this film.I dont know why meetu havnt given SWITCH CHANNEL.The movie currently holdes 2.9/10 on imdb , and its gonna go much more downwards. The only other three big Bollywood movies with such low ratings on IMDB are RGV'S AAG , HIMMATWALA & HUMSHAKAL. I have personally given it 2/10.I dont know why meetu havnt given SWITCH CHANNEL.The movie currently holdes 2.9/10 on imdb , and its gonna go much more downwards.

U can guess from that how bad the movie is.Feel sorry for Ranbir Kapoor fans , after a long wait of 16 months since disastrous BESHARAM they got a movie from ranbir i.e., ROY in front of which even Besharam seems like a genuine Film.Oh my god!!!!!!!!!!Don't know why but I went to watch this expecting a great thriller only to get a half baked boring love story.It was the feeling of Ek Villain all over again.Bollywwod why you do this???????Even Watching Online is a waste of Time and Data charges..!!!@Anup I think a writer's character having a life that runs parallel to his own is a concept worth exploring. :)@Gokul : I don't think Ek Villain was as bad as what you describe it. I quite liked Ritesh's attempt in that movie. It was an Above Average film imo and a decent mass entertainer. As for ROY, the trailers itself were so bland and boring, there was absolutely nothing that would make me watch this! At the box office, Roy is a huge FLOP as even its target audience ie the urban multiplexes would give it a big thumbs down.@Anup: yes I had seen the spoilers in your "unmodified" post.  Even though I was not planning to watch the film, I immediately stopped reading the post when I realised that spoilers are coming upfront.Might be a good idea (to avoid parts of posts getting deleted) to explicitly put a SPOILERS AHEAD ALERT.  Otherwise I can understand that wogma admins don't like them as wogma stands for Without Giving the Movie Away.Ek Villain was nothing great.  Since I watched it in theatre on big screen, it did seem palatable.  I am sure that if I had watched it directly on TV then I would not have enjoyed it, barring RD's performance. Sometimes you really wonder why do producers make such films?  But then on paper every film looks a blockbuster - its the execution that fails them.HI Meetu,Can you please review "Rahasya". I hv heard some good reviews about it. But it did nto release here in US.@Soham As far as I can tell, it didn't release in Pune either.@Anuj I have to agree Ek Villain is far better than Roy.I just said that because like Villain,this one too was promoted as a thriller only to be a love story.Performance since last November :Shaukeens : FlopKill Dil : FlopHappy Ending : DisasterUngli : DisasterAction Jackson : FlopPK : All Time HitTevar : FlopAlone : DisasterBaby : AverageShamitabh : DisasterRoy : DisasterSomeone please make some better content :/Roy was such a slow movie, and not much romance or clear cut suspense story. The best part about Roy was the music. Chittiyaan Kalaiyaan is the best song from Roy, very energetic girly song. Tu Hai Ki Nahi and Sooraj Dooba Hai are also alright songs. The movie would be better if it was shorter also.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
