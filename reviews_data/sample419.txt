Why does the heart often want to do things that aren't "right"?~ You wonder philosophically while watching Shudh Desi Romance. Unfortunately, not entirely because of the film.I look forward to films written by Jaideep Sahni. How many writers can we really say that about? He takes the ups and downs of a story in such perfect rhythm, that even though it is as predictable as it gets, you are hooked. If not the plot, the situations, if not that the smart dialogue, if none of those work, you at least have wonderfully smooth lyrics, sample this.To top it off, you have great performers in Sushant Singh and Parineeti Chopra. These days, just Rishi Kapoor makes the film worth watching. I hope he has a sizable role. The trailer is absolutely engaging as a light romcom.However, there is one downer. The title song which looks like pure promotional material is rather lame. I hope it stays out of the film. Music Reviews:
Bollyspice - "4/5" 
glamsham - "3.5/5" 
Milliblog - A 300-worder no less, that ends with "Sachin-Jigar have set their own bar really high now!" 
Music Aloud - "8.5/10"

  Is marriage dying? No, not yours or a marriage around you. Marriage - as a concept, is it dying? That's the question Shudh Desi Romance is trying to get a hold of. You'd think it is as interesting as the trailers and songs of the film promised. Alas, that doesn't work out. 15-20 minutes into the film and you know the plot is falling flat. I've warmed up to the idea of confused / listless / loser lead characters since I started seeing poetry in their tragedy. So, I try to find that in Raghuram Sitaram (Sushant Singh Rajput). That made me want to love him. Also, Rajput plays the youngster with earnestness. His confusion though boyish, comes across as a very "man"-like thing to do. Yes, yes, stereotyping and all. But, I can imagine many women going "these men!" if they look at him from the "he can't express himself" angle. He does have his charm, yet it is very difficult to see why these vibrant, confidently aggressive women - two not one - have fallen for him. What's that they say about love, again? Let's say blind, it is. So, two blind women and a loser. Even if I were told that before watching the film, so strong is my faith in Jaideep Sahni that I'd still look forward to it. And he doesn't disappoint - well, at least not in the dialogue. The lines are earthy, snappy, and delivered well. In fact, they are the only things that keep the film going. And Rishi Kapoor, of course - thank goodness for him! After all, there's only so much that can keep you interested if events get repetitive. And that is where I had a hard time accepting that it is Jaideep Sahni's work. True, there is a pattern to every person's behavior, especially when it comes to their love life. But, the repetition here isn't interesting enough to sail you through 2+ hours. It's almost as if the makers realised it was getting boring when they have the characters break the fourth wall to explain their motives to us. For one, their characters weren't that deeply sketched for us to have too many questions about their motivation. And then, there are some things that are better left unsaid. Also, with the realistic treatment that the film gets from its art director, it is a rude intrusion. Not that B-town neighbours accepting a young couple in a live-in relationship is very real. But, then that you accept as a realism that the makers wish for or even foresee. It helps that Parineeti Chopra and Vaani Kapoor make Gayatri and Tara seem very comfortable with who they are. Except when it comes to being intimate with the guy they are in love with. I must admit here, that the awkard first kiss is charming in its own way. But, it is difficult to believe that the couple who is so comfortable when they sing are so out of sorts when they aren't singing about their love life. After comments on varying topics from US' involvement in wars world-wide to safety of women in India, all it boils down to is the lyrics of one of the songs - 'chanchal mann, ati random...' (Flitting mind/heart, very random) - Shudh Desi Romance - with all its zeal to be pertinent, comes across as rather random.

blahssome:
          And if by chance Shuddh Desi Romance fails commercially the makers will simply say "it was too bold for India" which is a load of shit.

          Shuddh Desi Romance- 
In terms of pointless posturing, this one ranks even lower than Yash Raj's Neal 'N' Nikki.

: Such a rubbish movie.The guy and girl stay as bro-sis when they are in live in relationship.
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.The title of the film is grossly misleading.  And for a film of such unIndian culture, such a misleading name could put several family audiences through a massively cringing fest during 2+ hours.Shame on YRF for misleading people on such a matter.As usual, a garbage product from the top production house.  Not at all for families.  And not at all for youngsters neither.Shuddh desi Bhartiya:Moral Police LOL... :PPS: I havn't seen it yet and not really fond of YRF but lets not stereotype Indian culture into something asexual and boring... please, kids are much smarter than you think...Whoa, @Shdduh desi Bhartiya! That's a whole lot of hostility for a first comment - and as a Western fan of Indian entertainment movies, I kind of enjoy Yash Raj's commitment to light romantic comedies and adventures....@Ramen - it's what happens with every culture, it seems. Often the movies that are considered the "junkiest" domestically are the ones that most often are successful overseas, because they "travel well".... YRF's films travel very well, usually, because they're light romantic comedy/adventures with big musical numbers.All that said, @Meetu - I get the feeling this isn't a film we're going to be watching in my piece of the USofA.... :/YRF is just in the business of making fast buck, no matter how low they have to stoop.This is not a question of moral policing.YRFs constant stereotyping of modern Indian women just increases the misconception that modern Indian girls are of low morals, readily available, are sexually active towards anybody, etc.  Modern Indian women can do lots of good things other than kissing and making out with any Tom Dick Harry.The film tries too hard to be realistic, depending extensively upon smart one liners and dialouges. It does intrigues the audience but i felt the story could ave been more poignant , had the swashbuckling characters of the two leads been quite seriously portrayed. One time watch and this isn't a desi romance.@Shudh Desi Bhartiya Well, it is not all cringe-worthy, but yes, I agree my parents would not like it at all :DI don't think the women here were making out with any random person. They made some bad choices and they were open about it. As they were open about their sexuality. Not to mention, these are two out of many women. No one is saying all women are this open about their love life.On the other hand, I agree with @Ramen. The next generation is much more out there than we think. @TimELiebe Well, Shudh Desi Romance is not 'that' kind of a YRF film. And yes, a lot of what can be enjoyed in the film is in the dialogue and I really doubt it can be translated that well. Sometimes it is about the way the words are used.@guddu Don't you think the definition of 'desi' is changing, slowly?So-So movie. We all live in a Society where nobody can tolerate this kind of relationship at all. Just imagine the situation that Girls are getting pregnant & being aborted in bulk after indulging into this kind of relationship. Does the Director of this movie wants to give the  culture of Filthy & Dirty USA where these things are quite common & prevelant everywhere where there is infact no value of husband-wife, mother-father-brother-sister's relationship, they give a dame care about it? Infact I was expecting a happy marriage end of this movie where they do understand & could have learn from their mistakes. But unfortunately it was not like that.  So I would say songs r good, some scenes too but not ending with a good social message.1So-Sobout to watch shud i guys?Such a rubbish movie.The guy and girl stay as bro-sis when they are in live in relationship.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
