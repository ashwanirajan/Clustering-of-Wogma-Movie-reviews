Better than some RGV products. Yes, that isn't saying much in favor of the film.It suffers from the usual trappings of a RGV film – loud background music, weird camera angles of props that make them look unnecessarily spooky, lots of slow-mo, awful performances. On the other hand though, we get regular breaks from each of the above. Ok, except for the awful performances. I would've added that the silver lining is that it has an intriguing story but you are never allowed to connect with the characters and the narration is not gripping enough to engage you otherwise. For one, whenever you could be a part of the plot, you are distanced. Discussions between characters are muted under loud music. You are left looking at characters animatedly moving their lips at each other with over-enthusiastic expressions. This doesn't happen just once or twice, but is a regular feature. Beyond that then, it is plotting and failings from both sides that make both Veerappan and the police officer look sinister. In fact, at times the police officer comes across as gruesome and manipulative. While this could be viewed as an attempt at striking a balance, the police officers are justified a little too often. Also, you never get too close to the details anyway.The funniest bit is I found myself giving Veerappan, the film a few marks because it wasn't as much of a disasterous two hours as I expected it to be. That unfortunately, isn't really speaking for the film now, is it?

        ...In certain aspects of storytelling then, this is a film that cannot be ignored. It is however hard to get past the poor acting by Joshi and Ray and that overly loud background score. I kept imagining this film in my head with the same director, but with music at a lower volume, starring Adil Hussain or Kay Kay Menon and Tabu in the roles played by Joshi and Ray. What excellent co-stars they could have made to the very talented Sandeep Bharadwaj. Too late for that of course.

If it was not for the lifeless performances from most of the cast and the silly BG score, this would have been a better film.

Once the illusion withers away, there's really nothing to hold on to.
