Aarakshan is, what I call, a bell-curve film. Starts shabbily, reaches a peak around mid-way and ends more shabbily than it started. And yes, the issue is not "quote system", we are talking about our hollow education system here. Only that, that too gets a superfluous treatment.I heard of Aarakshan very recently. It's very difficult not to get me excited about a political drama. And with a title like Aarakshan, a topic so close to home, I instantly began looking forward to the film. 
The next thing I found out was the interesting mix in the cast I imagined a strong and determined 
Amitabh Bachchan and Saif Ali Khan fighting it out against a nasty Manoj Pajpai with a  Deepika Padukone thrown in to normalize the gender equation. But the trailer is a pleasant surprise - 

On a topic like 'reservations' in the education system, you have  Saif Ali Khan playing on a side against  Amtiabh Bachchan. Or at least that's what it looks like. The  Deepika Padukone angle of course, is a little too Mohabbatein-esque with  Amitabh Bachchan playing her dad and the principal of the school/college in which her love interest, Saif Ali Khan is creating trouble. I sure hope she has a meatier character that'll have something more to do than being sandwiched between the men of her life.
In the past few years, we have had a range of films that are trying to point out the common man's frustration with the education system. "Reservations based on caste" is easily the topic that has caused most grief - on both sides. Imagine the frustration of the person who has worked so hard to get that 93% find himself beside a person who has scored 39%. And this in a world where the limited seats are further reduced because of the 39%. I'd imagine the other side of the argument is that it is now time to correct all the injustice that the reserved castes have suffered for centuries. A debate that Aarakshan seems to be trying to do justice to. 
What about illegally obtained "caste certificates" then? The topic would be reduced to mere babble if this issue is not addressed, which makes the topic even more difficult to handle within the confines of a 2.5-to-3-hour film. And yet Prakash Jha has tried. And it looks like he has tried to make a balanced argument. 
He has an awesome cast to support him. They are stars but not treated as such. Look at Amitabh Bachcan's character being yelled at by all and sundry, not to mention he is called a "zero"!
Yes, it is obvious that I'm waiting for August 12th when Aarakshan will present both sides of a debate in which I know what side I'm on. Hope it doesn't get too filmy on me. I don't think a movie like this warrants songs, but here they are, composed by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy-

  The "huh!?" expression I've carried ever since the film ended is now expanded into a full question - If just the title of a film can cause an outrage big enough for the film to be banned in some areas of the country, what will happen if the film actually ends up being about the issue it is named after? We'll have to wait for another film to find out.

Unless, of course, half of Aarakshan was reshot to make it "not" about reservations. After a half-an-hour full of songs, the characters are introduced and the base story is established. And then you hear the perfectly logical and valid sides of the quota-system debate amongst students and teachers, between authorities in education and media, husband and wife, father and daughter. And you are completely sucked into the drama. Only to be let loose very soon, to make sense of a confusion that the writer/director seem to have gone through - confusion about which story to tell. 
Aarakshan (with a different name) could have been a touching tale of a principled crusader, Dr. Prabhakar Anand (Amitabh Bachchan) who just refuses to be put down. His fight is not as much against the government's policy about reservation but against the businessmen who have made education a profitable transaction. And that concept alone has enough weight to make a movie by itself. I mean, I could have very easily let go of the title and readjusted my frame of mind to accept the story of the lovable, ideal teacher, Prabhakar. But, Aarakshan is too black and white to convince me. 
Sure, Prabhakar is not all good, and you see that through his daughter's eyes. But his righteousness is too overwhelming to let us see this not-so-white side. The other characters caving in to his goodness doesn't help either. His nemesis, Mithilesh (Manoj Bajpai) is outright black and makes you want to slap him, alright. 
The other characters have their shades of gray but they don't have enough screen time to let us appreciate them. Yep, including Deepak (Saif Ali Khan) and Poorbi (Deepika Padukone). And this is worse considering that the movie is two hours and forty-five minutes long. 
And even though, the performances by Amitabh Bachchan, Saif Ali Khan, and Manoj Bajpai are enough to pull you through the saga, each of them has a caveat. Manoj Bajpai loses control in the climax without any build-up towards his breakdown. Saif Ali Khan has all of two scenes to make his point. And this is something Amitabh Bachchan can do half asleep. And I cannot stop admiring how the man, with his stature in the industry, can still portray the common man with drooped, burdened shoulders. If only, there was one film that would make us feel, "this" is why he does films. 
If only, this film had what it said it had. I was looking forward to a deeper understanding of the issue, I got songs. I was told an amazing cast will put up the two sides of the issue out on the big screen, they just came in and went out (just like the issues) with no flow and justifications. I was promised a film that will shake up the sleeping common man into action, but I got a solution that was no better than what the villains of the film were upto. And all of this was accompanied with loud background music which took away the little that the dialogues were building up to. 
"Quiet Easily Done" the film says repeatedly whenever Math students want to say, "quod erat demonstrandu"referring to the acronym q.e.d. Aarakshan demonstrates how centuries of wrong done to certain castes can be quite easily undone. And maybe they are right. Most complex problems in life do have simple solutions. All we, the gullible audience, need to do is get together as a mass and protest. And yes, make that one call to the highest authority we can reach to solve our problem for us. Simple. Yep, that's the laughable solution Aarakshan gives us. Now, whose number do we dial to ask the politicians to call off the ban publicity stunt that the Aarakshan team just pulled.

I was promised a film that will shake up the sleeping common man into action, but I got a solution that was no better than what the villains of the film were upto. And all of this was accompanied with loud background music which took away the little that the dialogues were building up to. 
"Quiet Easily Done" the film says repeatedly whenever Math students want to say, "quod erat demonstrandu"referring to the acronym q.e.d. Aarakshan demonstrates how centuries of wrong done to certain castes can be quite easily undone. And maybe they are right. Most complex problems in life do have simple solutions. All we, the gullible audience, need to do is get together as a mass and protest. And yes, make that one call to the highest authority we can reach to solve our problem for us. Simple. Yep, that's the laughable solution Aarakshan gives us. Now, whose number do we dial to ask the politicians to call off the ban publicity stunt that the Aarakshan team just pulled.

a_b_h_i_shek:
          "AARAKSHAN" truly an eye opener for all those who believe in   commercialization of education. A must Watch....!
        
ayushjhunwala:
          Aarakshan. .rocks N Amit uncle is awesome as usual. .

ankur228:
          Just watched AARAKSHAN. Awesome muvie !! Whole muvie was shot at my college !!
        
Amritjoardar:
          Watched Aarakshan yesterday, it was a gud film. Saif deepika relation worked in the movie
        
amolramning:
          #ARAKSHAN a nice film for 2days generation.
such facilities should be provided by the government 4 economically backword & tallent students
        
alok038:
          the coaching criteria which grab indian students is a slow poision "paid business without guarantee". AARAKSHAN must watch movie..
        
aishwaryaxx:
          #Aarakshan ♥ To hell with all the drama, I loved the movie. A. MUST. WATCH. :)
        
40ankit:
          Nice film aarakshan..
        
van25789:
          Hmmm aarakshan is avg movie
        
tomato_umlaut:
          Aarakshan is not what the controversy about it assumed. Good performances by Saif and Amitabh compensate for the episodic story. Watchable
        
sunnychl:
          Watched 'Aarakshan'. Not as bad as people say it is. Soha Ali Khan could have done better though. The moustache was unnecessary.
        
soumendusanyal:
          Aarakshan cud hav been beta... If mr.jha cud hav concentrated on 1 topic rader dan havin an multitracks....!!
        
saurabhgurwara:
          Yeah yeah it was inspiring and thought-provoking, but will someone tell me why the hell it was AARAKSHAN?? name not justified...
        
sagarnautiyal:
          #Aarakshan....not that great movie....nothing to do with aarakshan....but One man show by Sir Amitabh Bacchan #killer acting
        
raviwarrier:
          I think @PrakashJha1 forgot what he was making. More a movie on education corruption than reservation/quota system. Aarakshan - 5.5/10
        
pandyasheetal:
          Saw aarakshan.. Craftly made.. But lil slow.. The 1000s close-up of saif n deepika were not needed..
        
paavani:
          Aarakshan is not as bad as i heard. But i didnt get the solution. As a movie you can watch. 2.5* #review
        
nairutee:
          good performances but content strictly OK! #aarakshan
        
M__Alive:
          Movie review Aarakshan-subject was good but the treatment of movie was very dramatic cld have been more realistic so *** stars to the movie.
        
maximumyum:
          The other day the whole greater family had gone to see Aarakshan. The movie was good in the first half and then sort of whittled away
        
KT_3D:
          how much in enough?? Aarakshan the first part is worth 5stars but the second part not so much solid acting, solid dialogues, worth one watch
        
khadijaejaz:
          Aarakshan: more about coaching classes than reservations, too rushed a first act, not enough character development, but worth a watch.
        
J_5hr1k4nth:
          #Aarakshan was an average movie, the emphasis mostly was on the reservation on basis of poverty and not by caste and creed.
        
itsmegodfather:
          Forget the word AArakshan the movie is too good ...
        
imansooor:
          Aarakshan 3/5
        
harshvictor:
          Aarakshan not a bad movie, but less magic thn Raajneeti :राजनीति.
        
ErraticTravesty:
          Aarakshan lacked the essence of its title. The movie showed many things except the reservation issues. Mediocre!
        
drkarmarkar:
          Saw Aarakshan yestd....if at all it is Pro-aarakshan. Worth a watch. An average depiction of d current Educatn Scenario.
        
atyanand:
          Aarakshan is definitely a movie of two halves. First beautifully presents the reality of reservation. Second is about a personal vendetta.
        
AkkuB:
          Had to keep my ears double open during Aarakshan. Super high fandu hindi. Hv seen prakash jha do better.
        
WorstHandle:
          BTW watched Arakshan today. The film pussied out of focusing on the issue, changed the course of the story in the second part.
        
willgetback:
          AARAKSHAN misses the point completely. To build a future, even in today's India, grades are the least important thing.
        
vikrant85rocks:
          watched arakshan was not brilliant .
        
vikramlalvani:
          watched aarakshan this weekend .it was like 2 different films in 1. 1st half on reservation and 2nd half on private tutions- missed the plot
        
VidhiChadha:
          saw arakshan today. horrible movie. the concept was good except the direction sucked! it was way dramatic and over the top.
        
varungupta984:
          Yes aarakshan sucks
        
umeshranglani:
          Aarakshan is such a fucking bore !!! Even deepika isn't helping!
        
TheBOON4all:
          Did u like it ?? I dint in fact i hated d movie RT @M_I_N_T_Y: @TheBOON4all its was good.!!saw arakshan!
        
tailing2ideas:
          aarakshan has been a damp squid
        
Swapnil_Patil:
          Aarakshan is slow, 2 much of fundas, lack of firm stand on real issue n in the end wats the msg "Paid or Free..Coaching classes r cmplsry"!!
        
SWAPNILSOURAV1:
          Yesterday i watched Aarakshan-India Vs India,this movie did'nt completely justified the title,1st part was gud but aftr dat script got lost
        
SurenMK:
          #Aarakshan----screenplay let the film down.. watch it for the controversy it created
        
supriyabulbul:
          AARAKSHAN............grrrrr wht a thakau movie........bt hd a nic nap in d HALL :P
        
superravs:
          so many stars in aarakshan doin nothn except bigB n manoj bajpai...m really depressed bt prakshjha..he is goin vishal bhradwaj way.
        
ShivAroor:
          If the Govt *really* wants to subdue these #Lokpal mobs, it shld consider rounding them up & subjecting thm to a pvt screening of #Aarakshan
        
SahilBulla:
          Just saw Arakshan. 99% of my mind was reserved on Not Paying Attention. #truestory
        
sachinbhandary:
          Aarakshan is decent cinema but not worth all the furore, it does not even compel you to think about this issue which could shape our future.
        
qosmioamit:
          Aarakshan is a brilliantly scripted movie about reservation in Indian educational institutions. A spectacular performance by @SrBachchan
        
priyank2685:
          had hema malini not intervened d movie aarakshan wud hve nvr ended.. thank u hemaji :-)
        
Preitymishra:
          'Aarakshan' is just a headache.
        
pkkaushik2:
          Aarakshan not Worth of hike provided !
        
nalinv:
          Watched Aarakshan yesterday.Great script in 1st half, 2nd half a let down. Saif and Prateik a waste. @srbacchan and Manoj Bajpai Superb.7/10
        
monil12:
          with the hot topic like reservation, Prakash Jha failed this time to prove the pt in #aarakshan with loosely based story line & reality
        
moharerprakash:
          watched AARAKSHAN last night. not impressed at all. performances were superb but d vision was blurred. .
        
mayureshnirhali:
          Arakshan - the worst movie of Prakash Jha. Only @SrBachchan does his bit.
        
mayankgupta86:
          #aarakshan is a bad movie, big b actually gav half n hour coaching in the movie, damn my bloody lectures wer better not tht #boring
        
MadhavMatters:
          Arakshan is a super yuck movie
        
kritikaramani:
          Aarakshan - mega confooshion movie
        
korr_06:
          Finally watched aarakshan, to my disappointment the title of the mov had nothing to with the same!! Just another Bollywood way of makin mov!
        
JWalia:
          Couldn't agree more! RT @nidhibains: #aarakshan is off subject and Prateik's acting is horrible.
        
JeetenSheth:
          Aarakshan is a BS movie!! Still wondering whats the agenda!!
        
janhaviM:
          in aarakshan the issue of reservation was spoken about for a max of 15mins!the rest of the movie made absolutely no sense!
        
IshanSaluja:
          IMO #Aarakshan would've been a way better movie if they'd chosen to go deep with one issue rather than skim a dozen or two.
        
indolianeeraj:
          A confused script,unimpressive direction by mr. Jha,n a couple of poor performances of by everybody except bachhan sahab!#arakshan
        
im_adi:
          #aarakshan Has happened. And im feeling like cheated.
        
implex:
          Aarakshan a totally confused movie. Great Star Cast. That's it.
        
hrkeni:
          #Aarakshan - How to NOT handle a sensitive issue and turn it into a melodramatic farce.
        
HarshalBhandare:
          Aarakshan:Such a good subject but wasted in clueless direction & script. Surprised how saif accepted this role for couple of dialogues.
        
hanariaz:
          But the ending was a flop, remedial education isn't enough. We need to redo the education system entirely #equality #aarakshan #bollywood
        
guptasukriti:
          Aarakshan is such a poorly made film. "QED" ! Ha!
#sucks
        
gauravgupta:
          Aarakshan is only about aarakshan till the interval. After that it becomes more of "tabela bachao". My rating- 0/5
        
Gaali_Leo:
          Aarakshan is worst than the most boring lectures I've ever attended in college. Total chutiya movie.
        
foram1011:
          Below average- aarakshan! Though storyline is good bt da tough hindi language makes a viewer go off to sleep
        
Finelychopped:
          Can I sue the Arakshan makers for using my initials? And boring us to death?
        
epic_n00b:
          Aarakshan: Ratings 1.5/5,movie is 30% time wasted in BS of quota system & 70% wasted in Amitabh vs Manoj Bajpai fight of commercial classes
        
durgapal:
          'Aarakshan' (CRAP Movie) - nothing to do with reservation but more to do with private coaching centers and state of education in India.
        
drrohanjain:
          prakash jha should have been more bold to show the truth of aarakshan...!!
        
deepikah:
          Aarakshan has totally lost the plot after interval. *yawn*
        
dedhpase:
          Aarakshan is a confused movie...not in the same league as some of other prakash jha work..
        
chipku_chamiya:
          Arakshan-aaaaahhhh my brain hurts!!
        
BreakingViews4u:

Bhanu025:
          Watched Aarakshan. Bad movie, and honestly the title should have been on "Coaching class".Why  "Aarakshan" used?
        
axisparashuram:
          Jha has failed to make his mark in Arakshan like in Apaharan & Rajneeti, weak justification in the script.doing well b'coz of Media hype
        
arunajain786:

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.The principled principal of a college gets himself caught in between the two sides of the reservation argument. And suddenly he sees the root of the evil in the parallel commercial education system.The principled principal of a college gets himself caught in between the two sides of the reservation argument.

Background music in the titles.
I don't necessarily have a musical ear, but I think the theme music starts with the notes of "vaishnav jan to". I thought that fit in well with the theme of the film.
Some of the dialogues had an awesome punch. 
The scene where Prabhakar (Amitabh Bachchan) dismisses Poorbi's (Deepika Padukone) sacrifice as collateral damage.

Some of the words used by Deepika Padukone and Saif Ali Khan like "sthir". Didn't go well with the characters or the flow of the dialogue at all.
Manoj Bajpai's wig.
Awful cuts. There was no way to keep track of the timeline. Have minutes passed by between two scenes or days? Some lines/scenes could be interpreted as both. 
When did Deepak (Saif Ali Khan) change his decision about not going to the US?
The whole house being taken over business! How can a person who has no agreement with the owner of a property legally give the property away on rent!? Didn't make sense at all!
A phone number from US starts with 9122. Come on!
@Kapil oh yeah! Mausam is certainly something i'm looking forward to. Have always enjoyed Pankaj Kapur's work. Fingers crossed. Btw, I read somewhere that Prakash Jha refused to have a special screening of Aarakshan for politicians. Made me smile!Waiting to watch Aarakshan. Good concept. I love the trailer. Thanks for the details of the movie.@moviebhakt apparently not!Really looking forward to this movie.Taran Adarsh's review of Aarakshan - http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/movies/review/14307/index.htmlThis time your conclusion remark went straight above your review, i guess the movie really tested your patience to a such extent that your still having the hangover on our shoulders. As usual your review is  very subjective and clear Meetu . I think the caste conscious will really be agitated now as the makers used their social prejudice to gain publicity to such a meaningless film .@Rahul Now, what can I say? :)@lost_in_confusion I want to like every movie I watch. What to do?@guddu "went straight above your review" meaning?@lost_in_confusion Why not my cup of tea? I wanted to watch it, but I believe there were 4 releases that week and I had gotten my wisdom tooth extracted, so was in - let's just call it - PAIN. I do intend to review it when it comes on TV.@TimELiebe Actually, it isn't about taking a side, the only bit in the film I liked was the part where the two sides were making their points. About addressing stars...ha ha ha ha! I had this huge problem when I started reviewing. How can i just call Amitabh Bachchan, Amitabh Bachchan...if nothing else, at least add a "ji", i thought. But, now I'm just used to it, I guess. They are human beings, no? :PSigh ... one more movie that I won't have to bother about hunting on the torrents. And before I get chastised, no Bollywood movie releases where I live. :)I was talking about the conclusion remark that critics usually add after completng their reviews just as a tagline . This time I felt you wrote it above your review"The huh!? expression I've carried ever since the film ended is now expanded into a full question - If just the title of a film can cause an outrage big enough for the film to be banned in some areas of the country, what will happen if the film actually ends up being about the issue it is named after? We'll have to wait for another film to find out.Unless, of cours". I think this should have been written at the end , it went sort of displaced.Tim i wasn't talking about racially overloaded terms controversy which made your western friends so exciting . The movie is more of an institutional  racism but it never showcased the plight of SC/ST people in modern India for which the movie went banned in most of the states. I feel pity for those Politicians who became the victim of this kind of shameless marketing strategy .@TimeLiebe Prabhakar Anand (Amitabh Bachchan) is saying everyone is entitled to "proper" education - not the education that lets you score well but leaves you clueless about the concepts.The rich can get it with facilities, the poor should have an avenue where they can educated themselves from within their means. And in that, the teachers should recognize they are in a noble profession and shouldn't make a business out of education. (the link is still not working)@vivek that's awesome!!@Shashank I totally sympathize with your situation. What the movie was against and is true in real life too is - that the teachers manipulate in such a manner that children have to go to coaching classes. Either they are school teachers and don't teach "properly" in schools or they teach only in coaching classes because that is more lucrative.@kapil ow! that's too bad that you had to watch the movie forcibly. Also I'm willing to bet the people who banned this movie haven't watched it at all!@guddu wow! you will not believe how much time I spent in considering whether that should be the first para or the last!!@Aarak oh well, one can hope, no? but i disagree with the bit about multiplex cinema vs hardhitting films. I dont;t hink the multiplex audience is averse to films that make a point. I think the makesrs just got this one all wrong.@Rema like! And agree.Aarakshan is a fabulous movie.this movie show the importance of reservation .we will request each and every body to see the movie in watch-hindi-moviesAarakshan is a fabulous movie.this movie show the importance of reservation .we will request each and every body to see the movie in watch-hindi-moviesCopyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
