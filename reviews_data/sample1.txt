wogma rating: Even the keen, wait for it to come on TV/online (?)
Too convoluted, too long, too slow together make a potentially interesting and fun thriller barely bearable.Blackmail’s trailer indicates that it could be a quirky movie with weird plot twists that movies with crime-gone-wrong usually have. Blackmail is wacky and has those weird plots. But, the zany business is not all good and the plot gets too convoluted. The other stuff is slow, repetitive and even derisive. That leaves you with the interesting one-line plot – a dull and bored man finds out his wife is cheating on him and decides to blackmail the wife’s lover who in turn blackmails the wife (yes, his lover), with a few other blackmailers thrown in. When expanded, this plot is intentionally filled with ludicrous situations and reactions that want to get a laugh out of you. But, as a person who never understood adult comedy or toilet humor (unless it’s the Piku kind), it is very difficult for me to find masturbation or an obsession with toilet paper funny. Maybe the former is with an intention to point fingers at how real life is for some men but it is too repetitive and thus predictable, for it to be satirical either. Same goes for the relentless objectification and misogyny.Even so, if the movie had been crisper and pacier, the one-line plot might just have worked. It doesn’t help that plot-wise, almost everything that happens until interval, is what you already know from the trailer!While the dialogue is not entertaining or engaging, as a saving grace in the writing department Dev, the protagonist’s (Irrfan Khan) lines are conspicuous by their absence. The man has no more than 20-25 lines in the movie. It must take credible restrain for a writer to let the actor take over without their help. And anyone who has seen his work would know what a treat such a character can be when its played by the likes of Irrfan Khan. So, Dev comes across as creepy within the first few minutes of the film. This is Irrfan Khan who has recently announced that he might be diagnosed with something serious. Yet, the man makes you cringe with his onscreen depiction of a person with a distasteful habit. Enough for you to not empathize with him for being cheated on by his wife. Other than the fact that all other actors are likely to fall pale when compared to this performance, it doesn’t even feel like any of them are trying. We have seen Gajraj Rao, Divya Dutta and Omi Vaidya play characters similar to these – quirky, drunken loud and annoying – respectively, for us to remember them in this particular film. Kirti Kulhari wears the same expression through and through. The only standout then would by Arunoday Singh who does his usual dumb, goofball act in the first half, but later in the film he has one scene which takes him beyond anything we have seen him do so far. The music that is used well in the first half hour or so becomes repetitive and tedious through most of the run-time thereafter. Not to mention the item number lengthens and slows down the film by that much more.Blackmail spends too much time to introduce its protagonist and takes too long to establish its basic premise. It actually squeezes out ounce-by-ounce all the interest you came in with because of the trailer and/or the lead actor. It is the kind of film that is not interested in you liking any of the characters, they are all rather nasty people. Is that what the makers are saying, there are no nice people in the world? But, to say that they had that thought behind the story, I would be giving too much credit to them.

        ...On the whole, BLACKMAIL is quite an unconventional entertainer and a good black comedy. It may not have a pan India appeal but the target multiplex audience are sure to enjoy this flick. The costs of this film are reasonable and as a result, it’ll turn out to be a profitable venture for its producers.

        ...Irrfan is effortlessly at ease in a role that has him playing patsy while enshrining the diabolical within. Kirti Kulhari makes a definite impact without being too obvious about it. Arunoday Singh may have the weakest role here, but he delivers what his director expected of him with aplomb. Divya Dutta, the most underrated actress in Hindi cinema today is definitely the best thing to happen to Blackmail, after Irrfan. She is so natural here that it’s difficult to see her as anything but… a drunk, dominating shrew. This black comedy may have started off in grubby everyday monotony but when it picks up midway through its runtime, it packs enough of a punch to make you forget the ennui.

This is one of the most wickedly funny films that we’ve seen in a long time.

        ...Unlike Deo-directed Delhi Belly! Blackmail's black comedy lacks pace and absurdity for viewers to be entirely sold to the events. Plot contrivance comes in as all characters indulge in blackmailing far too easily and with little repercussions. You stick around for the Irrfan show and he doesn't disappoint.

        ...Though it has a sizzling set up and some smart dialogue written by Pradhuman Singh Mall, Blackmail soon descends into silliness, a fallout of the lack of smarts displayed by all the characters, an overstuffed screenplay and some slack editing. Screenwriter Parveez Sheikh and Deo have no intention of preaching (though there are subtle digs at the advertising industry) or providing a neatly tied-up morality lesson. It’s enjoyable to see each successive character reveal their grey nature, but in the end, the only person you root for is Dev. Irrfan uses his craft to quietly draw you into Dev’s frustration, his eyes and body language conveying a multitude of emotions. His lead turn is the highlight of Blackmail.

            Nay! Thumbs Down,
            by Fan
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.The only reason I went to watch this at the theatre was Irfan Khan.  But the film is a big disappointment.The trailer gives an impression of a nice concept where the blackmailer is blackmailed by the blackmailee, almost everyone aware that blackmailing is going on, death, intrigue.  The movie is far from all that.  Yes, the interesting concept of the blackmailer being blackmailed is there, but somehow it is not developed into an interesting watch.  What we then have is a random middle aged guy, [comment partially deleted because it gives a detail of the movie away] being dumped by his wife for a younger fellow.  The blackmailing follows, and even the blackmailer [comment partially deleted because it gives a detail of the movie away].  There are so many blackmailings going on that at the end of the movie I find it still difficult to figure out who made how much money and who lost how much money.The first 30-40 minutes of the movie are excruciatingly slow - thereafter the pace seems to be alright.  The characters are all typical stereotypes.  Irfan Khan as the common man, all with a typical middle class home with stickers of Richie Rich on the show cases, and unpainted walls.  Arunoday Singh, from his image that is stuck in my mind of a muscled idiot from Mein Tera Hero, seems to be doing the same character here - an idiot with blown up muscles.  Omi Vaidya too stereotyped into the US returned Indian.  Divya Dutt probably the only who is not stereotyped, and a pleasure to watch after a long time.  And speaking of long time, yes there is the forgettable item number performed by Urmila Matondkar, back on silver screen after a long time.The movie has twists, some innovative idea, but overall the theme of amateurs trying their hand at questionable and certainly criminal activities like blackmailing [comment partially deleted because it gives a detail of the movie away] falls flat.  Got better things in life then to watch this film.  One can easily give it the skip, even when on TV.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
