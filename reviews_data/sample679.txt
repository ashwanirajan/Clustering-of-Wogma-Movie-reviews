 Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu is a mildly likeable, sweet valentine gift in an "itâ€™s the thought that counts" way. There's a chance you'll like it better if you haven't seen the trailers, because the best gags are covered by them and thus take away from the movie-watching experience.Boy meets girl and turns out they are married. And they start working backwards. The basic problem with such a premise is we know how the film is going to end. The synopsis of the film, tries to build suspense with questions like - 
Will this friendship turn to love? Will her warmth and fearlessness give Rahul the courage to face a long-simmering confrontation with his parents? Will a marriage that started as a drunken mistake help two people find themselves?
Unfortunately, these questions are at best, rhetoric. Anyone who knows anything about Hindi films or Dharma Productions, will answer these questions with a yes, yes and a yes. So much so that, I'm willing to promise a rating higher by a couple of notches if the answer to any of these questions is "No." Come on, surprise me.  
Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu takes off on a very American sitcom-ish theme of people getting inadvertently married when drunk. While at it, it also seems to further its basic plot using the regular  stereotypical opposites - bold woman - shy man. 
Oh well. Meanwhile though, if these trailers are anything to go by Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu guarantees a few laughters and I'm pretty sure will keep me smiling through. The modern, hip, unabashed lead female character played by Kareena Kapoor also makes a self-referencing joke that's actually funny. It might even make a social remark with the woman being slightly older than the man of the film. The young director, Shakun Batra, promises fresh, everyday language of the young. 
What's more, it has a song with some lively music and lovely lyrics dedicated to women of my generation - auntyji! Especially auntyjis who are reluctant to dance. 

I'm all set to tap my feet with a smile on my face, even though I'd be more shocked than surprised and will definitely be pleased if the Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu gives me a climax different from what we all think it's going to be! Especially given that it's a Valentine's Day special.

  The biggest mistake I made was to have seen the trailers. You've seen the trailers, you've seen almost the first 30-40 minutes of the film because, the bits that don't make it to the promos are mere "fill in the blanks" to the punch lines. It's a good thing that those one-liners and the timing with which they are delivered, are perfect. And though almost the entire film is predictable, the climax deviates from the "regular" zone making the film two notches above what it might've been, as promised. The problem though is that the narrative throughout the film, seems drab and flat, and thus the film stays average. For all we know, it could be intentional because the film advocates being average.

In that sense,  Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu is more about parenting styles, the generation gap a restrictive style could create and society's constant insistence on being unique. As you discover the opposites that Riana (Kareena Kapoor) and Rahul (Imraan Khan) are, which is pretty prompt and in-the face, the thought never leaves you that a thick finger is being pointed at how they've been raised. And eventually, almost the entire second half becomes about how the wrong-doing parents are dealt with. And that bit doesn't deviate one bit from the expected. 
So, you spend a good portion of the first hour to get to the point where the trailers left us, get to the point and land up right in the middle of an annoying family squabble. Yet, most of the time you aren't complaining whole-heartedly because you are in good company. Kareena Kapoor and Imran Khan keep you entertained. Kareena Kapoor with her chirpy Riana Briganza is exactly Geet (Jab We Met) and she has always been a joy to watch. Especially, since she has mastered the art of stopping her 'happy' act where it might get 'trying to hard' and thus annoying. Such people in real life, do get overbearing, after all. Imraan Khan as the wannabe anal retentive, but easily slips into any form the other person wants him to take, does represent a section of our youth who are figuring out their identity. 
This lost identity bit makes the chemistry between the two fizzle off since most of the time, it feels like Riana is coaching Rahul as an older sister would. And automatically that converts Rahul into a younger brother because the mold his character is capable of shaping into, instantly wants him to be like her, like a younger sibling aspires to be like the older one. 
While  Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu might deviate from the standard at some places, at various others it takes on every new-world clichÃ© that we have been exposed to in the past decade or so. The extra-aspirational parents to the 'everything goes' parents - are all caricatures. Not to mention all of them are given either exaggerated situations or are over-acting. We also cannot deny that the 100%-guaranteed-chirpy-woman-of-the-film is also quickly falling into the clichÃ© zone. Sure, we all know enough of this type of a person. But now, her sole aim is to bring about a change in the typical, serious man of the film. And that's getting repetitive across films. 
Yet, I will look forward to director, Shakun Batra's next film. There were some strokes in character establishment that showed a glimpse of hope. Like the background music in the opening scene or the characters' self-description at the psychologists. Of course, there is naivetÃ© in other directorial decisions like say the whole Day 1 - Day X super-imposes. One - bad lift-off from 500 days of Summer; Two - why take on something like this if you're not going to use it wittingly throughout, are going to club days and give it the lamest every conclusion!
In many ways,  Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu is a trying hard to be Wake Up! Sid. Thematically, except for one change, the ingredients are pretty much the same. Woman in distress helped by the man; the man is provided with personal growth by this otherwise confident (older too!) woman; one piles-on at the other's home; one is finicky about cleanliness, other is not; a cute birthday; parents need to be confronted; a passion for photography and so on. But it's nowhere close to what its predecessor achieved. The one change is sweet and such shifts need to be encouraged because they draw from real life, but I've seen real-life situations which panned out with a lot more heart-tugging.

          To hell with your reviews, Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu, is a wonderful movie, for the first time, its not some silly chaotic love story ending!

chads_world:
          Really liked EMAET! It had a realistic ending. It doesn't always have to be a 'lived-happy-ever-after' ending.
        
BollyBrit:
          Loved #EMAET! Surprisingly its NOT a Kareena Kapoor film. It was an Imran Khan film with able support from
Kareena Kapoor! Great ending too!

Rehanajani:
          Ek Main Aur Ek Tu ..!! 2nd half much better than the 1st half.. Over all 3 star..!! #zoOmTV #Bollywood
        
RajBaddhan:
          Watched 'Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu' - unconventional ending, which was refreshing. Entertaining film but felt something was missing. Kareena fab!
        
Padhy02:
          Ekk main aur ek tu was a nice watch. Big boring in bits but overall a fairly decent movie.
        
nadeem_gunner:
          Fair movie ek main Aur ek tu :p
        
melittlepixie:
          It's a staple rom-com, date-flick Makes you smile and hum along. It's all candy-floss and la-dee-dah. Sweet though - Ek main aur ek tu
        
KaviAngel:
          Ek Main Aur Ek Tu has a beautiful beginning. But the after interval half sucks....
        
iam4srk:

divyaunny:
          Emaet was sweet. Nothing fantabulous, but fresh.
        
Decloned_iTaz:
          But I like the Ekk Main Aur Ek Tu's unexpected ending. Kareenas character portrayal was path breaking if only it was executed well.
        
VineethAkki:
          R u out of ur mind  y did u make EMET it's rubbish

TheWovenDreams:
          Saw Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu.. Must say a very below average movie. Expected something a lot better!
        
taranjeets1ngh:
          Ek Main aur ek tu is no Jab we met, high on production values, however a very slow moving story, wish it had high energy, could have been...
        
tanvitricky:
          Ek main aur ekk tu was super disappointing!

          Ek Main aur ekk tu - highly overrated. 4 star! Waw! Seriously ?

saralovesdb:
          ek main aur ek tu was boring...because both kareena and imran were sycho's

          Anjaana Aanjaani, i thot was the worst concept , But EMAET proved me wrong....
        
PRyali:
          #EMAET Some humor n a nonsence story line. Would have been so much better if it ended differently.
        
PotterLover7:
          Ek Main aur Ek Tu.. Quite boring, honestly! The first have was alright, but it got boring by the end! -.-

          Went for ek main aur ek tu yesterday. So terrible that my brain still hasn't forgiven me. Refuses to wake up. #Review
        
NanditaMehta:
          I don't understand the good reviews around me. #EMAET left me with a very 'huh' feeling!
        
Mehta_Nirav:
          Ek Main Aur Ek Tu is just a poor man's Jab We Met. And by poor I mean pre-NREGA poor #EMAET
        
manish_bindal:
          Ek main aur ek tu - dull and boring

          "Ek Main Aur Ek Tu" Proper Hathoda Please don't bother to west your time
        
LizaSaha:
          Ek Main Aur Ek Tu proved to be another over hyped romantic movie. Seemed like a repeat cocktail of many such love stories. #perfectlyaverage

Grow a pair and go to a strip club.

danyalmian123:
          Ek Main Aur Ek tu is a shit movie.. I suggest people not to watch it...:(
        
codelust:
          EMAET is over-stylized and draggy. The last 15-minutes salvage it to a tiny extent. No chemistry between the lead duo.
        
babajika_ghanta:
          Watched the worst movie ever last night. My head still hurts. Ek main aur ek tu. fuck you.
        
ankeetachawla:
          Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu kinda sucked.. Kareena tried to repeat her role of the fun crazy woman in jab we met. Boring the second time.
        
AbhinavBhatt01:
          watched the movie EMAET as a friend insisted. My reaction 'Yawn' and 'hmmpff ok'.

The background music of the opening scene.
Rahul's father's (Boman Irani) lines, that implied pressure. Unfortunately, I know such parents in real life. 
Kareena Kapoor's entry - just because it was non-dramatic.
The casual manner in which a taboo subject as a visit to the psychologist was introduced.
Kareena Kapoor's giggly laughter when she finds out what happens between Imraan and Anusha.
Imraan Khan's pansy hand movements when he gestures that he is shy just pre-interval. Rather cute, moreso because it goes with the character. 

For a kid who read, "Freud for beginners" Rahul seemed very uninitiated. Good joke, but misplaced.
The kapaal-bhaarti sequence.
Rahul (Imraan Khan) rehearsing the explanation of annulment. 
The Japanese interview
The day at spa - such a nice idea, but such dull dialogues and events.
The attempt at sex and humor in the loo scene.
Rahul from 2012 dancing to a song by Rahul from 1998. So not happening!
Rahul's big realization that is very abrupt.
The suitcase closing scene. The innuendo was so lame given the context of the film.
The light on/off scene - how tiring!
Enjoyed your review! I'm looking forward to watching this movie - in the meantime I got a chance to interview Zenobia Shroff who plays Kareena's mom in the movie and is part of the hilarious Auntyji item number. You can see the interview here -http://bit.ly/wJfCxCThanks Lavina!Thanks Vishal! I am looking at options but at the same time I love my freedom to choose what and when I want to write. Besides, the pay is usually not enough to give up on these things. :DMy American friends and I liked the movie for how it didn't end (well, except for my wife and Bruce Coville's wife) - and I really hope by saying that that I'm not being "spoilerish" again. Kareena Kapoor played yet another life-affirming woman buzzsawing her way through some uptight guy's life - but yes, she was less initially annoying here than she was as Geet in JAB WE MET. Imran Khan did a wonderful job as a young man who was always hemmed in by expectations to the point where he could barely breathe - so to see him break loose was nice, and that gave poignancy to the movie's ending. We've seen a few movies starring Imran Khan by now, and they often seem aimed at a younger, better-educated and less traditional audience. While they still have song&dance; numbers (which is something masala should never lose, and Western movies and television could definitely benefit from more of!), they're presented with a bit more awareness that it's a filmi convention - and they often take other similar conventions and invert them or use them in a humorous or self-aware manner.@TimELiebe another case of 'to each his own' i guess. As I see it, I've had an overdose of masala and need it to be in my film in just the right proportion :)@TimELiebe :) spot on! We'll know in a few years?Copyright Â© 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
