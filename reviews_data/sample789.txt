
wogma rating: Watch if you have nothing better to do (?)
Our parents lecture us. And we are bored of the sermons. So, what do we do? Go to the theater and have 18-year old non-actors preach to us how we shouldn't nag our children. Oh wait, and just in case you didn't get the point, THE Shah Rukh Khan, will come and patronize the same pill down your throat. "Always Kabhi Kabhi" What is that? What in goodness' name is that? Who talks like that? To top it off have smirky thoughtful Shah Rukh Khan go, "kabhi kabhi aapne socha hai ki aap school mein always kya karte the?" (Sometimes have you wondered what you always did in school? - sounds weird in Hindi.) It just sounds wrong, even if it might be in its own way, grammatically correct. 
But then again, maybe Shah Rukh Khan is talking to the grammatically-challenged generation. Oh wait! But isn't he asking the question in past tense which would mean he's talking to school pass-outs like us. gulp Sounds very confused. Anyway, if the Shah Rukh Khan bits of this promo aren't a complete turn-off for you, we belong to different parts of the audience. Oh well...


Unfortunately, the rest of the trailer, or even the other promos, don't hold much promise. The entire setup and the details in terms of individual lines sound like they are working too hard to impress. Maybe like the generation the movie seems to be portraying. On the other hand, campus romance and masti has huge potential to refresh your mind with jubilant youthful characters. Something that could take you back to your time in school. I'm hoping against hope that it doesn't end up being juvenile. Because that's how the music sounds for sure.

  Late teens. Most of us are old enough to get nostalgic about them. We had a tough time. We obeyed. We rebelled. Always Kabhi Kabhi picks four of us and tells our story. Or rather tries to. Because, for our stories to make it to films, they need to be exaggerated. And the hyperbole goes wary because it makes the same mistake our parents made or we as parents might make. Nag, rant, berate.

The set-up, the problems chosen, the build-up weren't bad at all. From the over-attentive, selfish parent to the perennially disappointed dad to the missing-in-action socialite-parents - they have it all covered. But the second half takes you into a drastic overdo of either silly lover's tiffs or situations that are beyond unreasonable. 
To top it off, we have lame dialogue and amateurish delivery. I liked Zoa Morani the best. She was the only one who carried off the attitude assigned to her - "whatever".  The two boys, Ali Fazal and Satyajeet Dubey are just about tolerable. Though it might be my intolerance of chocolate-boy-looks and pretentious cuteness coming through here. Same goes for Giselle Monteiro. But at least her character came across as believable. 
The lasting impact though is of only "blah". It doesn't remain the chick-flick it starts out as, nor does it execute the message it wants to put across well. A similar point was much, much better executed in F.A.L.T.U. That each of us has a right to our own dreams. That just because one generation liked Shakespeare, doesn't mean generations and generations later he still has to be played out in the same vein. But what a ridiculous cop-out they chose to go with!?
Maybe all of this would have worked if they showed, and didn't tell. And then just for good measure, have King Khan spell it out to us again in the end credits. I guess, we should thank him and our stars, that he didn't show up as one of the 18-year olds.

          Always Kabhi Kabhi - Nandhani as tomb-boy was the best though the other 3 were equally good... Watchable at least once...

          It takes Dhobighat, Shaitan & Shor In The City to take Indian cinema 3 steps forward. but 1 Always Kabhi Kabhi to push it 4 steps backward.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.I thought this movie looked crappy  the moment I saw the trailer.@Limette sounds about right! ;)@Shashank thanks! though i'm not yet used to watching and writing 3 reviews in a day. it becomes a little too much. either i'll stop it or get used to it, we'll see. :D@Nishchaiy i don't give number ratings to the film. The rating is "Watch if you have nothing better to do" The SRK connection is that this film is produced by his wife's production house.@Nishchaiy i haven't seen "rok sako to rok lo"Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
