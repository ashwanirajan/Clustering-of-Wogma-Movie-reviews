Except for a difficult performance by Kareena Kapoor and the lost character she plays, Heroine is one dramatic scene after another without anything substantial. The opening line of the trailer says that all heroines in the film industry – Hollywood or Bollywood – are moody, crazy and over-emotional. So, if you are expecting anything non-stereotypical out of Heroine, your expectations are set to order even before you begin to think of the film. Anyway, we don't expect Madhur Bhandarkar to go deeper than what we already know of the worlds he is delving into. But, what I have liked about Madhur Bhandarkar's Traffic Signal, Fashion and even Jail, is that the story is engaging. The ups and downs of the protagonists, however predictable, are depicted while holding my interest. Somehow though, Heroine doesn't look like it is going to go beyond Fashion. How much more different are the stories really going to be? And despite being pretty much sure that, like many others I am looking forward to a meaty performance by Kareena Kapoor. If there is one area in which we cannot complain about when it comes to a Madhur Bhandarkar film, it is the scope it provides for its lead character. Unfortunately, this time around the music is disappointing. The first time I read a tweet from Salim Merchant (Salim-Sulaiman duo) announcing the song 'Halkat jawani', it was annoying, because I for one, have had enough of these item numberesque songs with slang that is used just for the ring the words have to them. Anyway, I don't mind if Heroine is a decent, enjoyable story though I wouldn't expect an indepth peek into 'the' industry. Music Reviews:
Milliblog - "typical, lethargic and tedious Bhandarkar’ishness."
Music Aloud – "6/10"
dunkdaft – "disappoints by a soundtrack that has nothing notable to offer."
Bollywood Hungama – "3/5"
Bollyspice – "3/5"
Apun Ka Choice – "3.5/5"
Happy Sing - "even though not really make me believe in Salim-Sulaiman, is fairly okay."

  Welcome to the world of 'babes', one-upmanship, over-reaction. Welcome to the cut-throat world of the Hindi film industry, Bollywood. Or so you are made to believe. Heroine doesn't sink in any deeper than these two lines. However, like a Madhur Bhandarkar film, it does spend quite some time with its lead character, Mahi Arora (Kareena Kapoor). Mahi's character builds interestingly but unfortunately her story has nothing out of the ordinary to hold the film together. It's almost as if the character wasn't written but just happened to happen. It's great that Heroine picks not a typical top star as his lead character, nor is she a struggling actress who's rise we see from the very beginning. Her journey is told to us from somewhere in the middle. At a point in which she's most distraught and finds her way to a police station for a reason that is not told to us immediately and when you do find out, you can't believe the pettiness of the issue. I doubt the character or the writer/director knew why she was there. But meanwhile, Kareena Kapoor gets to insecure, distraught, failure, glamorous of course and bipolar! Though she seemed more depressed than bipolar, but hey that's nitty-gritty, right? But, the point here is that whatever Kareena is asked to do, she works really hard in getting it right. She looks gorgeous even when she is dispirited. And I mean this in a good way. She takes every opportunity she can get and the labor shows. It is not an effortless performance.The character offers her enough layers too - a woman who wants to do well in her career and is a decent human being too. But as it turns out, even if she is willing to put in her best, try everything within her control and resist from sinking low, it's not enough. And after all, she is a woman and thus is needy. There are other times, where Mahi behaves aggressively, over-reacts and takes actions the repercussions of which she hasn't taken into account. Interestingly, the only really good looking actress in the entire clutter of 'top' heroines in Heroine is Mahi. The rest, aren't half as magnificent. Yet, she struggles as a 'star', if not a beginner. For a change, you also have the male leads in sensitive roles, who have their own shades of gray, however unbaked they are. None of the other side characters add any meaning to the film except for maybe Shahana Goswami's Promita.With such textures, you'd hope the story would hold your interest. It meanders, it stretches, it disengages you from the characters. And towards the end it just gets overbearing. And at times, you feel like some sequences, especially ones revolving around sexuality, have been added just to titillate without much relevance to the story. The run-of-the-mill songs slow the film down too. The two and a half hours run-time doesn't help its case either. There is this underlying equation that Madhur Bhandarkar seems to point at, which is annoying as his audience, because it comments about the audience. While belittling the hard-work that people put in their work, Heroine implies that the entire film industry lives in a cut-throat environment where manipulation is the key to success. They do it to so their films do well with the masses. And the masses supposedly decide the fate of a film depending on the controversy surrounding it. Full stop. There is no if or but there, the question about the film's quality or content is a distant one. The audience's love for their cinema is based solely on the associated scandals. And what is poor media to do but to report on these with dramatic effect if that's what the audience wants. !?!? Really? Is that what we are? Naïve and basically stupid. Whatever. What it all boils down to then is the same question we could ask about most Bhandarkar products – Is Madhur Bhandarkar's Heroine about "Bollywood - behind the scenes" or is it telling us the story of its heroine, her ups, downs and in-betweens? If its the former, you'd get more out of reading your city's daily edition let alone film magazines. And if it's the latter, atypically so, Bhandarkar doesn't engage despite having his heroine perform to the best of her capabilities.

Bhandarkar doesn’t really want to tell us a story, he just wants to string together incidents that allow him to comment on the film industry, take potshots at a couple of people and insert dialogue like “he has the hot for you babe” (yes, not hots, but hot)....

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.The ups and downs in the life of an actress, Mahi Arora (Kareena Kapoor) from the Hindi film industry and the struggle she has to go through to remain in the game.The ups and downs in the life of an actress, Mahi Arora (Kareena Kapoor) from the Hindi film industry and the struggle she has to go through to remain in the game.
That women in her life empower Mahi – her therapist, her publicist and her Bengali co-star.
The way Mahi handles sexual overtures.
Kareena Kapoor's eagerness at being a good actress in the Bengali director's film. 
Kareena Kapoor in ethnic wear – simply gorgeous.

The opening sequence. And the way it connects later. Pretty lame. 
The title song sounded like title songs of thrillers.
The journalist as a narrator. 
Abbas Khan (Sanjay Suri) shows up at every party and yet he is introduced with another character telling him how he never attends parties. 
The therapy scenes. A psychiatrist prescribes medicines under duress? Really?
Top stars behaving like college boys when talking about new heroines in the industry.
The lame image-building formula put down by Mahi's publicist (Divya Dutta)
The Bengali film world caricature, sure it was funny, but too much stereotyping.
Angad (Randeep Hooda) complaining about losing a year as if his biological clock is ticking!

Lovely jhumkas (hooped earrings) worn by most women through the film.
Promo looks good, hope it's not just another typical style of Madhur film....@Silvan, yeah let's hope so!I do not have any special reason to hope for anything different than the usual Bhandarkar template... but being a Bebo fan, I hope she makes the most of it (though am sure comparisons with 'Fashion' and Priyanka will be inevitable, and Bebo will turn up at the losing end :P)Bahut intezaar karaa rahe ho aap :P@B H Harsh lo ji!:)Hi Meetu, Thanks for the review.  I want to ask one question. How different do you find this movie from Fashion?  In terms of the main character, the general theme, the sequence of events etc. Thanks!:( Poor Kareena , her efforts went entirely wasted due to lack of interesting plot. Had it been made in an explosive way, the film might wouldn't felt so boring and lame.It was a tiresome experience watching except for some humor and intimate scenes. I feel bad for Kareena , and i hope she won't disappoint us again.The movie is surely worth a watch. If anybody thinks that it's similar to fashion. Then he/she might be wrong. I watched it with some of my friends at Wave Cinemas and I happened to like it a lot. In fact, all my friends liked it way too much. The movie proved nice in terms of the story depiction but one thing that I felt about it was that the other characters somehow got lost in it. This didn't happen with fashion and I think that was the reason why it got so much of acclamation. And heroine focussed just on Kareena's role. The only downfall point I felt.@Lil The overall broad stroke is similar, but there are a few differences. I found Fashion a much stronger story of its protagonist.@guddu oh well..@Sanya Yep, there are some similarities and some slight differences with Fashion.Direction: 2    Story: 3    Lead Actors: 3    Character Artists: 2    Dialogues: 2    Screenplay: 1    Music Director: 0    Lyrics: 1@ligne yeah, pretty much. But, I liked the fact that she was all grey and was trying to figure herself out. Only problem was they didn't take it further. :(Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
