Almost all attempts at humor seem forced. A Punjabi girl brings a Pakistani guy home as the one she wants to marry. Siyapaa indeed - that, I am told, means trouble, lots of it. There's lots of potential for serious melodrama or rib-tickling gags or nasty India-Pakistan one-liners. Total Siyapaa seems to aim for some regular rom-com stuff. Which brings up the question - why have the India-Pakistan angle at all then?Now, here lies my hope once again, that I am pre-judging wrong. I hope there is something more to Total Siyapaa than just the regular romcom stuff. Fortunately, there is reason enough to have hope. This one is written by the writer/director of a movie I loved, A Wednesday. A completely different genre, which makes it even more intriguing. It doesn't make the fact that Ali Zafar is jarring as an actor any more tolerable though. But, hopefully, Yami Gautam will engage as she did in Vicky Donor. Kirron Kher seems to be doing her usual loud, Punjabi thing. Only this time, she seems to have better lines. These are then countered by crass jokes in the form of whatever it is Anupam Kher and the grandfather(?) (separately) are up to in the trailer. With all of the fors and againsts and its average music, Total Siyapaa just might be an average flick that brings in a few laughs, nothing more, nothing less. Music Reviews:
Bollyspice - "2.5/5" 
Bollywood Hungama - "2.5/5" 
Milliblog - "Ali offering a good demonstration of his multi-facetedness." 
Music Aloud - "7/10"

  Total Siyapaa reminded me of Hrishikesh Mukherjee films in many ways. A quirkily different situation in a regular family; the story of the film spans a short time - in this case just a day; all infused with humor. Unfortunately, the last bit doesn't work too well for Total Siyapaa. The attempt at humor is pretty mediocre and falls flat almost all along the way.There are a couple of times that the lines are really funny and will get a huge laugh out of you. But, other than that, all you do is wonder what is happening and why? This could actually be true of any film with quirky characters and situations. The difference though is that in the ones that are well made, you don't wonder, you just let go and enjoy.Total Siyapaa is something that you just sit through. In the right frame of mind, it won't seem bad enough that you are enduring it. But, it does have immense potential do that to you. The characters just aren't engaging. It then is all left to the situations, the dialogue and the actors. The situation of an Indian girl, Asha (Yami Gautam) bringing home a Pakistani boy, Aman (Ali Zafar) had lots of potential to go either way. To either be out-of-the-world hilarious or to go all jingoistic on you. Fortunately and/or unfortunately it doesn't do either. And as most middle grounds are, it becomes boring.Other than Anupam Kher who is hilarious in his short appearance, the other supporting cast more-or-less overacts. Yami Gautam doesn't have too much to do and Ali Zafar hams as usual. For some reason, I always find Ali Zafar's dubbing off, it comes out way too loud and seems affected. As with most films that seem funny in the trailers, Total Siyapaa exhausts all its funny lines in its two-minute trailer. As we expected and yet, sad.

          Total siyapa ....  Not that good though (@ Orbit Multiplex) https://foursquare.com/harneev/checkin/531b28bc498ecf22bc2a67df?s=7df6ob_9_l4-hkIRJDwkP3DPEoA&ref;=tw

gauravvasdev1:
          Total Siyapaa is not worth your money and time. You can make a Indo-Pak comedy without direct jokes on Pakistan.
        
GaurangAf7:
          Total siyapaa was just total #chutiyapa !! Utter bullshit is da word !! Am sorry @LiveForTheBass for forcing you to come along ! Haha
        
FlippedGarfield:
          Total Siyapaa happened. What a let down.
        
fenilpandya:
          Till now I though that "siyapaa" in the movie total siyapaa was used in place of "chutiyapa" to make it not sound vulgar . Lol
        
fayazshaikh:
          total siyapaa. Boring.
        
dhunji:
          The makers of Total Siyapaa must be laughing at people who go to see the film.*We titled the film Total Siyapaa and yet they went to see it*
        
denley86:
          Watched Total Siyapaa only for @AliZafarsays! Agreed, the film was boring but just loved the leads and of course Kirron Kher.
        
DeeKayBoss:

Casual_stranger:

BwoodUncensored:

Anusha__k:
          Total siyapaa was such a stupid movie omg
        
AneeshChandoke:
          Ali Zafar is such an underrated actor. Why he is doing average movies goes over my head.Total Siyapaa is avg just coz of him otherwise poor.
        
alizaidi2002:
          Ali Zafar's London, Paris, New York was ok.. Chashme Baddoor, I stopped the film within 15 minutes. and Total Siyapaa I walked out of.
        
aey:
          Total Siyapaa is total mind ka siyapaa. Don't waste money. Sasti tareen film.
        
adiratan:
          What was Neeraj Pandey thinking while making Total Siyapa? It is a disaster. Not what you expect from a person like him after 2 good movies.
        No readers have rated this movie yet.This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.3 ways aren't "many ways" in case of Mr. Mukherjee's films.@moviebhakt oh dear, it is a manner of speaking. The overall story reminded me time and again of Hrishikesh Mukherjee films. Doesn't mean I didn't laugh at myself for coming up with that analogy, but it is what it is. :DCopyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
