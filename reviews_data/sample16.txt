A quiet film that aims to simmer uneasiness within. But, alternating between showing life in a village and telling a story, Kadvi Hawa manages to pace itself too unevenly to create impact. You want to shy away from watching the entire length of the trailer. The farmers are in pain – and it is just too much to watch. Drought and floods are both taking their tolls on farming. The farmers blame the nature, but why is nature behaving this way? Who are the real culprits? No, we don’t want to hear the answer.Both Ranveer Shorey and Sanjai Mishra seem to be at the top of their game. Even in the two minutes you see them here, you can see the farmers’ frustration. Yes, the movie will be uncomfortable for the brain and the heart. And yes, it will have to be seen for those very reasons.Kadvi Hawa releases on 24 November, 2017.

  The opening sequences of Kadvi Hawa exposed my affinity to the colour and texture of dry, desert sand. The aridity is gorgeious, to the extent that I can smell it. Maybe it is the Rajasthani blood – for I haven’t ever lived in Rajasthan. Or maybe it is because I am not a farmer who suffers at the hands of drought. This is the kind of insensitivity Kadvi Hawa aims to point an accusatory finger at. Unfortunately, it spends too much time in showing us the village life that the intense, human story has little space to take hold. Kadvi Hawa treats the intense tragedies of drought and floods with the same aloofness as city-dwellers would treat it, “Yes, we know there are problems. Yes, they are grave. Yes, they require attention. It’s sad, very sad. But, they are not our problems. We have our own.” And it is quite human to do so, right? That is exactly what Hedu (Sanjay Mishra) and Gunu (Ranvir Shorey) do too. To alleviate themselves from their misery, they are okay with taking down someone else. But, each one has an extent to which they would do so. Both of them, stop short of going all the way. And this is brought about beautifully in the film.Alas, all this happens only in the second half. The entire first half is spent in setting up the scene for us. Look, they have no electricity. Look, they have no schools. Look, they have no water. Look at these other people, they have too much water. Look, the government is spending its time in sweeping macro changes when little is changing at the ground level. This would have all worked really well, had the story gone on along side. While the mute, still non-movement of the film had its own charm, it didn’t work for the film. And this treatment is a mystery because the story had so much going for it. The things people on both sides of the story were doing to stay afloat by itself was engaging. While one came across as mean, as an audience you could understand where they were coming from. Mechanisms of how loans worked and how deep the problem came across quite starkly too. These hard facts actually make you identify with the characters who are ultimately good people that have strayed away by their circumstances.Well written characters have been performed well through and through. Kadvi Hawa is not at all a dialogue heavy film. A lot is therefore left to these performances. Tillotama Shome, ironically brings life to a woman’s submission to her situation. So effective is Sanjay Mishra’s act that after a bit, you don’t even realise that a person with sight is playing blind. Ranveer Shorey’s character is in a dire situation himself but you don’t feel like empathising with him because of the spot-on performance. Even the mute Bhupesh Singh has a presence about him for the few scenes that have him. Just by its presence in the dialogue, the wind comes across as a character in the film. Hedu might not know the science behind how the wind works but he knows the wind is what makes and breaks his life. He is in fact, nostalgic about the wind that brought him the seasons because the winds today have made his life bitter. I am not too sure if this film works as a message on climate change because it shows only the effects and stays mute on the causes. I guess those are for us to ruminate over.

Not governments, not politicians or industrialists alone, but humans as a whole. Kadvi Hawa is a bitter pill to swallow, and one that is designed to compel us to look within.

I don't know whether that puts me at an advantage/disadvantage as a viewer. There's definitely the vastness of the ravines that should lend itself better to the full canvas. But then, hey, with such performances before you on the screen--whether laptop, TV, cell-phone--does size really matter? I don't think so.
