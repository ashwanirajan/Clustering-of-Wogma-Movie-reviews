A good chick flick is just the right amount of chewing gum for the brain. Light and breezy it is good while it lasts. Cocktail lasts till a little after interval when it starts moping and mulling. A promising start meets a generic, uninteresting end.Another one of those romantic comedies, which looks fresh and entertains - in the trailer, at least. 
Three friends, whose characters are defined by the placards they hold - Meera, the typical girl who is liked by boyfriends' moms of friends; Veronica with her aversion to wearing pants; and Gautam who is most likely the man of their lives - and of course, friendship goes through troubles. A love triangle, so no guessing how many ways this can end. And either way is almost always predictable.The question then, is will they be able to engage us enough to think about who the guy will go for or at least root for one over the other. If not that, in addition to the promise of some fun, I am at least looking forward to some 'moments', especially given Imtiaz Ali is in the writing team. The fun moments look promising what with self-referencing jokes about Saif Ali Khan's youth being second-hand. But it does hurt to see the threesome take grace out of the dance. Don't they really look like they are performing a pretty awful aerobic routine? The music seems to have gained some very favorable reviews, though a couple of the songs look like promotional videos (thankfully!). It is clear with the music and the premise and the characters they have picked to represent that this one will be youthful gearing up for maturity, if not anything elseMusic Reviews:
Milliblog - "Bloody heady cocktail of a soundtrack from Pritam!"
Music Aloud - "7.5/10"
dunkdaft - "There is surely something about Saif's 'mushy' movies and Pritam - together, they both work perfect."
Bollywood Hungama - "4.5/5"
Bollyspice - "4/5"

Glamsham - "4/5"

  I love well-made romantic comedies, I am sucked in by many a romantic tragedies. But a comedy that becomes a tragedy and a fresh comedy that turns into a clichéd tragedy, it's just disappointing. True, I didn't think Cocktail would be great. In that sense it delivers as promised. But, the problem is it gives hope in the beginning and then just falters and falls in a great thump towards the end. The good thing though is that Cocktail never lets go of the emotions it has stirred - within the characters and  thus what we feel for the audience too. If only, they had let go of the generic love triangle towards the end.You are introduced to abla naari (damsel in distress) Meera (Diana Penty), self-acclaimed cheesy, flirtoholic Gautam (Saif Ali Khan) and one who could pass off as alcoholic, Veronica (Deepika Padukone). Veronica, as if to further define her character is brought in with a bang, especially compared to  the background music free introductory tracks of Meera and Gautam. The pace at which this happens is not in the regular cut-chop-done mode either. It eases you in and you like your stay with them as the chemistry brews with fun and freshness and makes them into much-needed therapists for each other. Unfortunately, as the film progresses you see that very little depth is accorded to Gautam as he soon starts coming across as a shuttlecock in a long rally. In contrast, the female protagonists seem to be holding their own with their dilemmas and yet they plummet to the regular and predictable outcome which most lady leads are destined to – wanting nothing else but to be with their man. Yep, maybe love indeed makes girls behave like girls – forlorn, beyond logic and turns the finest of them into stereotypical whiners. Yet, I enjoyed the supposed nastiness attached to Veronica much like her namesake from the Archie comics (except the protagonist here seems to be more Reggie than Archie). She carries a palpable loneliness within her and drowns it in the chaos of loud pubs. Deepika Padukone does great in carrying the various emotions without it being necessarily spoon-fed.  Even in a scene where she looks out-of-sorts while trying to seduce her man, you see what she's getting at right after. Similarly, Diana Penty, the demure desi in town puts forth her dilemma, her suppressed angst against how her life has shaped up with great warmth. But when these smart, independent women fall head-over-heels in love with an obnoxious over-the-top charmer you only wonder why two beautiful characters are being drowned in inanity. Saif Ali Khan looks at least five years older than he is made out to be. That besides he goes overboard with Gautam's cockiness. As intentional as it might have been, it doesn't make me root for Gautam and his dilemma comes across as silly and immature. It's not that women like 'these' can't fall in love with men like 'that' - it's love, anything can happen - but why I am being asked to give the writers or their characters benefit of doubt? Why can't I see it? I like both women enough that I want both of them to get what they want, but I don't see why they want what they want. Then come the many other quibbles. Not resorting to needless backstory is one thing, and a vivacious Veronica having no friends before Meera and Gautam is quite another. These are the things that distract from the believability of the story. On the other hand, the backstory offered by way of Gautam's mom (Dimple Kapadia) and uncle (Boman Irani) make you wish it wasn't offered. Their characters are mere pawns in making the story make that twist that turns it into ever-so-blah. Not to mention the two awesome actors are made to play loud, meatless characters. Similarly, Meera's husband's (Randeep Hooda) track is also avoidable thus saving a lot of precious screentime. It is all left to the threesome then to pull it through. They do manage for a bit but what can actors do once the script has fallen prey to standard terms and conditions. No experimentation, no risks, no gut.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Boy meets girl. Boy meets another girl. The three have fun together until they all fall in love. Boy meets girl. Boy meets another girl. The three have fun together until they all fall in love. 
The sequences in discos/pubs.
The disco sequence in which Veronica is depicted as lonely in the madness. Edited really well.
Deepika Padukone's performance in the drunk sequence where she feels cheated and abandoned. 
A man crying whole-heartedly on screen - always find something very human about it. 
Gautam's proposal in staggered thoughts.
Everything that was typical of romantic films. From the abandoned lover seeing their reflection in  a broken mirror to a lover going from one country to another to find their loved one.

Veronica's shoes in her introductory scene. 
oh...the trailer didn't show abt randeep hooda part..didn't know tht..why did u give that away ;-(one heady cocktail...i need my aspirin!!!The only positives-dialogues,music and deepika doing what she does best,flaunt her bod.P.S.: Meetu its meera's husband(penultimate line) not veronica's.@ab Well you see him in the film soon enough, in the first few minutes. So, it's not really a surprise-surprise.@nkit oops! o.O fixed. Thanks for pointing it out.looks like a very high rating for a stupid pointless movie like this. But what do i know about movies..@Lil :) i liked the the first half and some of the characteristics of the two lead ladies.lovely movie and superb music particularly tumhe ho bandhu..diana penty is simply adorable and saif looks cute     http://www.lenstrade.comDirection: 3.5    Story: 2.5    Lead Actors: 3.5    Character Artists: 3    Dialogues: 3.5    Screenplay: 3    Music Director: 3    Lyrics: 3Well what a regressive movie!!! A fun-loving, independent women will have to be a demure Indian "naari" even for an idiot like SAK's character. And I am surprised the film doing well and women especially liking it! When do we as audiences plan to grow up?This is the worst movie of the decade and does not deserve more than one star. It has a stupid buffoonish character who lies to get women in bed. Then he meets an independent girl and he moves in, they shack up. Enter another charming girl, this time a sati savitri in a mini. He prefers her naturally as she is the virginal type, and lo behold she too likes him too! What is sad is that an independent fearless girl like Veronica wants to now change a hundred percent into a sati savitri to please the guy. She wants to become everything he wants her to be. She says she will do anything if he will have her. It's so pathetic and sad! A real shame. I am very ashamed that this movie is successful. Is this our India?Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
