Another dark comedy that deals with the grit of the city. Fortunately, it is another well-made dark comedy. Shor in the city is well-shot and has good performances. It also has a few well-developed, interesting characters. Yet, the plot gives a very "been there, seen that" feel."Cute" is my first reaction to Shor in the city. Of course, not in the mush-mush kind-of way. It is after all, a dark comedy set deep in the grim, gritty recesses of a fractured city that we all make. But, a nag starts as soon as the main characters are introduced.

As I enjoyed how well Shor in the city is shot and admired every performance, I was trying to point my finger at what was bothering me, what was keeping this from being a complete fun experience? When I read, "Each incident is inspired by a newspaper story" in the end credits, I realized the familiarity of the stories is what was bothering me. Not that I knew of the stories before hand, but this is how this new genre of "dark comedy/pulp" is beginning to settle in Hindi cinema. 
You have your mix of rugged texture, close-ups, relatively non-standard camera angles. Even story wise, you have a regular dose of hotch-potch of 4-5 stories with interesting characters. Their paths collide. And along the way, you make comments on the system we form, the society we make. 
In the social commentary department, Shor in the city chooses bribery, a sarcastic look at religion, stronghold of underworld crime, the hierarchy that a gun-holder can create, frustration of the honest man in this big, bad world. It uses a small-time crook who gets interested in the books he pirates to define both the futility, superficiality and yet the charm of the escape that a "philosophical" world creates. Oh yeah, and it also exposes our fake love for our national passion - cricket. The candid, uninhibited smooching and making out scenes announce the new-age cinema's emphatic decision to be bold and also shows how liberal the SMS/BPO center generation is. 
Given that none of these things are new to us, the performances make this film a watchable experience. Certainly, there are smart-ass dialogues but from Tusshar Kapoor to Pitobhash to Amit Mistry - each actor makes his character just perfect. 
Yeah, it is different from your mainstream films but within its genre it's "more of the same". In fact, it's one of those films in which no climax will surprise you - be it characters who die or the ones that survive. Fortunately, you mildly care for some of the characters and interested in what happens to them.

          Shor in the City - parallel story concept, Tushar Kapoor with dialogues doing justice, predictable at the end, but enjoyable.

          Watch Shor In The City if you haven't already. Low-budget Bollywood is always better than big-budget Bollywood. You'll love this one.

          I just saw 'Shor In The City' and it was a beautiful trip. #Bollywood, preceded by 'Source Code' and it's been a filling Saturday.
        
Anirudh_Shukla:
          Shor in the city and Chalo Dilli are cool movies to see...
Haunted is not at all watchable....

samotimazumdar:
          Shor in the City is majorly flawed.
        
radhesen:
          Shor in the city.. 3 stories set in aamchi mumbai that intersect. Not too impressed by the movie but totally loved the character of manduk.
        
niksypixie:
          Disappointed with Shor in the City, much a din about nothing !
        
nalinirathnam:
          shor in the city is a tame....badly dubbed and a pointless film, way below my expectations. liked paritosh n sendhil though......
        
dhanu_hansda:
          I hate Balaji's (Ekta Kapoor) TV Serials,bt I lk its Movies.Their Shor in the City (Movie) disappointed me:(
        
complicateur:
          And the review of Shor in the City: http://complicateur.blogspot.com/2011/05/sounds-of-street.html . Despite all the good press, the film has its issues.
        
adityaanupkumar:
          Shor in the City shows the utter dereliction of the "new wave" of Hindi Cinema. They're all exactly the same one unimaginative movie.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.3 friends who are small-time crooks. A struggling cricketer. An NRI trying to find his feet in India.3 friends who are small-time crooks. A struggling cricketer. An NRI trying to find his feet in India.
The line in the opening credits, something along the lines - the city is an excuse for people to be bad.
The background score and the sound.
it seems the movie has something to state(social messages) as you have wrote the review above.i will check it of course ,i just want to watch tushar speaking.@guddu let us know what you think.@noopur ha ha. we all have our own biases. :P cheers to "to each his own" i say!I am wondering why you did not rate the music / soundtrack of the film. I found it to be amazing and one of the strong points of the film. For me, it was the soundtrack along with all the things that you noted (characters, acting) that made it memorable to watch in a theatre. Even at home, I keep hearing the music again and again, along with Yeh Saali Zindagi's. Saaibo is an excellent composition! The movie also reminded me of Babel.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
