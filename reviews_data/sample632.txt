
wogma rating: Watch if you have nothing better to do (?)
While Jannat 2's lead character, Sony Dilli has a decent conflict, the film isn't worth watching because of the dull manner it is narrated in. In many ways, Jannat 2 feels like a film that could've been a film worth watching once if it had a little better of everything, especially better actors to play the side characters and the villain.What is it that makes Vishesh Films name its films to make them sound like sequels? Murder 2 earlier and now Jannat 2 have nothing to do with the films with the same names but for the number attached at the end. Is it that the producers are trying to bank on the success of the earlier films to get in the initial crowd? Is it lack of creativity? Is it pure laziness? Or is it mere disinterest? The same disinterest that shows through the film by the actors and the director.

Of the entire team, only the writer seems to show interest right through the end of his assignment. Sonu Dilli (Emraan Hashmi), a small-time gun-dealer finds himself stuck between a cop (Randeep Hooda) who forces Sonu to turn into an informer; his willingness to live an honest living for the love of his life (Esha Gupta); and the bigger-time dons of the underworld (Manish Choudhary). A dilemma that could've been so much more engaging but for some awful performances and a tedious screenplay. 
Similarly, the dialogues are some of the most inane ones. The kind that actors should have objection to saying out loud, however inept they might be at their work. No, I'm not referring to perfunctorily used profanity Except for Emraan Hashmi, the rest of the cast is rather monotonous, each one seems to take to one expression and hold to it. This fact is more so evident in the cases of Randeep Hooda, Esha Gupta and Manish Choudhary. Anyway, as usual, the lead lady is made irrelevant in a crime saga. 
Despite all of this, I'd consider the climax one of the bravest ones in recent times. It is surprisingly unexpected for an otherwise predictable story. It is also an interesting one in terms of what it means to the various characters, even if they aren't written with too much depth. Yet, it can't take away from the fact that it is 'too little, and a little too late'. 
Jannat 2 is another one of those standard crime romances to come out of the Bhatt stable -  only less engaging than the average Vishesh Films' product.

          Jannat 2 was fine. Ok to watch one time. But beware it is full of gaalis. :D
        
singhcd:
          Jannat 2 - (cont.) I constantly got 'been there done that' feeling and hence felt little cheated. But not a bad film by BHATT standards.
        
Sameer1155:
          JANNAT 2 is good, but not as gr8 as expected....

BabaUmarr:
          Actors go full Maa-behen in #Jannat 2. Muslims shown baddies.Movie is average bt Randeep Hooda rocks till the end of this 'one time watch' .
        
ahmednkhan:
          Jannat 2 is another genre of movie- lots of abuses but content neat. Hooda-Imran nice bonding !!! Can Watch !!! Kunal Deshmugh good job.
        
_Hi_Bye_:
          So much of bhencho macho in Jannat 2. The script is weak.
        
vyoma08:
          hey bhagwan yeh movie jannat 2 kyun banai gai! Total misuse of imran hashmi..but really randeep hooda stole the show..

          Jannat 2 - I was stuck so choose to spend some time in Cinema but it was awful. I wish I could have watched Vikky... http://fb.me/1ErjMmlsz

Sum_IH:
          Ending of Jannat-2 is on similar lines as its first part but still Jannat-1 was far better. It's ending much dramatic & unique.
        
Srkoholic:
          Jannat 2 is def not a sequel..its no where near the original...jus an another boring muv...only thing good abt it was d music n BG score!!
        
sramugade:
          Just saw jannat now on tv and now am sure jannat2 was hardly 20 per cent as good to the former, jannat 2 failed to evoke the same emotion
        
sensonize:
          Jannat 2 Review: Nothing like 'JANNAT' in it. The original Jannat was way better than this. Can give it a miss.

Parental Guidance:


Rated Adult.
Violence: Loads of gun fights. Well, the lead character is a gun-dealer.
Language: Loads and loads of profanity.

Concept: A gun-dealer who has decided to mend his ways gets caught in a trap that doesn't let him do so.
General Look and Feel: Dark.
