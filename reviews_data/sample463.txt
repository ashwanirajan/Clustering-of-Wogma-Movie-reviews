
wogma rating: Add to 'must watch' list (?)
Much fun and gore - a combination I never thought would've worked. But owing to some witty dialogue and  perfectly timed dialogue delivery make Go Goa Gonea watch well worth it. Go Goa Gone - they lost me at the title. A little curiosity came about when I realised that it is a zombie film. But, that was instantly killed with this trailer. They ruined it completely when they answered the first question that popped in my head, "What are zombies doing in Goa?" with a quite literal and lame, "Globalization!"I'm not a huge fan of zombie films. It has never stopped amazing me that there are enough films to make this into a genre. What an excuse to display gore through the entire length of the film? That and there's so little in terms of story in a zombie film. Fortunately, Go Goa Gone's tells you right at the trailer that it doesn't want to be taken seriously. And all the elements that you see so far, point towards a feeble attempt at spoof. Despite all my misgivings, I still have hope from the director duo because of their earlier films 99 and Shor in the City. I completely enjoyed their dark humor. However, Saif Ali Khan going about killing dead people while pretending to be Russian is hardly inspiring.Interestingly enough, the music has garnered decent reviews. Let's hope the film gets good laughs out of us. Music Reviews:
Bollyspice - "4/5"
dunkdaft - "insane bloody mad soundtrack, thanks to the composer duo Sachin-Jigar and the lyricists."
Milliblog - "Whimsical, fun soundtrack!"
Music Aloud - "8/10"

  The most annoying bit about zombie films is that the story just doesn't move, only the zombies do. It starts with people becoming zombies, one inexplicable way or the other. It goes on with deadpan, gory zombies staggering around beautiful scenery. Living people fight dead people in an hour+ long chase sequence. And people beat the zombies in the last 15-20 minutes. That and you have people eating people. Go Goa Goneis more or less the same, except that it has a lot of fun along the way and is headed towards a definite purpose. Go Goa Gonestarts off with the usual toilet and sexual humor you'd find in a film involving three bachelors living together, down to the oft-repeated Hardik joke. But, it has its unique style which keeps you interested. And of course, you are waiting for the zombies to appear. Meanwhile, beyond the commonplace humor are one-liners that make you  laugh out loud. With context, even the 'globalization' dialogue, that put me off in the trailers, works. The dialogue is witty and yet, not filmy. It is the kind of language friends would speak with each other. The delivery of course, is perfectly timed, else the lines would have fallen flat. Kunal Khemu, Vir Das and Anand Tiwari carry out the buffoonery well. Puja Gupta's Luna exists just so the film doesn't become too 'man'ly. But she does well nevertheless. Saif Ali Khan has his usual screen presence, but isn't required to do much really. In fact, this film is not about the characters at all. The main leads start out as the typical good, bad and in-between trio. The distinguishing lines soon merge into all three of them being afraid while keeping their humor intact. Yet, except for a couple of times, it doesn't seem out of place. I'd think zombie films would be categorized as horror films, but Go Goa Gonedoesn't fall in the horror category. Sure, it has more than its share of gore and intestine like things being pulled out of necks but it still doesn't qualify as horror. Also, the background score is quite different from the kind we associate with horror films or even thrillers. In fact, Go Goa Gonegoes beyond these genres to even comment about things like group dynamics in terms of who become a leader and how a group goes astray without a leader. You have an additional layer of a 'social message' stuck on to it. While, I'm not too much in favor of adding meaning to a film by merely slapping on a message at the end, I'm glad Go Goa Gonehad one. At least there is more to a zombie film than people walking around like zombies. Also, the manner in which the message unfolds makes it pallatable, except for the last revision of lessons and "moral of the story" dialogue between the characters. Similarly, there are a couple of instances in which the people behave dumber than the zombies. Clearly, the situations have been added just to bring in some variety in an otherwise flat plot. But, they are all done in good humor and hence pass by. What makes Go Goa Gonea film worth the watch is certainly the fine manner in which comedy and horror/thriller have been combined. Who would have thought a day would come when I'd say, I'm looking forward to the sequel of a zombie film!

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Zombies in Goa. You should be gone, only you are not in mainland Goa, you are on an island.Zombies in Goa. You should be gone, only you are not in mainland Goa, you are on an island.
A shot in a dark room where only a lit cigarette can be seen.
Red caricature intersperses. 
Stop action Monday blues song.
"Thank you very much" that sounded like "F*** you very much"
lime being flushed down the toiled along with the alcohol.

The "No Smoking" appeal by Saif Ali Khan. Started out well, but then he started hamming. Like Saif Ali Khan calling it "dangerous" and "terrible" will make it any more or less horrifying. 
Abbreviation and Facebook talk - FYI, BTW and so on. - Lame attempt at trying to make film sound cool.
Thrill of smoking in a 'no smoking' area was a good concept but somehow was killed by Kunal Khemu.
Scene outside Hardik's (Kunal Khemu) office window.
Restaurant scene with Luv's (Vir Das) girlfriend.
Luna (Puja Gupta) has fresh lipstick on all the time!
Scene in which Kunal Khemu cries! How out of place was that!
The mother of all questions - how do zombies differentiate between zombies and people?
Why were the characters repeatedly walking into a group of zombies?
Why did Bunny (Anand Tiwari) not come down the tower instead of Hardik going up?

Continuity jerk Kunal Khemu is wearing a ring in one scene, not in the next and again wearing it in the one after that.
Where did the group get change of clothes from!?
This seems like a fun flick. I quite like the music from what I've heard so far, that song khoon choos le is awesome!I just hope it dosen't turn out to be too slapsticky & lame...Meetu, though you have already mentioned you are not fan of zombie movies, I still have to ask - what is your opinion about - 'Shaun of the Dead' (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0365748/)?zombies in Indian movie for the first time, delhi se hun............ never seen any bollywood trailor going so viral... waiting eagerly@Manik I'm 50-50 about the humor.@Swapnil haven't watched that one.@Rajat really? Is the trailor gone that viral?I think you are being too quick to judge. After shor in the city (and 99) - I'd watch a porno flick if they made it. We are too quick to put down our own cinema. (That's not totally unjustified, but you are not exactly talking about Sajid Khan or David Dhawan here!)Hear this interview - I think they're being as serious about this film as about SITC. Even if the subject is funny! http://youtu.be/9ylA-1aJAjgAnd in other interviews they have said that they are not selling gore (unlike you opined earlier) which is why they picked a zomcom to film rather than a zombie horror film! Don't you forget that Danny Boyle also made a zombie film!@Santosh I will listen to the interviews you mentioned. Also actually, I'm judging the promo material and describing how they make me feel. Having said that, points taken - especially the one about these directors vs. Sajid Khan/David Dhawan :D@meetu yes it did. i remember it crossing a million views on youtube in two daysa good start for a zombie movie in india,,,nice comedy,,,,,screenplay go flat in some places,,,,it happens when u doesnt have much in the story,,,,but the movie has been presented well,,,,waiting for the sequal....And yes ,, a perfect review too by meetuSaif was excellent, the jokes and humor were funny too , all three of them played there part convincingly but the plot could have been much better, it wasn't waste of money . Meetu i agree with your review as always but shouldn't be the first Indian Zombie movie be judged ignoring the basic parameters of merits:P .@Rajat wow!@Anup Thank you. Finally, eh?@Guddu sorry didn't get this - "shouldn't be the first Indian Zombie movie be judged ignoring the basic parameters of merits:P ."I think the movie is loosy based on "Shaun of the Dead" and "Zoombieland". These are also zoombie movies but can't be categorized as horror flicks.So much better than the same old love triangle shit.Really, Meetu? You loved this one? Wow - we passed it up going "Oh, not another Zombie comedy!" and watched Agent Vinod instead. I think we got it backwards....he he he...maybe guilty pleasure of some sort. Also, I don't find too many things funny, so when I laugh, I really love it!I guess we really have to now, Meetu - if you liked it, and it's not the normal kind of thing you like, at all.... :DFurther to my last comment - everybody's up for watching this on Halloween in about three-four weeks! :)Hey, we watched it tonight - and OMG, was that the most pleasant Halloween surprise we've had from India since... ever! Even the two women who normally hate violent movies and foul-mouthed comedy were laughing uproariously, and having a grand old time with it!You were completely right, Meetu - for once, Saif Ali Khan's love for Western Film Genres and comic book movies was a perfect fit for one of his films. We loved Loved LOVED it, and would love to see the further adventures of Boris and his Cracked Squad of Hero Clowns. Even Puja Gupta's Luna fit into the dynamic as far more than The Girl as Prize - she was (most of the time) smarter than any of the guys other than Boris or Dimitri, though she still made her share of "Stupid as the Zombies" mistakes herself. Best part was that every time somebody behaved stupidly, it was just like these people would behave stupidly because they've never been in this far over their heads before! Goa Goa Gone clearly owes a debt to Shaun of the Dead, but I think it's a far better comedy and zombie movie. A whole Room Full of American Enthusiastic Thumbs Ups!ha ha ha ha!
