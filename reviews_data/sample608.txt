Tees Maar Khan makes me admire Farah Khan (Director) and Shirish Kunder (writer) for how they choose  not to take anything seriously, themselves first. But, they are sniggering amongst themselves. It's one thing to laugh at anything and everything from - the umbilical cord to patriotism - and it's a whole other thing  NOT TO make us laugh with them. So obnoxious is the film along with its stars Akshay Kumar and Katrina Kaif  that the subtle points that Tees Maar Khan seems to make, come across as completely accidental.Bond-ish title music, Inspector Gadget-ish look - 

Farah Khan is known for the Bollywood references in her films, seems to be going international in her tributes. 
Supposedly, the entire film can be looked upon as inspired by After the Fox, but of course Farah Khan denies it and says it's based on Amar Chitra Katha comics. Uhhhh...How can a film be based on Amar Chitra Katha?! The comics are themselves based on stories from mythology and folklore!! 
I looked up the 30-second trailers here and was completely disheartened by the one-liners. If this is supposed to pull us into the theaters, I dread the deadpan lines that are waiting to greet me in the feature. An Akshay Kumar film, by definition has to be loud. But, to not even expect good punch-lines makes me want to weep. 
But why cry dear, when Sheila is here. Who needs to laugh when all they want you to do is drool, right? Yes, the song has grown on me. But I guess my 'like' doesn't count because I like to hear it more than watch it. But for those of you who are smitten by Sheila's jawani, here goes -

  As hard as it is to believe, Tees Maar Khan subtly remarks about the state of the country. National treasure being passed on from the administrative authorities to thugs. What else is it, if it is not a commentary, when the same thugs make a mockery of the law and order system - standing smack in the middle of a courtroom? All this by a "con artist" pulling off a heist almost as if he has the blessings of the police. Trying to make sense out of the non-stop chaos that the rest of the film is, these subtleties may seem like accidents. But, you have to give this one to them. Using a village full of village fools as representatives, the filmmakers are certainly pointing a big fat finger at us, the audience who laps up this stuff in the name of masala.

I didn't grow up watching Keislowski and Fellini. Far from it. I was brought up to love masala-makers turned filmmakers.  I laughed and cried with the actors and the characters they played. Then too, it was a world ruled by stars. But now I laugh with contempt and weep at only one person - me. A part of the audience. 
How and when did definition of masala entertainment change from a coherent story to a broadly set-up plot strung together with the most plainly written sub-sequences? When did strong romantic undercurrent transform into Sheila romancing her own jawaani or the hero overtly and superficially caring about her modesty? The only thing that seems to have come through the decades is the random breaking into song and dance. Oh well, Jai Ho? 
I agree Katrina Kaif played the annoying bimbo to perfection, but then, was it acting at all? I don't mean this as an insult, I just question her choice of a role. I cannot even bring myself to comment on Akshay Kumar's loud utterances of words that seem to be getting at a sentence. Because most of the time, he's either saying "ta...f ki izzat ..something..tees maar khan...something..." or is just narrating what's going to happen in the story in the next 20 minutes. 
Incidentally the word "tawaif" (haaaw, I said it!) is beeped out as per censor requirements. And I think Farah Khan has the last laugh on this one because what we end up hearing is "beeeep..f..ki izzat..." That one cracked me up. And a couple of other jokes. 
I know you are supposed to laugh at the silliness. But I demand that the silliness be funny not lame. I'd like to respect the woman (Farah) for making a film, it's a difficult process, I admit. But, I'd like a little respect in return, for my sense and sensibility.

kahankakhan:
          best film:My Name is Khan! Had a message and soul yet enjoyable:) worst film:Tees Maar Khan...
        
jimmykadakia:
          Tees Maar Khan probably the worst movie of the year, not sure which is worst #TMK or Drona. Though #Sheila Ki Jawani sizzles!
        
jhabarun:
          Tawayaf ki lut ti izzat bachana or Tees Maar Khan me sense dhundhna....dono bekaar hai
        
jerffinerff:
          Tees Maar Khan was a silly sort of timepass. Didn't live up to Main Hoon Na or Om Shanti Om. :/ Liked two songs aight.
        
I_Sharat:
          By the way, Khan o main Khan Tees Maar Khan is a stupid movie. The only thing I liked about the movie is nothing. Oh wait, Shiela ki Jawani
        
impratikshukla:
          'Tees Maar Khan' is an apt title for such a film. It means 'after you watch this, slap yourself 30 times to come back to your senses'
        
iampradipta:
          ''Tees Mar Khan is a bogus film, don't watch it''

filmytown:
          Tees Maar Khan - Disappoints. First 20 minutes its paisa vasool & includes the Sheela ki jawani song. Later on its loud, dramatic n drags.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Inspired by: After the foxDirector: Farah KhanCast: Akshay Kumar, Katrina Kaif, Akshaye Khanna and Salman KhanRating: Two and a half ( **1/2)Advice: Akshaye Khanna saves the film from being banal and keeps you tickled through the film. Watch it for him and some good naach gaana.@haulerz99 my sympathies. next time you know where to check before booking your tickets :D@Sudhir a thousand apologies sir. i did say sorry to them and my readers (holding ears and all), unfortunately it stayed in my head. In the rush to catch the next two films, got left out from the review. will take mucho care next time :P@Narayan please to check this review against http://wogma.com/movie/om-shanti-om-review/Nothing. It make me more upset even thinking about it as most of the actors are my favourite and they have done the worst acting in whole there carrer just for the sake of money.The role, the story, the direction, the actors not with enough importance, the music except two song mentioned above, the cinemetography, the camera angle, the dialouges except few of akshay kumars one. Non of the dialouges make sense as akshay is not even shown dashing once to say that kind of dialouges. I didnt like the way farah khan thought about the audiance coz film is made for our entertainment and not for our mental torture. we can clearly see her intenstion behind this movie. She made a low budget film coming on x-mas to make good chunk of profit and increase her bank balance.I think you are too kind on this movie. Very silly movie. Reminds me of Wayans Bros. movies. They make those for mentally challenged people :)@Tees maar Khan ha ha ha ha.@kaka hopefully our uproar will change things.@Lucky and @Aditi you've seen the 'sheila ki jawani' video, you've seen the film :)good movie worth watching.. stop piracyMovie was not bad. Watched movie like paisa wasoolIt was a nice movie.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
