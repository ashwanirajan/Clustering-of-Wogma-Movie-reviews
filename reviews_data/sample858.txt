It's different, it's sincere, it's inconclusive, it's abstract in its own way. It's intriguing and it leaves you dissatisfied. It has brilliant performances along with some bits of Aamir Khan being Aamir Khan. It is a mellow affair that's soothing yet unnerving.The tagline/alternate name 'Mumbai Diaries' along with what you see in the promos scream - a film set in the city of dreams, which is also the big, bad city. One more film named after another popular location in Mumbai, Bhindi Bazaar - Bhindi Bazaar Inc. is going to be added to this already over-crowded space of Mumbai's underbelly. 
Mumbai is cruel yet she can be warm. We know this. Does Kiran Rao & co. have anything new to say, or do they say it in a different way at least? The first promo offers hope. The promos structure itself is intriguing. And the music sticks. 


Note how there is absolutely nothing new about the way Mumbai is shot or presented. Nor does it promise to be a 'different' story. It actually clearly indicates that it just might be a boy-meets-girl-meets-boy-meets-girl story. And yet, there is something very engaging about the way it is done. And the hope is that the film will do the same. 
The promo was loved by many and did its rounds on Facebook and twitter. And like with any other Aamir Khan product, the expectations are extremely high. With him we have come to expect a sophisticated film. And with every word that he says to belittle our intelligence his own words those expectations only go higher. 
You see a glimpse of the smugness in the following video. Only to be completely taken over by how they found one of their main leads. 


That's the thing about a film Aamir Khan is associated with, it has that something extra to look forward to despite the 'smarter-than-thou' way in which it is dealt out. 
And here's the biggest surprise of them all. In the day and age where Hindi movies are known to rake in the moolah with sale of music albums, Dhobi Ghat doesn't have a music album at all! Now that's being 'different' even by Aamir standards!

  Love is elusive. Whatever the heart is after is seldom within reach. In fact, more often than we'd like, even what we 'really' want escapes us. This is the broad stroke Kiran Rao paints with Dhobi Ghat. She does so very quietly, hand-in-hand with her mild, four subdued characters. It actually feels like she's reading their diaries out to us. She passes judgment on the society we form - the young and the old, the rich and the poor, the "educated" and the illiterate, the secularists and the socialists. But she is almost mute as she goes about it. And none of this gets boring BUT the spark is conspicuous by its absence. Like leftover champagne from yesterday - not yet flat but not as relish-worthy as when the cork first popped.

The setting could have been New York, Sydney, or even Pune. Any reasonable-size town is likely to have a slum dweller with larger-than-life aspirations, an NRI poking around the slums, an artist with an attitude, and an unsuspecting immigrant who is trying to figure the city out. Kiran Rao chose Mumbai and I'm not complaining. Mumbai does have her way of providing warmth with ruggedness, and that is the exact texture Dhobi Ghat gives the maya-nagri. 
Besides, I love the city and I romanticize my visits there just like Yasmin (Kriti Malhotra) does with her home videos. Her awe is as evident as her discomfort. Her resolve to find amusement in her boring life is ironic considering the hustle around her. It ain't new but the contrast hasn't come through in a movie earlier. Isn't it amazing that in a city where even stray dogs seem to be in a rush, housewives (other than Yasmin too) entertain themselves with TV in the middle of the day? 
You observe Yasmin along with Arun (Aamir Khan). Her simple story is absorbing. And it's very intriguing that Yasmin aroused more emotion and attachment than the more complex Arun. Maybe that's how it was meant to be, because Arun is supposed to evoke indifference. But such characters who don't make me feel anything for them leave me dissatisfied with the movie experience. Arun might just be the weakest character of the four. After all he's the only one who gets relatively melodramatic in this subtle environment, albeit only towards the end. 
And yet not everyone is me. Arun does manage to capture Shai's (Monika Dogra)imagination. A large part of Shai represents the stereotype of the returned-non-resident Indian who is on a poverty tour. But her emotions for Arun make you feel for her and reach out to her. 
And in turn you also want good things to happen to Munna (Prateik). You know his desires are beyond his reach, but you smile at his immaturity and want him to learn from his mistakes. I loved the person he grows to become. 
Like them or not, each character has been written in detail and has an arc of their own. And that is what keeps the viewer going in this otherwise dull ambience. There are some brilliant, mostly-earthy performances; except for Aamir Khan who pretty much stays the star he is. There's also the slight touch of humor. But, it slides into documentary mode every once in a while. There are certainly no conclusions, no strong messages, nothing that can be called 'entertaining'. The intention is to leave the audience high and dry.
Yet the seasoned festival delegate will find Dhobi Ghat like every other 'decent' film he sees. And the masala-seeker might just curse the money he spent on the Aamir Khan brand. It is for the in-betweens that the film will work for best. 
And this takes nothing away from debutant director Kiran Rao. I like her casting. The charming faces are the aces in her sleeve. I like the milieu she has created, especially the home video parts. I like her taste in background music and her decisions on when to use it and not. And yet I can't point a finger at why this was a fine but not a wholesome experience. Maybe because I'm made to see how lonely each one of us is, no matter what our background is...

Ravinder_Dagar:
          Beautifully shot and evocative background score, 'Dhobi Ghat' is occasionally indulgent and moves at a glacial pace. Worth watch !!!
        
randomwalkers:
          just saw Dhobi Ghat - so raw, so intense yet subdued, so touching. the background score, in parts, was that of a morgue.

Agrawal_ani:
          Loved "Dhobi Ghat", which examined concepts of class, migration and voyeurism, an antidote to the western gaze of slumdog millionaire.
        
agentjay2009:
          When a movie conveys the story via silence and expressions, it has to be applauded. #dhobi ghat

_ShallWe:
          Dhobi Ghat is a middling debut, watchable due to its nuances but not interesting enough to recommend.wd hv worked if it was a 40 min flick
        
ZarinaKhan27:
          Its been a cold weekend, my friends and I watched Dhobi Ghat today. Expected more from the movie but acting was good.

sunilgivesup:
          Dhobi Ghat-slow but sensitive,beautifully shot n acted.Moments linger,but not memorable.Big letdown-Aamir: underplaying an underwritten role
        
santuwebstr:
          Dhobi Ghaat ( 2011 ) : Decent Movie.. Not Super duper great.. bt not yawning too :).. slow flow of movie was a gud move

meghnd:
          Dhobi Ghat will not do well in India. For one thing, it has no particular story. It's just a really interesting ART film.
        
jhilmilmotihar:
          Dhobi Ghat was interesting but terribly indulgent.
        
JDnJOY:
          rather than showing excess intellectuality, 'Dhobi ghat' cud be little better movie.
        
hope_tree2010:
          Last night I watched Kiran Rao's new movie "DHOBI GHAT". Kiran's debut appears to be serious attempt to make something different. That's all
        
chewmysambhar:
          Dhobi Ghat is an arthouse attempt.Boring in parts, a lil confused script ,superb BG score and beautiful beautiful shades.

          Dhobi Ghat...over-hyped but a good watch nonetheless. Worth it only coz of Prateik Babbar!

Suvayan:
          Dhobi Ghaat - Nothing but documentary, that too highly boring. Kiran Rao - Just another case of lucky spouse with a powerful better half.

: VERY SLOW AND BORING
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.A story that connects a slum dweller with larger-than-life aspirations (Munna - Prateik), an NRI poking around the slums (Shai - Monica Dogra), an artist with an attitude (Arun - Aamir Khan), and an unsuspecting immigrant who is trying to figure the city out (Yasmeen - Kriti Malhotra).A story that connects a slum dweller with larger-than-life aspirations (Munna - Prateik), an NRI poking around the slums (Shai - Monica Dogra), an artist with an attitude (Arun - Aamir Khan), and an unsuspecting immigrant who is trying to figure the city out (Yasmeen - Kriti Malhotra).
Aamir Khan's character Arun, like him in real life, doesn't like public appearances. :)
The tribute paid to people from all over India who made Mumbai
The first exchange between Shai and Munna
The comment on our education system that just has her learn by rote rather than understand what we read. 
Yasmeen's last scene - it was almost as if she were speaking and apologizing to Arun
Prateik's last action. That one little thing said so many things!

Prateik's desparate attempt to droop his shoulders to show Munna's submissive nature.
An NRI sees the world in B&W; - was there an attempt to say that?
