Strong characters with even stronger performances let down by an awfully ‘meh’ climax. And such a bummer that most of the ‘fun’ moments made it to the trailer. You can expect everything but the normal from Vidya Balan and I love every bit of it. Just the trailer exposes you to this vivacious, warm, quirky woman Sulu. This ambitious housewife seems to have simple dreams and a dollop of confidence. A confidence that could make her the butt of jokes from people around her but ends up converting them into her fans. It is interesting that you can make so much out about the characters from the trailer but not much about the story and its conflict. The makers seem so confident of their characters to draw you in! Can’t wait to know Sulu better! Tumhari Sulu releases on 17 November, 2017.

  Sulu is not a character you see too often in films. You can see the great deal of thought that has gone into writing the character. That is true for the other characters too. Unfortunately, the story meanders to the point of taking the entire film down with it, and along the way you have repetitive character traits and situations. So, Sulu (Vidya Balan) is chirpy and we see a lot of those in Hindi films. In fact, the other radio jockey in the film, Albeli Anjali (Malishka Mendonsa) who is the regular brand of chirpy we see in Hindi films shows you how different Sulu’s chirp is. Sulu differentiates herself because of the milieu she belongs to – the simplicity of a middle-class family. She makes tea for her family and wrings clothes out of her washing machine with the same spirit as she performs as a radio jockey. Her vigor and humor is indefatigable. She is so comfortable with her personality and sees perfect sense in the most impractical ideas she wants to follow through on. And yet she is more comfortable when she is by herself in the quiet of her day – you see the same content when she talks into the mic and has become oblivious to the people around her. For a person with a relatively conservative background, she is extremely non-judgmental. She thinks it is perfectly fine for her to take calls from horny men at a late night radio show, as a jockey. In fact, her charm and grounded attitude towards callers converts people who laugh at her to people who laugh with her. Sulu is no feminist. She is not struggling any more because she is a woman. Being a wife and mother to her son is a part of her being. Her relatively more-accomplished sisters (Sindhu Shekharan and Seema Taneja) are working women who put her down with their dad in an almost Cinderella-esque manner. They ask Sulu’s husband, Ashok (Manav Kaul), who is prince charming of his own kind, to talk sense into her. But, it still have nothing to do with feminism. Collectively, they are not upset because Sulu has taken up a job being a woman. They are not happy with the kind of job she is doing. Ashok begins to get bitter not because she is working but because she is talking to horny men in her sexiest voice. He is romantically jealous, not necessarily professionally so. And yet, the feminism comes through in the subtlest of forms when a passer-by woman police officer is dropping her child to school while asking him to make sure he eats well. Many characters who are not usually women are being performed by women in Tumhari Sulu - from the night-shift cab-driver (Trupti Khamkar) to the radio station’s head (Neha Dhupia) to the police officers on night duty and even the sisters who mentally harass Sulu – any of these roles could have been assigned to men and we wouldn’t bat an eye. But, women in these roles, made the film more feminist than it would have been if Sulu had to fight for her right to do the job she likes against a dominating husband or father. Objectification too is highlighted in an indirect way. At one end you have Sulu who is taking calls from men, who would most likely be calling because Sulu’s sultry voice makes them horny. At the other end you have Ashok who seems to be living a typical married life with a weekly/monthly limit on sex.  And at yet another end, you have their pre-teen son, Pranav (Abhishek Sharrma) who rents out adult magazines and CDs to his classmates. Tumhari Sulu doesn’t bother with making a value judgment of any of these, it just puts it out there. Note how you know so much about the side-characters. It is a shame then, that despite the warmth with which each character is written – even Ashok’s irate boss or the writer for Sulu’s radio programme (Vijay Maurya) – the story comes across as forced and relatively lame with of course, one of the weirdest resolutions in films. It is almost like the three broad departments of writing – story, characters and dialogue are different skill sets. It has always surprised me how realistically written and executed ambiance makes even the most ridiculous stories believable. The middle-class setting of a suburb on the outskirts of North Mumbai – with tiny houses which have living rooms that double up as dining rooms, that house families who consider Rs. 40,000 per month as a well-paying job – make you want to believe the ridiculous, fairy-tale like chance that Sulu gets to become a radio jockey. This is despite the low-income texture being forced down on you with close-ups of clothespins and cluttered sills. In fact, there were times when I thought the audience was being made to look down up on this setting with amusement as if the makers were writing an essay on – “the other life in urban suburbia: look at them, this is how they live” - middle-class porn of sorts.The songs that interrupt the story seem forced too. Except for one song, the rest come across as avoidable fillers. At its heart then, are the performances by one and all. Since, most of what you enjoy in Tumhari Sulu is the characters, it wouldn’t have worked out if it weren’t for able performances across the board. There is no way to know, relate and connect with the characters, to the point of being in tears in an otherwise comedy film, without the actors taking on their characters as their selves. Yes, I realise having one piddly paragraph for the actors when they have all done so well is not fair. But, words and more words praising each remarkable performance isn’t good enough either. The only way to do justice to performances of this caliber is to watch the film – if you can watch a film only for its characters and the performances, that is.

            Yay! Thumbs Up,
            by Fan
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.The name Vidhya Balan associated to a project always gives rise to a real sense of anticipation.Despite the fact that it has been 4 or 5 years since the last real superhit film delivered by Vidhya Balan.  Despite the fact that due to the last 4 or 5 years of one flop after another she now probably has more flops than hits to her credit.  Despite all this, every new project that Vidhya endorses gives you that feeling that this one will be an enjoyable film.  That is the magic of Vidhya Balan.And so I await this film.  Of course, given the string of recent flops my expectations are bit tempered - but that should work out in the favour of the film.Hoping to catch it in the theatre this weekend.  However, if Meeta's review is not very positive then the plans might change ;-)@Fan There you go! :D@Fan, I think Vidya Balan has more flops than hits because she takes more risks as an actress, and doesn't protect herself as an actress the way Tom Cruise in the US does, say. She's a lot like a young Jane Fonda that way, completely able to become a character and do whatever it takes, no matter how it makes her look - in THE DIRTY PICTURE, Balan played Silk as somebody who loved sex, loved attention, and would lash out if anybody got in the way of either without worrying she might come off as "unsympathetic". For an audience that wants mostly to be entertained, that kind of acting courage is "Too Much" for them - they'd rather have Salman Khan playing an overaged scamp, trying to crawl into their laps and make them love him no matter how awful he is. Sorry I mentioned American actors rather than Indian ones above - I honestly couldn't think of any one in Indian Cinema that I know who is so swaddled in "Star"-ness that  she/he is always protecting her/his image.@TimELiebe: I agree with your opinion i.e.Vidya Balan has more flops than hits because she takes more risks as an actress,And I would also like to add that she is willing to take more risks as she is confident of herself, which reduces her insecurity.  Very few Indian actresses fall in that category, I could off hand only think of Tabu from the current crop to be of the same league as Vidhya Balan.Hello!Do you want to watch a light hearted, fun filled, enjoyable film​?  Tumhari Sulu is waiting.Nice simple film, based on the struggling lives of a lower middle class Mumbai family (if Virar can be referred to as Mumbai).  Your typical difficulties to make ends meet in between an upwardly mobile society with the constant money splashing temptations, social and family pressures, work doldrums, dreams of being an overnight success in a new enterprise, and amongst all this the life moving on.At times I found the film over melodramatic, and situations too exaggerated, but all in acceptable proportions.Vidhya Balan is the star of the film. She makes Sulochana Ashok Dubey so much identifiable as your next door Sulubhabhi.  She is so very realistic that as audience you connect fully with each celebration of a joyful event, and you feel her tears at each stumble in life.  She plays to perfection a simple, spontaneous, ever optimist, innocent, charming mother housewife sister daughter neighbour.  She is endearing.Neha Dhupia did a superb job too.  As your typical 2017 professional woman entirely focussed on career (and thanks to the director for not straying into portraying other facets), she puts in a commendable performance.Manav Kaul is very believable too.This is a nice light film.  Simple characters, simple story line, simple execution.  As if Basu Chatterjee donned the director's hat once again.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
