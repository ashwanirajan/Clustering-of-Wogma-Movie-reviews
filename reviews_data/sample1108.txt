Punjabi is queenn. Wit is Jack. Plot & logic are thrown out of the deck. So, the viewers are ace jokers! But, who am I to stop Akshay-Katrina fans from rushing to the theaters?NOT A REVIEW - Just wondering how many 'n's maketh a king?I don't remember the last time I've been so bothered by the title of a movie. I think it must have been Honeymoon Travels Pvt. Ltd.. Singh is Kinng got the wrong side of my nerve endings from the word go -So, turns out the only problem I don't have with the title is the word 'is'. Oh well...To top it off, I didn't like the title song that radio jockeys seem to be in love with. And all these fears are confirmed by a glance through the 'crew' section of the official site. About the writer/director -
Some say Anees Bazmee is learning English through the titles of his films. After his last two hits, No Entry and Welcome, he's finally completed a sentence with Singh is Kinng!And how?!About the producer. Vipul Amrutlal Shah -
...he discovered through box office collections that Punjab exists in India but as well as other parts of the world! Singh is Kinng is ... his tribute to a community that lives life king-size.Oh! It's this understanding of the community that makes all Punjabi loud and garish. See kings have to be over-the-top to rule. Come on, I know a few Punjabis who are subtle and sober. Would it be so wrong to see their stories on screen? Hmmm...Turns out that fellow blogger, Honhar Goonda shares my skepticism -

...So he (Anees Bazmi) has a knack of producing hilarious scenes but can he make a film with 90% of quality scenes?......And he (Akshay Kumar) is playing a Sardar in this film. So the film is already a hit in UK......But Katrina Kaif will be looking gorgeous in that Black Sari and Pink skirt. She won’t have much to say in the film. She is just there to look gorgeous and dance. The film should have been titled as ‘Kaur Is Prinncess!'...
Oh well...what's in a name? Also, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie with a fairly obnoxious name...so looking forward to be surprised...

The graphically generated hen looked pretty believable.
In the title song just before the interval, there's the typical choreography with foreign women dancing all over our main hero, viz., Happy Singh. He actually asks a girl not to touch him while he's dancing. I thought it was very cute to have that in, which is consistent with his character in the rest of the movie.
Innovativeness of casting Ranvir Shorey opposite Katrina Kaif.
Katrina Kaif green dressing gown in the 'talli' song.
The whole idea of having the sidekicks of the real don go through a change of heart before the Don. If only it was not executed so perfunctorily.
The sequence where Lucky on his wheelchair was being used as a turntable on a dining table.

In the introductory action sequence, Neha Dhupia looked like she had never held a gun in her life. 
The execution of the said action sequence. It was badly put together and thus didn't look as cool as it could have been. The close-ups edited into the rest of the sequences didn't quite work.
Why is Happy in the hospital with Lucky before his other aides!?
Why was Lucky dressed in a way to be readily camouflaged into a sadhu?!
The stand-off scene between Puneet (Ranveer Shorey) and Sonia (Katrina Kaif). The dialogue is muted to give way to generic background music. Almost as if the writers got bored of writing a standard fight scene or as if they were told to cut down on Katrina's dialogues!
Uhhh...why the double role for Javed Jaffrey?

Kirron Kher for some reason is carrying a couple of dead roses in her hand in one shot, and in the following shot a bright red rose appears. Is that a symbolic way of saying the person she's talking to had brought life into her life? 
Thank you ji!Singh is kinng - Review...Punjabi is queenn. Wit is Jack. Plot & logic are thrown out of the deck. So, the viewers are ace jokers! But, who am I to stop Akshay-Katrina fans from rushing to the theaters?...Well..an expected review from u..what surprised me is that reviewers like Mayank Shekar and Raja Sen loved it..Will be watching it tomm myself..will be one of those movies that my wife will love and ill hate :-)PS: Why is that u never write Angrezi flicks reviews? It's always done by Anand. Is it because u don't watch those flicks?well.u are correct in pointing out....Akshay Kumar does dutiful justice to his Mr. goody-two-shoes, flat character, like he’s been doing for ages - be nice, dance, preach, dance, and dance some more. At least the character is consistent! read ajay brahmatmaj review...http://chavannichap.blogspot.com/2008/08/blog-post_08.htmlThanks Nareshallu!Good luck, Sudhir and let us know what you think :) Of course, I watch the English movies just don't review them. I'm a little weary of reviewing too many movies :) Rashid and Marc :)Your review comes as a fresh whiff...u won't believe but i have read reviews on singh is kinng where the critic has called the movie Welcome a masterpiece!! Movies like Singh is Kinng are made for one purpose only- to make money, and it will do that pretty well. But I don't understand why the critics are going gaga over such mediocre comedy. How can a critic give both Chak De India and Singh is Kinng the same 4 out of 5 rating?100% correct and very logical review!!!my God.....what a tight slap on the face of this dabba movie!!Do you remember the last time I commented that I took my friends for Race, and then for LS-2050, just to show them a good Hindi movie? Well, I did the mistake the third time with this one. They have vowed never to see a Hindi movie recommended by me again. Do I need to say more???@ all who loved the movie - great!@ all who hated the movie - condolences...@ vimal, of course, I remember! I must say your friends have a good taste in movies :P@Anurag, welcome back! Well, I just didn't like the music, it annoyed me the first time I heard the title song. Usually many songs grow on me over time, but this one grew in annoyance-value. Om Puri and Kirron Kher were loud and their characters redundant/inconsistent..."what else can one expect from singh is kinng"...so its okay...if we expect a good film, its trash! Hmmm...how do we sort the inconsistency?Oh Sneha, how I agree with you...There was an article in Bollywood Hungama(Indiafm.com) yesterday which claims that Vipul is planning for a sequel to SiK. It seems he is waiting for a story and once thats done, it would be finalised. Story, huh? as if this had one!!!ROFL, vimal! Another SiK...just can't stop laughing...see i was wrong, the movie was funny after all...rating:thumbs downmovie is totally unexpectable..its not about comedy rather is about a comdey on which one cant laugh...i like movie so much tat i had watched 10 times, it is one of my favourite films!!!!Yeah Saurabh,I think I almost always pick on spelling changes in hindi movies. Check out Rama Rama Kya Hai Dramaaa for your entertainment. Sometimes, I leave some out because I don't want to drag the same joke too long. And actually Saurabh, why does he call himself King in the movie, because...he's one of his kind in a pack of cards? We really don't know, do we? Even after we watch the movieIsn't that sad about lyrics, Saurabh? I refuse to believe all Punjabi's are loud as a rule!Yeah Saurabh, I'm sure I wouldn't have liked Jim Carrey do it either. Anyway, just because it's done 10000 miles away, it doesn't make it right. The thing is there are more and more director's out there who are respecting our intellect, I think we need to ask for more.

Parental Guidance:


Violence: Gang war type gun-fights sprinkled through the movie.
Sexual content: Nothing more than skimpily clad women making random appearances in songs, etc.
Concept: The basic idea is to make criminals change their ways and win hearts by being good. So, though it's silly, the motivations are right.
General Look and Feel: It's a bright, lively environment.
