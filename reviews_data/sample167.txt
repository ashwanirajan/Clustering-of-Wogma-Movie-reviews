Shaandaar is the Anees Bazmee-fication of Dharma-ised version of the Phantom-isation of Vikas Bahl's Disney tale. Oh dear, how do I fit Barjatya in that sentence now?As cynical as it is, I am always wary when almost all scenes covered in a trailer bring a smile. I worry that everything good in the movie has been captured in those two minutes and the movie will have little else to offer. However, there is some hope with Vikas Bahl holding the reins and Alia Bhat in the lead. Together, they seem to successfully make me overlook the tackiness of some of the scenes. But, tackiness there is. Sanjay Kapoor and Co come across as loud and the angle Sushma Seth's character brings seems to make it cliché. It is easy to go in with a balanced mind for this one – enough on either side of the scale. Music Reviews:

  I repeat, “Shaandaar is the Anees Bazmee-fication of Dharma-ised version of the Phantom-isation of Vikas Bahl's Disney tale. Oh dear, how do I fit Barjatya in that sentence now?” Shaandaar looks like it has been directed by six teams. To start with Vikas Bahl wanted to make a simple Disney story adding his flair of light, lively comedy. Since the setting was a big fat Sindhian wedding, it had to be the Barjatya way or the highway. The producers Phantom and Dharma brought in quirk and cheesiness respectively. How and why Anees Bazmee entered the equation has only one explanation. Their target audience was 100% of the film-watching population. And just in case you are wondering – no, it doesn't work. What does work is the lead performances – Shahid Kapoor, Alia Bhatt and Pankaj Kapoor and the songs' lyrics. It has been a long, long while since lyrics have caught my attention and kept it there. I shall buy the music for the lyrics. A shame though that the music doesn't live up to the craziness that the Vikas Bahl-Amit Trivedi duo had done an awesome job the last time they got together. So be it. Alia Bhatt bring her casual coolness to screen that is charming and you completely relate with Shahid Kapoor when he can't take his eyes off her. Shahid Kapoor himself with a very cursorily written character does a composed knight in shining armour with small weaknesses of his own. Pankaj Kapoor has his own brand of restraint that he brings here too. Some scenes with the real-life father-son duo were delightful indeed. Similarly, Shahid Kapoor and Alia Bhatt are great on screen together and could have had chemistry, had the writing allowed for it.While the trailer portrays the film quite literally as a fairy-tale romance, and the film leads you on with animated frogs, clouds, in the beginning. But, it soon becomes something else. Men wanting breaking free from their mother's tyranny. Women wanting to break free from the label, “obese”. Shaandaar also tries to trot about like a woman-empowering Queen, but doesn't manage to do that without her male leads. Undoubtedly, it is a mish-mash of ideologies, of film-making aesthetics. I cannot shake off the big question mark – why? Why would a perfectly sane director go about doing this? You can't even call this experimentation because individually every thing that the film does has been done before. Maybe, true to the film's theme – it was not a film, it was a business deal. These individual experiments too are stretched out not only beyond the point that they are novel/funny/engaging but also beyond their tolerable time limit. All stretching to a stretched out climax that is truly difficult to sit through given the director and cast. Maybe this film could've worked if it was an hour shorter, but we'll have to see it to know it. The outtakes in the end credit show that there was much more that didn't make it to the final cut. Looks like the crew had loads of fun. Thank you for keeping us out of it.

Totally unnecessary but Khair hai but tis the festive season, its OK to binge on something so sweet and fluffy it will set your teeth in edge. If KHOOBSURAT last year was the Big Pink Fairytale For Grownups; SHANDAAR just super sized it. If Queen was the small, unassuming eye of that Other India in Europe, SHANDAAR is all of Chopra and Disney on steroid. And in between are moments that just make you muse on youth... the effervescent Aaliya on parentage, later a oh well "danga" riots happen.

        ...Vikas Bahl it seems wants to establish himself as a versatile director. His first two outings (Chillar Party and Queen) were totally different from each other, apart from being really brilliant films. Shaandaar is different from his other flicks alright, but it’s far from being brilliant. Bahl’s scenes are seen falling flat most of the time, and he isn’t even able to whip out something to keep us captivated during the boring parts. He however succeeds in bringing out the best from his actors. He and the ever so impressive Anil Mehta deserve credit for capturing some jaw dropping locations as well. The film would have received a lot of help if some of its songs and unneeded sequences were chopped off, especially the cheesy bits like the Karan Johar cameo and the long and winding scene in which everyone gets accidentally drugged. The animated bits are uninspired and yet another attempt by Bahl to capture the fairy tale vibe.

Take that scene in which a gay man comes out of the closet before his relatives. It leads to a sweetly amusing response from the family that is promptly followed by a moment of stereotyping in which he aims a gun at someone with the limpest wrist ever seen in Bollywood. It’s as though two separate mindsets were operating within that idea.

Watching the film is like wading through waist-deep muck littered with dead ideas, dud characters, rotting cliches.

          :
        
        ...the film struggles to tell any one story genuinely. Even the film’s moment of triumph, coming in the last 10 minutes, feels like Vikas Bahl reminding the world that he’s the pro-woman director who made Queen. We walk in to Shaandaar expecting to meet a beautiful girl who will captivate us with insightful conversation, but instead, we meet a dumb blonde who’s just too busy filing her nails....

        ...Seriously, how was anyone to guess that this is a cruel joke played by Bahl on his investors and perhaps on an unsuspecting audience.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.This Movies are totally time wasting..The movie recorded low occupancy on Dusshera holiday and collapsed completely thereafter. This is yet another flop in flop-star Shahid Kapoor's worthless filmi career and I'm sure he's now joined the race with Abhishek and Saif to be the fastest to 100 lifetime flops.I dont think this move going to make some good records..Watching this movie gave a feeling of watching the first powerpoint presentation of a child.  Having discovered the various animations and transitions possible the child has used each of them on the various slides.  Only bright spot of the film is Alia. She has to be herself,  just a rich daughter brought up in a life of luxury whose major issues in life are which shade of lipstick and nail polish to wear today. And she does that in top form.@Fan ha ha ha ha haCopyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
