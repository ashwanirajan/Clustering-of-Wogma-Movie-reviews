wogma rating: Watch if you have nothing better to do (?)
Typical Priyadarshan fare. A few good dialogues placed randomly across the script and delivered very badly. Story stars over-insensitive men (and you thought that was not possible!) objectifying women.A host of good-for-nothings trying to make quick money to pay off the yelling landlady breathing down their necks. Heard that one before? They strike the brilliant idea of objectifying the fairer sex and start with turning into peeping Toms. But, just any woman won’t do. Not only does this particular lady have to have the perfect vital statistics, but she should also be a rich heir. Please note, there is no possibility of her being rich on her own merit. Mind you, though one woman will do for all of them put together. And of course the exaggeration plays equally on the male stereotype too. Poor things are shown to be even more insensitive than the average man, imagine that! Oh never mind, let’s move on before I get all feminist on you.Oh come on, you cannot be blaming me for giving the story away; you have seen this bit before – many times. And anyway, giving credit where it is due, there is a little more to the movie than just the foursome wooing this lady. So what, if that little more might as well have made a different movie altogether. Now, why does the name Priyadarshan come to mind?Also creditworthy is how some of the funny dialogues are slickly put in between regular lines. So, only the very attentive will get the jokes. But that’s about where the smartness ends. It pretty much doesn’t matter which character says those lines because the characters don’t have any individualistic characteristics. And it pretty much doesn’t matter where in the story those dialogues are scripted, because they could equally randomly be interspersed anywhere in the rest of the story (ies).I think it is time I stop complaining about how wasted Om Puri, Sherman Joshi, and Rajpal Yadav in their loud characters or how wooden Kunal Khemu, Tusshar Kapoor, and Tanushree Dutta are in their loud characters or how loud Asrani and Tiku Talsania are in their loud characters. In future I will try and point out things about these actors only if they are any different.Music? Lyrics? Don’t remember any of it. So, let’s just say they were very forgettable.So, except for the few funny lines and the teeny-weeny bit of curiosity aroused by the second story, there isn’t much going for this movie. But, then again, we weren’t expecting anything different from this crew, were we?

: A funny film which makes you laugh. What else is needed?
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Already covered this one in the main review this time.Already covered this one in the main review this time.
The visuals of the first song, “haadsa”, were brilliantly executed.  
The Film and Television Institute of India, Pune was aptly camouflaged to portray a regular street. The street signs showing directions looked awfully artificial, though. Not to mention that the directions were off too.
Lighting in the night scene at Sophie’s house looked very nice.

What’s with a pool table in every house?
Pray, owner of which company asks the MD to decide the MD’s pay package with the CEO?
And which owner calls his MD as “MD” instead of calling him by his name?
The costumes of the people from Zikomo’s gang. They didn’t look like goons at all. In fact they looked like geeks!
Why did Zikomo not smell the gas when he entered the kitchen?

There should be some sort-of a usability check done for the titles. They were blurry because of the font and colors used.
Also, someone should proof-read the title cards. One read, “six month later”.
When did Crossword start to rent out DVDs? Even if they did why would they give away the customer’s information to a random person. 
Review - Dhol...Typical Priyadarshan fare. A few good dialogues placed randomly across the script and delivered very badly. Story stars over-insensitive men (and you thought that was not possible!) objectifying women....A funny film which makes you laugh. What else is needed?Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
