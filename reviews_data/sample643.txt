The story - beyond the lead lady turning into a prostitute - might still have worked, I can imaginably have given that much to the writers. But, the film that it has turned into is certainly well worth hating. From acting to music to pretty much everything else, Hate Story pushes your patience to the brink. Hate Story has only one intention in mind - to titillate. At least that's what it looks like from the promo.


While director, Vivek Agnihotri's earlier film Dhan Dhana Dhan Goal rubbed in racism and jingoism, Hate Story seems to be using another 'sales tool' - sex and blatantly too. The story line reminded me of Laga Chunari Mein Daag - basically the lady having no other option but to sell her body. A little too convenient, is it not? 
Hate Story just sounds and looks too in the face and as if the writer or director is lashing out in anger at someone. Though, I must say the cine-freak in me is really curious to know how a woman messes with a tycoon in the first place and then manages to take revenge from a person without changing identities/looks/anything at all. 
The music as expected from a film of this genre and texture hasn't been received too well.

  Isn't it a shame that a woman has been so wronged by such an obnoxious man and I feel bad for her only conceptually? Only my imagination of what it must have been like evokes any kind of emotion out of me? And this is in the first half hour of the film. My exasperation only gets worse as the Hate Story progresses.

In the entire film, there are only two things that are just about okay. One is Gulshan Devaiya's stammer and the other is the attempt at making the story a business-mind game. But these are barely things that I can call that 'work' or 'are going for the film'. They just happen to be there for me to be able to say at least a few things nice about the film. Okay fine, Nikhil Dwivedi broods just about right. 
Talking about Paoli Dam's performance would involve recalling her whispering and sighing in attempt to seduce, which I'm trying my best to resist. And..."ha ha ha ha ha ha" this is a ROFL at those who went in expecting sizzling, explicit sex based on the promos. Little do they know they've seen all there is to see in the trailer itself. In fact,  the uncensored version of the trailer has even a little more than the film. And another, "ha ha ha ha ha ha" at me - for wondering, even for the slightest moment, if Hate Story would finally be the Hindi film that shows two people can be comfortable with their bodies and themselves while having sex. 
Now, the whole idea behind having the lead lady turn into a top-notch call-girl is obviously to be able to market the film. Then, I am giving it too much benefit of doubt by thinking, "Sure they didn't tell me exactly why she HAD to turn into a prostitute, but maybe it was the easiest way for her to get what she wanted." 
One thing Hate Story does a god job of, is to expose the fragility of the male ego. One male after another falls for this woman whose focus is only her revenge and not one relents even after they know the truth about her. But then again, you don't need to see a movie for that, do you? runs for shelter 
Oh, the other selling point in the trailer seemed to be the free use of cuss words. Character after character uses the f-word more awkwardly than 12-year olds who use that language. 
Unfortunately, everything in Hate Story sounds and looks contrived with the sole motivation of getting the audience to the theater - by hook or crook. And it doesn't quite work.

JaskaranGautam:
          Now talking about Hate story it an average movie and just revolves around kavya and her revenge and how she uses men to take her revenge..
        
CHANDNIKATARIA:

bhaskart69:
          Watched "Hate Story". Okayish movie. Felt the Vidya Balan would have been a better choice in the lead role.
        
arppaul:
          watched 'Hate Story,....Paoli is too bold to watch..bt d story of this film is not bad at all..:-)
        
ze_us:
          2 things - Vicky Donor is being a tad too over rated.. And secondly 'Hate Story' has no grt steamy scenes.. Moral, Go watch 21 Jumpstreet!
        
younus257:
          HATE STORY is so bold.. tat its cold.. What else can Bollywood produce. Its not erotic.. its neurotic
        
vishyblues:
          Hate Story - is thanda and boring all the helping of soft porn thrown in by ignoring logic's ends up in zero sex appeal http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/hindi/review/15372.html

Vishal_tekwani:
          I hate love stories. Now i hate hate story also
        
vijaygeorge4u:
          'Hate Story' lacks a genuine storyline. There is nothing beyond some skin show of Paoli Dam.
        
varungrover:
          Little known fact: Hate Story's original title was "Hate Story, Screenplay, Dialogue; Love Paoli Dam"
        
theuttkarsh:
          Hate Story is a hate crime against the sex-starved
        
SRGtweets:
          But Hate Story had a typical Bollywood style which made it a flop in the middle of the 2nd half ... Ppl expected more from Paoli !
        
sjoshipura:
          Hate Story 's  Direction is ok ! Background Score - Poor ! Dialoges - Nice ! Paoli (is) DAM Hott ! Sensuous ! Avoidable !
        
shyamve:
          Hate story was irritating and screwed... Paoli has shed clothes through out..
        
Shiven_007:
          Hate Story:Awful Movie
        
shadymumbai:
          Vicky Donor is as good a movie As bad a movie Hate Story is ....
        
realslimswamy:
          Hate Story is so insipid and so long that if you enter the cinema hall with popcorn, you will leave with corn-sprouts.
        
rakeshkumarkar:
          Hate Story ... what is it..!!??? Deadeningly #boring and outstandingly #mediocre ..!!
        
r1kartik:
          Could have been so much better than the eventual result.  Please dont give Vivek Agnihotri any more movies

HATE STORY

Praxticus:
          Vicky Donor..... nice movie.... liked it much more than the shitty hate story!!
        
PARAGROCKSTAR1:
          Hate story is very worst movie of the year
        
Meichirosena:
          Did anyone watch the "Hate Story?". You'd love to Hate it.
        
magiclegspratik:
          If you watch Hate Story with a lot of expectations about it being an erotic thriller you are bound to be disappointed

Rating: **
        
karrnb:
          Vicky Donor is like Hrithik Roshan . Smart ..Fun ..And gets a smile on u.. Hate story is like Rakhi SAWANT.. Saggy ..irritating and screwed
        
iSuvigya_dubey:
          Hate story. I've dared to watch it. And I advise you  NOT to watch this movie.
        
chocolatychandu:
          watched Hate Story this weekend and guess what ? I really Hated the Story...
        
BolegaGossips:
          Vikram Bhatt's erotic thriller Hate Story lacks novelty! http://ow.ly/aqqDj

ArunChakraDel:
          Bengal's Didi's name is referred twice in the film, 'Vicky Donor', already a far away winner over 'Hate Story'
        
anky666:
          Hate Story was as expected. But made up for that by meeting my bestest people later. There is something special about school friends. ♥
        
Aadii_:
          Hate story is nothing but another story to Hate. Apart from one reason, the girl failed to justify her Profession & LUST!! #bollywood
        
25hb:
          Hate story is a 1 star porn movie.

: Hate Story, interpretation : Hate The Story. Hate lots of other things as well.
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.‘Hate Story’ is a story a revenge, a revenge that a stinking rich Businessman Siddharth Dhanraj Gir aka Sid (Gulshan Devaiah) takes form a journalist Kavya Krishna (Paoli Dam) who executes a sting operation on Sid’s multi-billion company Cementec Infra with a little bit of assistance from her best friend Vicky (Nikhil Dwivedi). He almost kills Kavya and that’s when she decides to take her revenge.Stars - 3.5/5@Dattaprasad oh absolutely! it was fun enough in a multiplex too!@Kaustubh Thank for your review! You make some very valid points. The good news is that you don't have to wait, this week's other release "Vicky Donor" is a riot. A few of my Punjabi friends called to specifically point out how authentic it felt, not to mention I watched the film with a Bong friend and she was in splits at the Bengali bits. Of course, the genre is completely different, but a good movie is a good movie :DniceCopyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
