Skip it. Random, haphazard, rather pointless.Life Ki Toh Lag Gayi has only one trailer out there. Which basically means small budget, smaller marketing budget. So all it can bank on is some good, quality content in terms of writing.

It pretty much spells multiple threads, as many themes, some slapstick, some quirkiness and there you go! What it has though is a cast to look forward to. The problem with that though is that the onus on the writing increases by that much. Having a good cast act in badly written scenes with awful lines is worse than having to face either of these issues individually. 
The trailer just about outlines the various sub-plots and doesn't give an inkling to how good or bad we can expect the writing to be. So there is so much we can tell about how the film will hold up. The only thing to go by then is the trust the said cast has placed on the script and its makers. Meanwhile, there's only one music review I could find online by glamsham which gives the album a 3.5/5.
Let's hope for at least an average entertainer.

  No doubt there is something very charming about a story line that starts with different threads and merges into one coherent story by the end. Life Ki Toh Lag Gayi kills that romanticized idea. It is indeed painful to write a review when you have only bad things to say about it. Except for the one quirky character Ajay Ghosh, Life Ki Toh Lag Gayi has nothing going for it. And this is despite having a cast that consists Kay Kay Menon and Ranvir Shorey!

They do try their best, but what can they do with the little their individual threads do to contribute to the film. Individually a couple of their scenes work really well, but that's about it. But even that much cannot be said about Manu Rishi and Neha Bhasin's thread unless you call a hearty laugh at the writers, for calling Shakti Kapoor 'innocent looking', entertainment. 
Yes, it gets that crass at times. At others it alternates between plain silly and boring. It's difficult for me to get angry or hate something that a small budget film with a new director has tried to do. Life ki toh lag gayi only made me indifferent towards, which as is said, is worse than evoking hatred.

: Life ki toh lag gayi is a Tensed humorous Film , which entertains till the last, a must watch film.
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.@Dattaprasad Come to think of it, I don't think I intended it to be thought of as an insight. It was just a thought when I could find no promos on the net.Thanks a lot for this review. If Kay Kay Memon could not do any good to it, only two kind of people can dare to watch it: -1. Idiots2. Highly courageousStory in pieces@Meetu - You need to learn how to write a review for sure.. Life ki toh lag gayi is a surely a high entertaining movie . You people have given Ra one a 4 star or someone has given 4.5 star .. booh! and criticizing this creative effort. You should scare of God.@CAptian Awesome ha ha :)@Amit I don't give stars, so I didn't quite understand what you are saying.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
