It's a shame that actors are brilliant with their comic-timing are made to over-act, be loud, sleazy and outright disgusting. Any little trust you might have in the "scripts" they choose, is misplaced.Makers of such slapsticks suffer from a huge superiority complex. By such slapstick, I mean, the ""ball hits balls" and again and again" kind of "comedy". And the makers' arrogance is transparent. Obviously they are intelligent people. They have raised  finances for such a dumb product. And yet they have this condescending attitude towards their audience. Or maybe, having money and knowing what to do with it, requires two different types of intellect.

Even so, we know for a fact that Arshad Warsi, Riteish Deshmukh, Jaaved Jaaferi AND Sanjay Dutt are capable of so much more. Heck, even Ashish Chaudhury can do a better job with overacting than this. And yet, they chose this film. They couldn't be that out-of-work, could they? Miss Cleavage-Kangna-Cleavage-Ranaut-Cleavage and Mallika Sherawat did a better job than any of the guys, imagine that! Well, then again, that's only relative.
The thing is the film has a plot that had huge potential to be funny. Four good-for-nothings trying to out-smart a smart aleck ex-cop. But if you are not going to get the least bit creative about your characters, how am I supposed to get interested? Save Maanav (Jaaved Jaaferi), the other three good-for-nothings have no distinguishing characters. They all can mimick, they can all role-play, they can all pull-off a disguise. Even though the disguises were well done and could actually conceal identity, the changed identities remained pretty much the same. Why have three different characters? Oh, too much money and we know not what to do with it, I forgot.
If they didn't feel the need to work on a plot or characters, the least they should've tried is get a laugh or two out of us, right? Whole eggs crack in the mouth, and a guy chews on his boxer's naada (the string that holds the boxer shorts up) - they make me squeeze my eyes close and I can taste the disgust. In that sense then, I could feel what the characters felt. Sigh
Neither do the umpteen references to other films or actors from the industry reach out to my funny bone. There is this slight comment the makers want to make about the babas (spiritual gurus) are no better or worse than goons from the underworld. But, the whole sub-episode is so loud that you couldn't bother yourself with subtext. 
On the other hand, the film does try to laugh at itself. There's a comment about the foursome, "they look like crooks" That is true. All four of them look straight out of the goon-factory - shady and repulsive. Then there are these two scenes where Sanjay Dutt makes a "I don't have patience for this anymore" expression, mimicking what's running through the audience's minds at those exact points. Yet you cannot forgive them for taking you for a fool.
Another film that takes the audience for granted. Another one that would make the lousy sms forwards more interesting than the supposed smart-quips. Another one for you to skip and so you can enjoy the monsoons.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.The good for nothing comedy is back again with a bang. The movie Double Dhammal essentially a series of the earlier Dhamaal is full of stupidity by the four stars. They want to kiss success without working hard, that is the only way they want to survive, but fate has a different game for them.The first part was much better.Double dhammal drags a lot after the interval and there are repeated jokes.This is ok for one time watch if you have nothing else to do.i am bored of slapstick.....they don't make me laugh at all.all those comedy shows in TV same old gags and pranks,comedy isn't as good as it was with nearly 70% of Bollywood craps being them............it has really diluted over the years.i won't spare my money for this..........torrent z will be available in two days .I loved that aeroplane scene in the first movie. Looks like there will be nothing similar in this one. :(@Sanjeev i agree, and better is a relative term.@Guddu i'd say torrent is not worth it either.@Rahul yeah, i loved it too. nothing close to it in this one!@Swapnil Haven't seen the film, so I don't know.@shashank I completely agree with every point you make. The thing is even if a lot of other people like a film, I cannot say I liked when I didn't. And this is all I say here. That I didn't like the film. @Pragya I'm sure even people who have loved the film will agree that the film is pretty low on intelligence. In fact, that is what is entertaining about the film for the people who like that kind of films.I was trying to point out that the makers are really intelligent that they could raise funds for the film, which is not so intelligent. It was not a financial comment, it was a plea to film-makers who are obviously intelligent to bring some sense into their product.Pragya, I never said movie-goers are dumb because I don't think so. I think we are an evolved and intelligent audience that ought to be treated as such.I would be super-annoyed if every film was a Gulaal because there is no imagination in that. Light-hearted entertainment is what I was looking for and I didn't get it, thus the suggestion to save others' time. :D.since am too a part of junta here's my opinion pragyaji. It's not about intelligence it's about art,an art which can turn a dumb attempt to intellectual.Now i know the standard of indian filmakers who will never apply their brain and that's why you said every film shouldn't be gulaal.your right but what about the essence,logic,clarity which are the qualities of a good film.This movie doesn't had any of these.if u enjoy this i won't question ur judgement.And don't think that a person who writes verdict of a film in newspaper and website has only intelligence.Take a look at aam janta who are far better than them (professor,teachers,graduates,scholars)which includes you too.@shashank @guddu :DCopyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
