I physically had my head in my hands during the grand finale. Yep, it is that kind of a film. My kids and I play this game every Friday ever since they were 8-9. As soon as they are back from school they ask, “What was the movie about?” Invariably for almost every romantic film I say, “Boy meets girl, and guess what happens next...” And they say in unison (these days with an eyeroll), “love?” The odds are against Befikre even more since the boy and girl have promised each other to not say the three golden words. As is the trend with love stories these days, the couple in question has to have a quirk to bond over. This once it seems to be the “dare” game. The dares and their execution were yawn inducing in the trailer itself. I hope Befikre isn't going to spend too much time establishing their daredevilry because I “got” it.Ranveer Singh and Vaani Kapoor don't look like they are calling on their acting chops in the first half at least. Interestingly, the all-important twist has not even been hinted at in the one trailer I saw. I would like to keep it that way. However, given the exposition in the trailer, it is unlikely that it will be anything unpredictable. Here's hoping it is anyway.

  We usually talk about Hindi films in terms of first half and second half. Befikre had me think of it in one-eighths, where the seven-eighth part of the film looked like it could be a film different from what I was expecting it to be. For that bit, with the characters, the film felt as though it was taking a mature look at relationships - especially the romantic kind. But nada. Instead we nosedive with the film to a thud. Befikre, has the now-getting-old theme of lust vs. love vs. friendship. In such films, one overpowers the other two at any given point. But, we more or less, know the direction. It is the situations and the dialogue that have a chance to make the film engaging. The “dare” game in Befikre, which seems to be the source of all bonding between Shyra (Vaani Kapoor) and Dharam (Ranveer Singh) doesn't cut it. The couple then follows the usual pattern in their falling apart. There is one difference though. Usually, it is the female lead who is intolerably shrill in such fights, here Ranveer Singh matches Vaani Kapoor note for note. This makes the first five minutes of the film intolerable outright. Other than that though the duo don't annoy again and get back into tolerable zone. They are playing smart, urban characters who are bold about their desires and clear about their needs. It wouldn't be a surprise if the actors are playing their real-life personalities, right? That's why it doesn't sound or look too impressive. These characters aren't all black and white. They do seem confused about things that some of us might take for granted like commitment and not hurting other people. They flip-flop between their wants and don't wants. They have way too many change of hearts for us to keep track. We are used to seeing all of this in our films, and some of them we like more than others. Befikre just doesn't entertain or engage and gets outlandish by the end of it all. There are lots of Aditya Chopra parallels to be drawn – from the change in role of parents to the shift in focus of romance to the changing nature of love over these last three decades. But, it feels as if, in his effort to be “free from his own cinematic traps”, he hasn't been able to wriggle out too far. The changes seems a little too perfunctory rather than germane to the story. The only thing that felt relatively relevant in the story is that the protagonists have “new-age”, cool-ish jobs that kind-a sort-a get in the way of their relationship. I guess that the woman has a job is new-age enough for us. Never mind. That the storyteller in him had to adopt a non-linear style of narration gives away the fact that he wasn't too sure about holding the viewers' attention with the story as is. And of course, it seems like no one can help self-referencing these days. That aside, none of the supposedly “aawwww” moments reach out. None of the supposedly “crazy” moments feel crazy enough or real. There are only so many times that we can believe a person getting away with offending the authorities in France (or anywhere for that matter). There are only so many times we can see the whole world revolve around the lead pair - which is no more restricted to background dancers in songs. The biggest put-off is that grown-ups behave like juveniles when in love. They behave as if they've never heard of age-old problems like toilet seats and wet towels. Makes you wonder if the writers have experienced real life, real relationships – those outside the movie world.

At the Box- Office, it will be loved and appreciated by the target audience. The masses might find the subject bold and shocking; however, they will be in a minority to make any sizeable impact to its box office prospects. A Sure-shot winner all the way....

You will find the movie very disappointing and average if you are looking only at the storyline. But look out for the intricacies of his characterization and at how Adi has portrayed the female character. I will give 2.5 the movie, and a .5 extra just for Vaani’s performance and Adi’s portrayal of women

Befikre is like a bubbly Cola; drink it, let the bubbles dance on your tongue momentarily and then forget it.

        ...Conclusion: Befikre is the boldest movie Aditya Chopra has ever made, and even in his boldness he has made sure to not let go of his Punjabiness. The characters he has created are carefree and impulsive, and the urban youth will identify with these characters. Befikre starts off really really well with one of the breeziest first halves we have seen this year, and isn’t able to hit those highs in the second half and falls into a trap of clichés. But Befikre deserves to be watched. Why? For the chemistry of the lead couple and for the director who has tried his level best to try something new even at the cost of coming across as brash.

          It's annoying, because it's not a bad film. Befikre's actually decent, and has some really funny moments. It's just disappointing.
        
iamrizkhan8970:
          Watched Semi Porn #Befikre . Okay movie. Its all about Kissings and Sex scenes. #Vaani showed everything while #Ranveer was funny.

VirkSh786:
          For some fans Aditya Chopra has made #Befikre just to pass the time and his real film will come with Srk. Ok, can I make films for fun too!?

          Bollywood fans,
U may go crazy with your good looking actors flaunting their bodies, but U can hardly go crazy for a good script 
        
ekManzil:
          But a rom-com works only if you are invested into the romantic/emotional part of movie which is very much not the case here. #Befikre

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Knew that the movie will be average , but didnt knew that it would be such a disaster. Allover response is so bad.And imdb Ratings are laughable. Some more money saved. Another movie to skip.Really a time waste and unwatchable!Its really a Time waste movie :/The movie is an average movie not that good. It is just like friends with benefits. But the Songs of the movie are good.very nice movie for adult.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.

Parental Guidance:


Violence: None
Language: Few abusive words used
Nudity & Sexual content: A lot of the movie is about lust. There is one flash of a scene with unexpected show of skin to – yes more than you have grown accustomed to.
Concept: Lust, love, lust, what is love, friendship, lust, love, what is...you get the drift. 
General Look and Feel: Crisp visuals set in pretty Paris.
