Student of the Year picks of several themes of love, friendship, parenting, unhealthy competition in society. But it does no justice to even one of them. It turned out to be pretty bad eventually but yet not as awful as I thought it'd be. Something about the way love is depicted in the trailers of Student Of The Year says 'old school' (all pun intended). The love triangle, the songs, the overall look and feel is extremely mid-90s. The dances from the 'it's the time to diso'-ish 'disco diwane' to 'maahi ve'-ish 'Radha', only with worse music, lyrics and choreography makes you feel Bollywood has gone two steps behind in using music in their films. I thought we had grown past the structured, lip-synced songs. I guess not. The only 'new generation' element then that Student Of The Year can truly boast of is the fact that all characters seems to be smart alecs and they inhabit a cut-throat world. A lot needs to be said about the new age romance portrayed in the trailers though. Doesn't look like Generation Next has moved on from the mush of Karan Johar films, except for using lousy language, I guess. 'Ishq wala love'? Really?And what's old is being weaned out of its charm. Somehow, the bit you can see of Rishi Kapoor seems like a huge let down and a step back to him big a caricature. Let's hope there are some moments that will make sitting through what looks like puppy love worth it. Unlike what you'd expect from a Karan Johar film, the music doesn't seem to the cut the bill though.Music Reviews:
Milliblog - "perky, enjoyable – albeit predictable "
Music Aloud – "6.5/10"
dunkdaft - "Can't believe this is the soundtrack of a KJo film ! Vishal-Shekhar has given some great sounds through this year. Here, its opportunity wasted or  performance (producer) pressure ?"
Bollywood Hungama – "4/5"
Apun Ka Choice – "4/5"

  Karan Johar tries to take a peek into the minds of the youth of today. While he does try to balance their dark and human sides, I'd still like to think there is more to our youth than the shollowness that goes with jealousy and excessive competitiveness. Even if there is an attempt to counter it with some large-heartedness and semblance of maturity every once in a while. Ultimately, the situations created are too fake to be credited with a connect to any generation's thought process.The uneven narrative makes it even more difficult to digest as a story. It's neither a fairy tale nor stems from reality for us to take it seriously. The build-up in the first 20 minutes towards an ominous event that occurred 10 years ago is trying to hard to get you interested. But various characters breaking the fourth wall and talking to you as an audience directly  is disconcerting and doesn't let you absorb the story. Between cinematic techniques, I wonder what is worse a voiceover or people talking to you through the screen, especially when it gets more than a couple of sentences. Anyway, through this medium you are introduced to Rohan (Varun Dhawan), Shanaya (Alia Bhatt) and Abhimanyu (Siddharth Malhotra)- supposedly 'stars' of the next generation. While their characters are a nice mix of black and white and raise a hope that if not profound or insightful, something mildly heart-warming and at least surprising might spring our way, A lot of credit for this hope goes to the actors. Not only do they look good, but they show glimpses of talent though it might yet to be fully exploited. It could also have to do with the fact that I thought all three of them would be mere show pieces. Student of the Year also tries to touch upon various themes. The impropriety of the stress laid on competitiveness and absolutely unacceptable parenting style being two of them. Another one that comes up is the status of people who are not-so-good-looking and not-so-rich. But these come in so abruptly and unexpectedly that they take you away from the basic love triangle brewing between the three main leads. The resolution of this love conflict itself is hardly explored, it is just stated as a fact. Ultimately, you can't help but feel that  the story tries to take in a lot more than it can chew.In addition, of course you have Karan Johar's standard  take on homosexuality. While Rishi Kapoor does grant it as much authenticity as he possibly can, I have always found Karan Johar's depiction more mocking than accepting. The songs do nothing but add to the length of the film. The choreography is lackluster, the tribute to songs and films from yesteryears via remixes don't make them any more watchable or bearable. And by the last song you just want it to be done with sooner rather than later. While I must admit that Student of the Year wasn't as bad as I expected, it still doesn't engage or have anything magnificently different to offer. The comments on the education or parenting system are to superficial to make any impact.

Venkta_s:
          Avoid SOTY. poor star cast, below average music, predictable story.

sunilganesh:
          Student Of The Year : there was nothing worthwhile in the movie. Lacks a good story and acting. Forgetful stuff.

          completely underdeveloped characters...no doubt SOTY is Karan Johar worst...he steals from 3 idiots, jane tu, Goblet of fire, kuch kuch...
        
manisha_jha:
          Wish KJo gave the money for #SOTY to Anurag Kashyap...am sure he would do wonders with it...he would have produced 3 movies for sure :):)
        
MahekChandak:
          SOTY...felt too old for such schoolish stuff :P ...only good thing abt the movie was Varun Dhawan.
        
k_nandini:
          Farida Jalal and Rishi Kapoor are the only positives in a film where underage sex parades as puppy love http://disbursedmeditations.blogspot.in/2012/10/underage-sex-parades-as-puppy-love.html #SOTY

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Rohan (Varun Dhawan), Shanaya (Alia Bhatt) and Abhimanyu (Siddharth Malhotra) are students at a fancy college which has a competition every year to award a student with the award for Student of the Year. Love brews, so does competition and jealousy.Rohan (Varun Dhawan), Shanaya (Alia Bhatt) and Abhimanyu (Siddharth Malhotra) are students at a fancy college which has a competition every year to award a student with the award for Student of the Year. Love brews, so does competition and jealousy.
The 'papa kehte hai' turning into 'who cares!?'
The sports choreography at some places. 
The background music and picturisation in the marriage sequence till it gets to the typical close-up of the hands.
A gay couple in the dance.

The 3 Idiots style of opening.
The character introductions 
Sushma Seth for half a shot. Why have her at all?
Use of O M G.
How do the students know who is poor and who is rich when they haven't even met each other? 
The rich-poor divide. The chamchas of the rich guys were from middle-class backgrounds too, so the rich did hang out with the not-rich students too. 
The toilet humor
The mom asking daughter if she was using techniques like push-up bras and flirtatious BBMs to get the rich guy!
Playboy T-shirts, really? 
The overdone jealousy in the massage on beach scene. 
The talk of dates for the dance sequence, but no one really was dancing with their partner.
The way the triathlon is shot, nothing creative or engaging at all. 
@Harsh bingo! ;)O M G! @Swapnil a brilliant pardody after a long, long time. Thank you. Made my day, and made SOTY worth it too :PA typical KJO film with overdone stylisation, too many shots of guys showing their bodies, gay jokes.etc It has a good concept and many scenes are well treated but overall a decent film thatz it Amongst actors Siddharth and Varun are both fabAlia is good enough but in 1 emotional scene I felt she could be betterThe best part is Rishi Kapoor as the Gay DeanRonit Roy and Ram Kapoor are decent...thanks for the review ... i kind of feared the same...Btw Siddharth looked far richer then Varun and didnt look a middle class guy.... Again problem of overstylisation in KJO films btw kudos to Keyoze Irani the fat guy a customary joke in Bollywood films... Keyoze is son of Boman Irani@Saurabh yep!@Vishal well, there you go...@Silvan yep!Direction: 2    Story: 1.5    Lead Actors: 3    Character Artists: 2    Dialogues: 2    Screenplay: 2    Music Director: 2    Lyrics: 2Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.

Parental Guidance:


Violence: A couple of fist fights
Language: A couple of abusive words are hinted at and one is spelt out in Hindi almost as the mantra of the film, though it isn't repeated too many times.
Nudity & Sexual content: Skimpily clad men and women throughout the film.  One liplock.
Concept: That of friendship and love. 
General Look and Feel: Bright and peppy, full of song and dance.
