Expectations met. Action-packed, lots of Hrithik Roshan and Katrina Kaif, passable stunt and close to no story.Action-packed, barely acceptable CGI for this scale of a film, Bang Banglooks like it is going to be yet another film that wants to be cool but will fall short at many levels. The trailer doesn't even attempt telling us the story. It is clear we are being asked to come to the theaters purely for the action.I don't mind an action film at all, thought I won't say I'd have a problem if it had a reasonably interesting story attached to it. But, the least I'd ask for is decent action - at least some of it that I haven't seen before. Something that feels like it is more than just a lift-off from some or the other hollywood high-octane action drama. Some element of creativity. Doesn't help that director, Siddharth Anand doesn't have  the greatest track record. The first two beats of the theme music refer to the Mission Impossible series' theme music. So, we can see what Bang Bangis aspiring towards and we also know originality is going to be hard to find here. The focus is clearly on style and oomph. And just in case, you thought Hrithik Roshan doesn't have oomph enough, Katrina Kaif has been added to the mix, just to make sure. As you can tell, I don't expect to be awestruck by Bang Bang. I'm just hoping to be at least be taken by surprise every once in a while. That's not too much to ask, is it?Music Reviews:

  You have to grant that Bang Bang delivers what it promises in the trailers. Lots of action, just about tolerable stunts, a bit of coochie-coo between the incredibly good-looking lead pair and lots of on-screen time for the two, individually and together - all of it pretty much mindless, with no attempt at creating any interest in the plot itself.Some of the stunts do look cool, especially for those of us who are not exposed to enough Hollywood. That seems to be Bang Bang's first selling point - Bang Bang, the machine gun kind and not the other kind that the movie itself admits there isn't enough of. You have the works - bikes, cars, race cars even, choppers, boats, water skis and what not. You have Hrithik Roshan flying down buildings and cliffs and emerging up from the deep seas. But, you know they are there just for the sake of being there. More of the "cool" idea leading to its insertion in the film rather than the story requiring the creativity of the cool idea. Pretty much same goes for the film's second selling point - Hrithik Roshan and Katrina Kaif - the gorgeous looking people that they are, they supposedly don't require character devlopment, depth or even a half-decent story or even decent chemistry. Just the presense of the actors ought to keep the audience happy. For the sake of completeness, then I will mention the most obvious - their abdominal muscles certainly worked out more than the facial muscles. Body language? Baah! Who needs that when you have the body? Any attempt at injecting emotion then, seems farcical. Not that emotion has much of a place in this film. So what, if it's has patriotism at its chore and wants to be a revenge drama. You'd think there would be a little more room for good song and dance in a film like this, especially given Hrithink Roshan's presence. But that too is too much to ask for. Just in case, you are still wondering, the entire plot is pretty much pointless given the "twist" in the climax. Since the film then has no  more selling points, it resorts to blatant product placements so much so that after Krrish 3 now, I have started associating Hrithik Roshan with product placement. And yet, I can't completely put the film down. At least, true-blue action stunts are being attempted. They might not have been executed well, but hopefully it will get better with the next film or the next. Meanwhile, though this is meant for some other long weekend, one which has the film running on TV with the luxury of flipping channels.

        ...Overall, the film's wide release during the long holiday should definitely work in its favour. Add to that, the popular starcast of the film will ensure that the movie sails through comfortably at the box-office. Another plus point to BANG BANG is that it has the least opposition from HAIDER at the box-office. So, if you are looking high-octane action scenes, sleek visuals, melodious music and if you love masala movies, then BANG BANG should definitely be your pick for this extended weekend...

Low on logic and more on frills and airs, the best thing about Bang Bang is Hrithik Roshan. He sincerely drives the film with his swagger and hot bod droolworthy looks, with Katrina aiding him with her cutesy innocence. But the lack of inventiveness in Bang Bang irks me. When I am done with ogling at the stunts and stars, I have nothing to remember it by...

So did Danny Denzongpa, who can make the most senseless thing credible just by his presence. On that note, someone needs to tell Jaaved Jaaferi that moving your head like you woke up from the wrong side of the bed, doesn’t really make one look intense and evil. ...

        ...Dum? Well, except for Hrithiks dances and thrilling action stunts there is absolutely not much dum in this weak remake
of Hollywod film 'Knight and Day'. The movie lacks the excitement and entertaining factor required for such films and will still cash in over its brilliant marketing strategies and festive holidays attached to it. We cannot blame Hrithik for giving us a half baked film as he had mentioned earlier, only that 'Bang Bang' is on the lines of 'Dhoom 2', but we never knew it would be a line below it. Thus, on over all basis would re-term 'Bang Bang' as 'Bland Bland' version of 'Knight and Day'....

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.The Kohinoor is stolen and that is supposed to put some India-UK treaty at stake. Go figure.The Kohinoor is stolen and that is supposed to put some India-UK treaty at stake. Go figure.
The one shot where Hrithik Roshan jumps out of the ocean.
Hrithik Roshan's abs even if they are too perfectly chisseled and might have had a little help from an image editing tool.
Loved the "Rubik's cube".
action choreography in the sweets shop.

Katrina Kaif's first shot has her in a shower. Really? There isn't even an attempt at masking her function in the film. 
What's with professional killers who don't want to jump over a little broken bridge?!  
How come Jaaved Jaffery's characte doesn't know who Katrina Kaif's character is. Her photo is in the newspaper!  
Katrina Kaif's self-esteem issues.
Movie is a remake of KNIGHT AND DAY,,  which has been considered as one of the least good movies by Tom Cruise.... Although Hritik have promised that Bang  Bang is better then Knight and Day....Hopefully they have worked on the story because they definatly cant match the action......Knight and Day was an out and out entertainer - action combined with humour.  I must have seen it several times.  The first time I saw it in theare, my immediate reaction thereafter was that this movie if remade in Hindi would become a blockbuster, and especially if Hrithik plays the lead role.I am dying with expectations to see what my dream prediction of Hindi remake with Hrithik and Katrina is going to give as results.  Hoping for the best, with such a strong script the director has to really mess up terribly for the final product to be rejected by masses.Siddharth himself confessed to have hated Knight & Day but one of the members from Fox Star Studios mentioned that Knight & Day was more of a Bollywood masala film made in English with Hollywood actors. And perhaps he was spot on. If a content less Dhoom-2 can entertain us the way it did based on HR and his style factor alone, Bang Bang should only be better. Hoping for the best; fingers crossed!Just watched the full trailer of BANG BANG,,,,and i can see some Rmotional melodrama coming on its way......Just hoping  least of it .....Any melodrama will spoil the mood of the movie.....@Fan @Anup and @Anuj I love the anticipation for a film. What a kick just to expect so much from a film. :DIts an outstandingly slick and stylish trailer. Especially HR's sea stunt. Yet again Meeta Kabra seems to be needlessly nitpicking and criticizing a movie only because its a mainstream commercial venture. I'm afraid (although I hope not) that she's gonna join the league of Raja Sen and Mihir Fadnavis pretty soon.Fox Star Studioshas revealed the budget of Bang Bang......and its 140 crores(more than Krish 3) (including Prints &Advertising) .......Now that's a really big amount......Looks like Hritik (30crores), Katrina and the action director Andy Armstrong( The Amazing Spiderman 2 fame) have charged quite a lot of money.......It would be a little difficult to dig out much profit out of that........@Anup : Dhoom 3 had a cost of 150-175 cr while Kick was in the same range. These big production ventures comfortably recover investment through non theatrical avenues and brand endorsements as well, at least from the producers' point of view. Its the distributors and exhibitors who are heavily reliant on theatrical performance of these films.Meeta's rating would either be "Watch if you have nothing better" or "Even the keen wait for dvd". I's be surprised if its anything beyond!@Anuj - like I said to Meetu about WE ARE FAMILY, an open remake of the American film STEPMOM, "Don't follow us, Bollywood! We don't know where the Hell we're going!" Believe me, if KNIGHT & DAY had been made in India, it would have been more entertaining....I - kind of want to see it. Sure it'll be a stupid entertainer - but I like stupid entertainers, and I like both the leads.@TimELiebe: Agree with you that some Hollywood movies when made in India are more "time-pass" or in your words "stupid entertainers".  They will not pass the buck with more reviewers - but then who cares.In that category, I enjoyed the (unofficial) remake of Hitch (Maine Kyun Pyaar Kiya) much more than I enjoyed Hitch.  Completely stupid no brainer, but somehow totally enjoyable.Sorry, meant Partner and not Maine Kyun Pyaar Kiya.@Fan @Tim : If that's the definition of a "stupid entertainer" then imo every Bond film, MI film and many more are nothing more than candy floss "stupid entertainers". Of course the colonial minded wannabe pseudo intellects and wannabe critics who go orgasmic at the mention of the word "Hollywood" (read critics of Rediff,Firstpost and a few more) would beg to differ with me.Really ! u think Casino Royal , Skyfall , MI-1 , MI -3 and MI-4 along with Bourne Series are stupid entertainers....They are far more better in their script and execution as compared to (as u said)candy floss KNIGHT and DAY.....M not saying that Knight and Day was a bad movie,,,,but that doesn't bring it to the list of great movies.....@Anuj I agree that these films are no masterpieces,but they know that they are stupid and fun films and hence decide to keep the runtime below 2 hrs however the bollywood directors take these films too seriously adding ridiculous backstories and unwanted songs like the case in hand,while knight and day ended well below(fortunately)2hrs,Bang bang drags on(mercilessly)for more than 2 1/2 hrsThe movie is stupid and dragged on for too long.Hritik was the sole good factor abou the movie.Well I guess this is what you get if you skip a beautiful movie like HaiderYes it was less on intelligence level,,,,as expected,,,,but it has given what it has promised...Action sequence are good but short lived,,,,our hero have killed everyone too easily....And forget about the loopholes and a lot of cinematic liberties.....Also forget about the product placement,,,and also forget about Kat's fav line in the movie 'KAUN HO TM' which she repeats again and again and again,,,,and forget about how actor like Dany can be wasted and wait forget about two unsituational songs(except Tu Meri which appear smoothly with the flow),,,,oh sry i forgot the last one,,,,lastly forget about the pre climax scene which could have been the climax if had not been expanded to some more F1 chase sequence to add more to the length of the movie....wohffff.......If u can forget this all things,,,,atleast,,,,,,than Bang Bang will be a great film for u.....A popcorn entertainer which delivers what it promises. If you're a fan of the Dhoom films, this one's a tad better at least in terms of the stunts and action sequences. PS: Rajveer of Bang Bang is Aryan of Dhoom2 on steroids!@Anup : My comment about MI and BOND films being "stupid entertainers" was with reference to the earlier comment made by Fan. Of course I loved these movies, but the fact remains that they're nothing more than popcorn entertainers in a Hollywood context just like the Dhoom series, Race and Bang Bang are popcorn entertainers in the Bollywood context.Bang Bang is getting negative to mixed reviews from the crtics while it is getting mixed reviews from the public however it suits the taste of its audience should reach 185 cr because of clash with Haider.I liked Hrithik's challenge to Shahid.  Bravo to both movies.Despite all the talk about Salman,  Hrithik is a masala action actor in his own right though he is yet to match the box office success of Salman Khan.Hrithik has done enough experimentation over the last decade courtesy Lakshya,Koi Mil Gaya,Jodhaa Akbar,Guzaarish and ZNMD. None of them are masala action films. He's a jack of all trades and his next with Ashutosh Gowarish is once again a period drama. I wish people used some sense before writing illogical comments.My review of Bang Bang - 3/5http://bollywoodboxofficedata.blogspot.in/2014/10/bang-bang-review.htmli guess this one didn't work out for me because of continuous over acting of Hrithick Roshan.....he should work in movies that actually require him to work within a mask or in the role of mentally unstable characters like guArish or koi mil gaya....classy action movies should be left to ilk of Salman khan....he is popular, better dancer and much better actor ....even Katrina seemed awkward romancing hrithick....in fact hrithick was trying to be so metrosexual that at one point their romance looked more like Les***n porn...Anuj - And i want to say that they are not just popcorn movies for Hollywood audience,,,MI series , Bond series and Bourne Series are the best example of last decade of being yes audience entertaining movies and high grosser but along with critical acclaim , high on intelligence and award winners......In India most popcorn movies like in case of Bang Bang are criticized by the critics....and not liked by all the audience...So for me Bang Bang cannot be put in the category of above movies i mentioned,,,rather they are more on the category of Transformers and FAST and FURIOUS series,,,which are yes popcorn entertainers but not award winners or Critically acclaimed....If you can understand what i want to say.....@Anup : You give too much weightage to the so-called critics, forgetting the fact that most critics (be it Hollywood or Bollywood critics) are just normal parts of the audience (like me & u) with better writing skills and an experience of watching more number of films. These guys aren't meant to be taken as seriously as some film-makers and their fans do. In fact some critics are so outrightly repulsive and ridiculous, you can literally preempt the nonsense they're gonna come up with.In hindsight, I would have to say that these are the kinda movies tailormade for Hrithik Roshan with that physique, look and the suave stylish personality. He looks so much at ease playing a Mr.A or a Rajveer as compared to his characters in films like ZNMD and Agneepath. Now if only he could get better directors to direct him than the likes of Sanjay Gadhvi and Siddharth Anand.Looking at a film like Bang Bang, I so wish Farhan Akhtar had casted HR in the DON remake as the suave sophisticated don, a role that SRK messed up quite badly!@Anuj: Hrithik has usually given his finest performances with Farhan. Remember Lakshya and ZNMD.SRK as Don the first Indian actor to be nominated at Asian Film Awards for best actor, SRK rocks as Don except for his physique and voice, but this not part of acting.Bang Bang  -  45.71cr in 2 days.  Regional versions dropped by 40%.@ehinome: srk rocks as don except for his physique and voice.  Reminds me of Satish Kaushik's comefy scene with Govinda where he says that except my physique and colour and height and voice, I am like Salman Khan.Waiting to read another of your nice joke.SRK, average height, average acting skills, average or poor looks, limited single screen following but still India's most influential actor,figure out any sense in it.Get ready for Happy New Year, Farah-SRK 3, a blockbuster collaboration(franchise) in the likeness of Dhoom.  All records in India will visit the dustbin post-diwali.ROFLMAO!!! Another SRK fanatic going bonkers...dude, your rants are suitable for SRK fanclubs on facebooks and blogsites. Happy New Year will be as pungent a film as Tees Maar Khan and will go the Ra.1 way at the box office. SRK has never managed a BO record till date. Even his biggest hit DDLJ couldn't get past HAHK while 'Che'nnai Express was decimated by Dhoom3 (Aamir's worst film in the lst 8 years) left, right and center. [part of comment deleted for personal attack] wait for Aamir-Hirani to deliver Hindi cinema yet another masterpiece with PK!SRK-Farah : Main Hoon Na : Ordinary HIT, OSO: Super Hit (still below Dhoom 2 of 2006).     Hrithik-Rakesh : 4 films, 4 blockbusters and 3 of them being top grossers.     SALMAN-SOORAJ BARJATYA : 2 of the biggest hits of Hindi cinema folklore (MPK AND HAHK)...AAMIR-HIRANI : Just wait and watch!   [part of comment deleted for personal attack] is not even aware that SRK's most successful directors have been Adi Chopra and Karan Johar with DDLJ,KKHH,K3G and RNBDJ.Farhan Akhtar had himself gone on record in 2006 saying that DON was first offered to Hrithik 'coz of his looks,suave mannerisms and sophisticated action performing ability. Its just that he was too caught up with Krrish and Dhoom-2 at the time and hence couldn't commit to the film. I just wish he had!Back to Bang Bang, its getting a mixed response from the audiences (as expected). The clash with Haider will have a 20-25 cr impact on the final tally an with a 50% word of mouth, it will end up at 150-160 cr. SEMI HIT (hoping for the best)Infact Bang Bang will is going the way of Ra.one and it will be a controversial hit.Rajveer is more or less an unmasked Krrish on canabinnoids.Producers;  We will give you Bang Bang (perfect combination of porn and shootouts)  Audience;  You gave us neither rather we got Bhaag Bhaag we were stuck in between these word(s) like Milkha.[comment deleted for personal attack]I went into the cinema expecting a superhero. What I got was a skeleton specializing in toilet humour and flirting with the airport security guard in [part of comment deleted for personal attack]     I went expecting a suave gangster, i ended up watching an ass trying to be suave in [part of comment deleted for personal attack]    I went in expecting an emotionally powerful love story, I watched a clownish joke of a jawan huffing and puffing his way through KAB tak hai jaaaaan!!! (phew)    I went in expecting a superfast masala entertainer, I got a sleeper class 'Che' 'Che' express!!@anuj You really don't like SRK,so why do you take the effort to go see this movies again and again and btw Bang Bang is no better than the movies you have mentioned@Gokul : Relax man! My commecnts are in response to the clown commenting above. And yes indeed I have not watched an SRK film in a cinema since Ra.1 in 2011. As for Bang Bang, its indeed more entertaining and watchable than any of the Srk starrers in the last 6 years. At least Bang Bang got a suave stylish lead who's in full flow performing daredevilry at its best to entertain us! I can just imagine had he done the stunts in the 2 Don films with someone like a Farhan Akhtar directing him.So a wogma user has become [comment deleted due to use of abusive language]88 tweet reviews  -  3.4/5 a bad one 4 is standard for this segment.29 Critics reviews -  1.5/5.  This is what we call critical unacclaim has been rejected by even overseas critics despite all its gloss.Many persons call SRK the king of overseas, nut taking a look @ the US box office he is yet to get 200 screens for a film, while HR has achieved this feat three times.  List of Hindi films to have featured in 200 screens or more in the US/Canada  Kites (2010)  Besharam (2013)  Krrish 3 (2013)  Dhoom 3 (2013)  Bang Bang (2014)Bang Bang opened @ No 12 in the US box office with $ 1.27M from 271 screens making it the highest opener for HR, had collected $ 0.17M from previews.   Enough for now; time to wait for diwali when we shall say Happy New Year to all cinema lovers.The above wogma user is definitely [part of comment deleted because it is a personal attack]I have watched both Bang Bang  and Haider. Haider is far better than Bang Bang.Hrithik what a comeback... Hrithik and katrina are looking awesome togather.....according to me it was bad luck for haider to release with bang bangSaareka - may be u havnt seen the grossing of these movies.....There are big chances that Haidar will double up its expenses which is approx 40crores by the end of third week.....In comparison to which Bang Bang which is made on a big budget of 140 crores cant make income double to its expenses....Just considering the domestic grossing....Truth is that both the movies have taken big advantage of 5days festival season plus no big release in next two weeks.....Any of the two movie released in any non festival season despite being a solo release couldnt have grossed this much.....So its no bad Luck for either of them....@Anup : Haider has a cost of 40 cr and its first week nett collection is 35 cr with a distributor share of 17 cr. Its lifetime collection will be 50 cr max with a share of around 25 cr. Addin non theatrical avenues, it will at best recover 45-50 cr which is just a 20-25% ROI. So much for Vishal Bharadwaj's genius that even his most commercially successful film ends up being just an AVERAGE grosser. Bang Bang on the other hand will nett 150 cr in India with a share of 80 cr and overseas it will gross 60 cr with a share of 25 cr. That makes a worldwide share of 105 cr and 60-70 cr have been recovered from non theatrical avenues making the total recovery to about 170 cr. Only a few individual distributors from Rajasthan and Central India will lose ,oney on BB while distributors of B/C centers will also lose on Haider which is a non starter at single screens.@Anup: in your numbers you are forgetting non theatrical revenues that are huge nowadays.  Especially bigger the movie, like BB, bigger the revenues.Haider is made on the same budget as 2 States & Ek Villain which went on to nett over a 100 cr at the domestic box office. Haider will end up with half the collections and be a losing to coverage equation for most of its distributors except the one's from NCR,Mumbai and Bangalore circuits who would make marginal profits. Haider will get an AVERAGE+ verdict at the box office. Bang Bang will be a loser for mass circuits like Rajasthan,Central India,UP and Gujarat while a plus equation for multiplex circuits like NCR,Punjab,Mumbai,Bangalore and Nizam. Overseas too Bang Bang is a plus equation for distributors and the film's final verdict is a SEMI HIT. For more updates stay tuned to www.bollywoodboxofficedata.blogspot.inQUEEN - Released in 850 screens; day 1 collection of 2 cr; week 1 18 cr; lifetime 60 cr; wom = 350%; ROI 100%+; only Hindi film since GADAR to have a higher second week collection then its first week collection, unbelievable, unheard of, outstanding trending in the multiplex era...the mother of all MULTIPLEX BLOCKBUSTERS even surpassing other multiplex cults like ZNMD and Kahaani which too had trending of over 100%. And people still harp about Haider being a multiplex hit with a trending score of 60% and an ROI of barely 20. Good joke!Fan - Thats a different thing,,,,there are so many benchmarks for calculating whether the movie was hit or flop or comes in any other catogory.....I was just saying that non of these two movies have bad luck on releasing on this date,,,,rather they both have taken advantage of this holiday season  ... any one of these teo movies have been released in any non festival season even being a solo release cant have earned so much......We have clearly seen preety much when big movies like Jai Ho or Holiday(Holiday was a better movie compared to Bang Bang) released in not so big dates have earned withing 120crores ..... And also m considering just the theatrical collection that too only domestic because i dont much data of other benchmarks......It's showing at our local cineplex in Syracuse, NY - and has an English-language trailer along with an American Distributor (Fox Searchlight, which releases mostly "art" films - heh). http://www.fandango.com/movie-trailer/bangbang-trailer/175287At least it doesn't have an English dub....@TimELiebe hey you never know...maybe it'd have added value with Katrina speaking in English. :PFinally, managed to watch it.I thoroughly enjoyed.  Having seen Knight and day several times the twists were all known.  The Hindi remake has remained quite loyal to the original, including the gags and punches. Only change made, and in my opinion thoroughly justified, was the replacimg of zephyr by diamond.  For rural areas connecting to a zephyr with infinite energy would have been quite difficult. Good action. Katrina is alright.  Hrithik is a Greek god. The role is tailor made for him.Will end up with a lifetime total of around 150 cr and a SEMI HIT verdict which is not bad at all considering the competition from Haider in the A centers and the fact that it released only 3500 screens. The factor that's stinged Bang Bang the most is the below par performance in the B & C centers and multiplexes of tier 2 cities. The film has recorded poor collections in Rajasthan,UP,Bihar,MP and Gujarat and its quite inexplicable since a similar Hrithik Roshan film called DHOOM-2 was an absolute rage and a record grosser in these very territories. If at all anyting, BANG BANG is an improved version of D-2 at least in terms of its outstanding stunts and action sequences. Yet again its been proved that audience taste just keeps varying from time to time and has no pattern whatsoever! The same audiences that made DHOOM-2 a record breaking blockbuster of its time have ended up damaging Bang Bang quite badly. Something similar happened recently with SRK's Jab Tak Hai Jaan and Salman's Jai Ho.@Anuj: Jab Tak Hai Jaan was mediocre.  Cannot compare it with other films.  The timing of the untimely death of YR was the only reason the film made some money( I am ignoring that the production house used monopolistic tactics).@Fan: If JTHJ was mediocre, then so was Veer Zaara which was a much bigger hit among the same audiences. In fact VZ was an absolute snoozefest to say the least. By the way, what do you hav to say about the D-2 vs BB analogy? Any guesses why BB underperformed in B/C centers despite being a superior action film compared to D2?maybe it'd have added value with Katrina speaking in English. :P  C'mon, Meetu! How bad is her Hindi, anyway...? I mean, I gather from all the jokes (including a few in the movies she's been in!) that she doesn't speak Hindi like a native - but does she have a slight accent like, say, Anil Kapoor in American and British movies, does? (That joke in TASHAN about his character wanting to speak "English - just like George W. Bush!" was extra-comical to us Americans, given Bush is a far from eloquent speaker, with a voice that sounds like a petulant Texan child! Anil Kapoor already speaks better English than Bush does....) An An-NULD thick accent that limits what she can play, and is kind of comical? Or is her accent so incomprehensible that she butchers the language the way Tommy Wiseau (who starred in and directed the cult anti classic THE ROOM) does, to the endless hilarity of his fans?Have you ever noticed, in most of her films, she has been given a "western" backstory? Its not incomprehensible, it is not like Anil Kapoor in English films, it just doesn't feel at home and she comes across as conscious about it.@Anuj because it is a boring film! :P@Meeta : Still a lot less boring and a lot more pulsating than crapfests like OSO,Chennai Express,Bodyguard,ETT and the upcoming Happy New Year! The comparison is with the Dhoom films and imo, Bang Bang is better & more entertaining than both D-2 & D-3. Its underperformance in the mass circuits is inexplicable.@Anuj: difficult for me to say why BB fared badly than D2. I am not sure that it did badly.  Probably because D2 was start of such slickly packaged action products.  Also BB, like Knight and day, had a different kind of humour than what non metro audiences might not enjoy. But most important reason as you put it, very difficult to predict audience moods.BTW whilst on mediocre yawn fests please add My name is ..., Chak de ..., Rab ne bana di....@Fan : U really think CDI is a yawn fest? For me its SRK's best thus far! I guess the biggest reason for Bang Bang's below par performance among the masses is its low key promotion which is quite shocking for a movie as expensive as this. Perhaps Fox Star Studios needed to take a leaf out of YRF's books.Have you ever noticed, in most of her films, she has been given a "western" backstory?Yes, I had, @Meetu, now that you mention it. Or ::snicker!:: a British one, like she had in Jab Tak Hai Jaan! (Even we could tell she couldn't do a "Received Pronunciation" accent to save her life!) As you might have gathered, her discomfort with Hindi doesn't come across to us as an English-speaking audience - what we get is her beautiful physicality, which might be why we like her more than a lot of Indian audiences do. FYI - part of our group, Bruce Coville, saw this while he was in India doing his "Global Kids' Writer" schtick a few weeks back, and came back to the US saying, "You All Got to See This! It's Everything We Love in Indian Movies!" So, um.... Guess we're watching it...?@TimELiebe oh dear...We all finally saw it, @Meetu - and as I expected, we really liked it for what it was. It was slam-bang action ride from start to finish, complete with ridiculously superhuman action scenes and almost as many twists and turns as the recent Agent Vinod - but a better story, which it freely admitted filching from the Tom Cruise-Cameron Diaz vehicle Knight and Day!We liked this version better, maybe because Hrithik Roshan doesn't have the same non-movie baggage Cruise does - or maybe he's just a more appealing action star. Katrina Kaif? She's great in the action and dance scenes, and can play intoxicated with love very well - but for the first time, I think I can understand why Indian audiences don't think much of her as an actress. There were some emotional beats later in the story where she didn't quite ring true - which is odd, as this isn't a movie where you'd think you'd need much acting to carry it off, so long as you can move convincingly. Is it me - or did the ending just beg for a limo to pull up in front of Our Heroes right before the end credits, and Dame Judi Dench as "'Mum' - Former Head of MI-6" to step out and try recruiting them for some global spy agency...? ;)@TimELiebe ha ha ha :DCopyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
