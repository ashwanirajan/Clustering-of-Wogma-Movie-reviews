Jai Gangaajal is an interesting web of actions, reactions and re-reactions between the usual suspects - people, police and politicians. Engaging even if not new, while you are there and awfully ordinary once you are out of the theater.A lot many things can get much more complicated if the gender of an honest police officer who takes on the system is female. And there in lies the trick. If the usual suspects like the villains' male ego taking a bigger hit, fear of rape and worse, come into play – it will be predictable. If they don't take that route, it will be shades of Singham, Dabangg Again, Rowdy Rathore - it will be predictable.What is the writer to do, then? Well, for now, the trailer suggests that they are happy what they were doing thus far. Here's a part of the audience there is some of the trademark Prakash Jha fire, even if we cannot see it in the trailer. 
    - meeta, a part of the audience
  Jai Gangaajal is what you expect it to be. The law-and-order-administration-politicians-businessmen nexus is out to get the powerless common man. Comes along a conscientious police officer who takes the nexus on. Except this once, the police officer is a woman. It is great to see that just because the officer is a woman, things don't change much. The men around her don't give her extra leeway nor do they take advantage. It is nice to see a woman treated like just another person. However, the film then has nothing too new to offer.Sure, the back and forth between the two sides is stronger in this film compared to the Singhams, Dabangg Agains, and Rowdy Rathores. However, it remains second fiddle to Gangaajal. Is that because it has a woman as the lead? I'd say no. It felt like it was more because she wasn't the only hero. It was nice to see the main protagonist and an actor of Priyanka Chopra's stature to give that much space to another character. Now, it might come across like a woman can't do her job without a man. However, I would go out on a limb and say, the job of taking on such ruthless and powerful people isn't one person's job. A team working towards one goal is relatively more believable compared to a one-man army. It also works well that the lady here is more like the inner voice of all the policemen in her force. However, would an male actor of this stature have agreeably played second fiddle? Would the lady herself have been okay had it not been the director of the film? Let's say these questions are outside the purview of the experience of the film. Then, I'd walk in with the understanding that it is about Bholenath Singh's (Prakash Jha) inner struggle and the lady police officer, Abha Mathur (Priyanka Chopra) is secondary in the story. Once you change that point of view, you have a very interesting story of a cold and ruthless police officer realising his precarious and dispensable position. Of course, you have to swallow the quick turn around. Yet, the well-developed remorse is not very common. And what a fine actor Prakash Jha is! He makes Bholenath's move from arrogance to brooding to soft-hearted believable despite its improbability. Unfortunately, so consumed he seems to have been with acting that he missed out on asking Priyanka Chopra to lose her model-like gait. When she is at one place though, she tries her best to make her voice sound authoritative. But then, she moves. And the model is back. Manav Kaul can now do a hot-headed politician in his sleep. Ninad Kamat as his brother though shines as the goon who's tantrums can put any two-year old to shame.There is another character in the film that is vying for your attention. All. The. Time. The background score. It is relentless. It is loud. It doesn't go with the film. There were a few scenes in the second half when it takes a break and they are beautiful. Those scenes made me want to see the film once again with the background track turned off. It wouldn't be a surprise, if the film becomes better manifold. As it stands though Jai Gangaajal engages you while you are in the theater – maybe making you a little fidgety towards the end because it is over 2.5 hours. But once you are out and think about it, if at all, you realise it is not too out of the ordinary. Except that you want to watch more of Prakash Jha as an actor.

        ...Jha does raise some token symbolic voices against farmer suicides and land mafia but it’s by no means a political film like his own Damul (1985). It’s a pure masala entertainer with vigilante justice by the masses as its main course. It does try to say that it’s hard to control the fire when the mob grows on rampage. It also rightfully points out that most often, police become mere spectators to such an outrage…

What sets the film apart is Jha's sure-footed storytelling (though he sticks to his tried-and-tested formula) and Priyanka Chopra's dazzling performance. This one straddles the two worlds of being a reasonably accomplished film as well as a crowd-pleaser. ...

Yet, Jai Gangaajal packs a punch with its panorama (a Badaun-like landscape where girls are hung from trees), dilemma and performances - particularly the one by 'Madam Sir', who wields a lathi you will love.

On a personal note, I would love to see him again in another project soon playing an interesting character, so you can sure watch the film once for the man alone.

Jha on the other hand, gets the bearing, accent, patois just right, giving his part a kind of aloof dignity that conveys that he has fallen into a cesspool, but is still somehow above it all. BN Singh is character to watch for, and Jha could make him/himself the hero of his next cop drama.

Its depiction of mob psychology is pretty good and characters such as B. N. Singh make it go beyond the predictability of the story. I think it could have gone far beyond this but I guess  getting a strong female character like Abha Mathur should satisfy my desire for the time being. Worth a watch.

: Jai Gangaajal Review: A swing and a Miss
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Prakash Jha has become predictable and boring to watch.  He does not seem to have a vision of his own anymore, tends to swing with the mood.His last hit, Rajneeti, was more because of the strong story inspired by Mahabharata - the best epic ever written.  And generous sprinkling of Godfather.  Otherwise that movie too would have fallen flat despite the presence of Devgn, Bajpai and Patekar.I do not expect any ground breaking stuff from this movie.  It will be a mix of many recent police flics, as observes Meetu.  Plus the female cop will give Jha extra freedom to throw in an attempted rape or even a real rape just to undermine the cop psychologically.First thing first. Jai Gangaajal is NOT a sequel to the 2003 Ajay Devgan starrer Gangajal. But the overall theme of the movie is somewhat similar. The main character in this film is also a police officer just like the earlier one. But this time it’s the turn of a lady cop played by none other than Priyanka Chopra.Makes me wonder if either Ms.Chopra did this as a lead-up to her starring role in the American television series Quantico (which has gotten a second season despite being more stupidly written than Insan - and less enjoyable, to boot!), or if she got cast as a result of starring in that show. Do you even get to see it in India?Yes @TimELiebe, we do get to see it in India. No idea which came first for Priyanka Chopra.@Meeta - I'm sorry, because Quantico is really insultingly stupid, and a waste of everybody's talents. At least Priyanka Chopra's getting well-paid to be in an idiotic American television series? And at least American audiences are getting to see an actual "Bollywood Movie Star" on television every week - and for once, she's not playing a terrorist or a socially awkward nerd?@TimELiebe Yes, there is a silver liningI really liked this movie..The song were also good..I just love Priyanka Chopra.Priyanka is a gift to bollywood industry that no other can fill.
