The entire film could be labeled a forgone conclusion. Not one single thing happens that you wouldn't have been able to tell from the trailer, if not from the title of the film. From the family problems, to the relationships, to the outcome of the grand championship. As typical, an underdog film, as it could get. Indians living abroad. Oh, what a rotten life they have! They have to make an identity for themselves, especially in a sport. So, what do they do? They make a team that has only Indians, naaah...these particular people are Punjabis, so they make a team of only Punjabis to fight the goras (Whites). Such is the convoluted interpretation of liberalism and/or nationalism.

Fine, I wasn't supposed to expect anything else from a film that calls itself Speedy Singhs. But, shouldn't there be at least a ghost of a story. Some conflict that will make me wonder what's to happen next. Let alone that, the conflict itself is predictable. 
So, then, we have stand-up comedian Russell Peters and chocolate boy Vinay Virmani to look forward to. Or not. Though, it is imperative to mention that I saw a dubbed version of the film, which means all the actors were speaking out translations of English dialogues in Hindi in the utmost ridiculous fashion, you know like Night at a Museum in Hindi. Yes, Rob Lowe too! Oh, how I felt for one of my favorite West Wing actors. 
The bhangra, the toilet jokes, and given there's Russell Peters, there are the racial, political incorrect humor too. None of it entertains or makes me laugh. It just felt like one of the films that make you go numb even if they are short.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.oops! Doesn't look like there's much to hang on to, is there?@Harpreet :) good point, I'll update the title so it reads (Hindi dub) Usually films are marked as dubbed in () on Bookmyshow. This one wasn't, I assumed this is the version it was meant to be seen in. Oh well...And no, "piss police" wouldn't have made me laugh even i'd seen it in English. I just don't get toilet humor. By the way, it was translated as "peshaab police"..ugggh...I don't believe I just typed that.@Aashkaran Ha ha ha. hard-nosed critic...ha ha ha. well, to each his own, i'd say.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
