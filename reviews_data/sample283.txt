Over-dramatized. Over-fictionalized. Over-commercialized. Too episodic. An inspiring story nevertheless.There is most likely only one kind of story where I don't mind commercial elements being added in the name of appealing to a bigger crowd - real life stories that ought to be known by every child in the country. I would rather it not be done, but if adding a touch of glamor is what it takes for my kids to take interest and be inspired by a hard-working lady boxer, then that's what it takes. It is interesting to see Omung Kumar, who has been art director to Sanjay Leela Bhansali films as director. Considering the film's texture doesn't look anything like a SLB film, Omung Kumar's style is intriguing. It looks raw and real. And so do the actors. For all the criticism lashed upon Priyanka Chopra, I think she has the skill to bring alive a character without reminding us of Priyanka Chopra. The trailer surely points to more of that from her, especially when she is playing the non-dramatized bits. Given the liberty of dramatizing the events, I am all set to watch Mary Kom take on the big screen. A story I want to hear. Just don't take me for granted please.Music Reviews:

  Yes, Mary Kom the film is much more dramatized and fictionalized than I had expected, but Mary Kom the character has so much grit that even if the real life Mary Kom is half as gutsy and strong-willed, she makes for a story that inspires. Unfortunately though that you have to do - discount a lot of the story. It's a shame that the makers didn't find the true story exciting enough and chose to spice events up for their convenience. I understand, some times that is what a commercial film needs, but it shouldn't be done to such an extent that you start questioning every episode you see on screen. So much so that, I came home to check the chronology of some events and was hugely disappointed with the way the timing of the climax (including the opponent Mary Kom plays) is changed around for filmy effect. I shouldn't be made to wait to get to Google to look up Mary Kom's life, I should want to be with the film for a long, long time. Then for a person who knows nothing about boxing, I wonder if the technicalities of boxing were shown appropriately. Without wanting to look it up (more because of disinterest rather than anything else) I am willing to place my money on boxing technicalities being totally ignored. It does look like an ill-researched project or worse, one where well-done research is intentionally disregarded.You then have the narrative itself. The screenplay is way too episodic almost like you are watching the film one short chapter after another. Almost as if to cover this drawback, the first half of the film even tries its hand at non-linear narration. Else, there is no particular reason to take us back and forth on the timeline.It is heartening though, that all these gaps in writing are sidelined by the best efforts of the cast. Priyanka Chopra and Darshan Kumaar are all equally earnest in their performances. At times, the dialogue help at others the filminess distracts but you cannot put the dialogue delivery at fault. This is despite the distracting make-up, colored and straightened hair, where none belonged. The actors make you root for the real-life people. If not for the blatant product placement, you would feel their pain with them too. While a husband's support for his wife's career, especially such a demanding one should be a given, not every one gets it. Less so, in small-town or rural India. I am happy that Mary Kom's husband, Onler's sacrifices and contribution received as much screen time as it did. This is an inspirational story of its own. And oh the irony of seeing sugar free, Iodex and Usha advertise their way into a film about one of the country's  athletes who in real-life struggled to find sponsors and financial support for most of her career. I guess we should just be thankful that there were no item numbers to make the film commercially appealing.So, would I take my kids to the theater to watch this one? Unlikely, will certainly not make extra effort. But would want them to watch it when it's on TV, just to see the power of strong will. Fortunately or unfortunately, it's not for the cinema, it's for the real-life person who deserved a film about her life. It is also interesting that a biopic has been made of a person whose career is still on. So for all you know, the story isn't over yet and we have the chance for an even more inspirational Mary Kom 2 at our hands, and hopefully a better film too.

          Mary Kom was good. could've been better, but you gotta appreciate the effort.
        
ShilotriAnkul:
          Mary Kom - The Film, good attempt, but lacks the punch. Not taking anything away from @priyankachopra though, she's done a fabulous job.
        
moviesteem:
          review: The film is watchable, but never great like it should've been http://t.co/WaO8dI5kXG MovieSteem http://t.co/NoxzdDnRGM #film
        
Kalmaniac:
          Mary Kom - The script, production values, direction don't make justice to Priyanka performance and the legendary boxer herself !
        
ArpitaPB:
          Mary Kom- A beautiful story, gripping performances, but a badly made film- writing to treatment.
        
shvetarajput:
          Mary Kom ..did not meet expectations.  A sucess story wasted ..cud have been better.  #failed
        
SandeepNaug:
          Omung Kumar should focus on more of ek minute type of shows. 120minutes is beyond his league. What a waste of time - Mary Kom MaryKom
        
pratikbhalgat:
          Mary Kom the movie, does not live up to the hype. Wish the story was not dramatized so much
        
NitinFern:
          I don't know why people are praising Priyanka Chopra for her acting in Mary Kom? She was soo mediocre, over-acting to the hilt.
        
neerajbhushan:
          'Chak De India' wasn't Hockey, but just Shahrukh Khan. Similarly, 'Mary Com" isn't Boxing...it's just Priyanka Chopra. #Bollywood
        
MaxPaite:
          Mary Kom movie is below my expectation... No manipur flavour at all.
        
khan9_bilal:
          Mary Kom is a sick movie

          There is so much more power and inspiration to the story of the wonderful Mary Kom than what is shown in the movie!

          Not impressed with Mary Kom.

          And you thought Mary Kom was a tribute to Mary Kom.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Mary Kom's biopicMary Kom's biopic
Priyanka Chopra as a school girl, though she almost walks away with it because of her performance, even if not her looks. 
Mary Kom's little brother wearing what looks like a good pair of jeans when they are complaining about not having enough money. 
Some of the coincidences - too dramatic and at the realm of unbelievable.
Priyanka Chopra doesn't show an ounce of new mommy weight. 
A lip-sync song! Really?
This section lists things that I think are not important to the overall impact of the movie. In most cases, it could be explained away by something like, “we noticed the glitch after the scene was shot and there were schedule/budget issues and thus we could not re-shoot it”. I like giving the makers the benefit of doubt, but I am amused nevertheless. Hopefully, they will tickle you too.
- Why did Mary Kom take a bus to go to the coach when she had reached the place earlier while chasing a guy she wanted to beat up. Maybe the school and the coach were in the same town, just left me a little disoriented for a bit. 
- How did she find her lost passport?
- How come a state level match was played between two states? Wouldn't state level matches be between two districts or clubs or something that is part of the same state?
- Ummm...you can tell a baby's temperature is close to normal by touching him. You don't have to really wait for the thermometer like you would for a home pregnancy test!

- An operation theater with a see through glass?After Bhaag milkha Bhaag expectations are from any Biopic coming in future....But Mary Kom is nowhere close to BMB....Major problems are 1.not so good choreography of boxing scenes , 2. the aggression what priyanka shows outside the boxing ring ,, she never shows it inside it.....3. a lot of unwanted songs and 4. its lenght.....Its too short for me,,,,i would have liked more detailing ,, i would like to know more about Mary Kom ,, its not upto the satisfactory amount....These all problem directs the finger to the director ,, he is inexperienced ,, and u can see it easily.....Leaving all the above things ,, its still a movie to watch ,, because its about our honour MARY KOM ,,, but there is no reason to rent it for big screen watch.....Its an opportunity lost ,, there could have been another BHAAG MILKHA BHAAGThanks for your informative review, although it gives a bit of the movie away. Going by your review, it seems that if there ever should be Mary Kom 2, you wouldn't want the same team (except the actors, maybe) to be involved in its making.Wanna watch it, but less inclined to go for it on the big screen.@Anup : Didn't get you. BMB was hardly a biopic and neither is MK. They're more of fictional plots "inspired" by real life events to a certain degree. Both films have been tweaked and moulded to cater to commercial sensibilities and fortunately, both films work quite well in their own respective domain. They might not be cinematic classics but they do serve the purpose of mixing inspiration with good old melodrama which Indian audiences thrive on. Both would be a 3.5/5 from my side.Fantastic initial. Hopefully the word of mouth will be positive enough for this film to become the highest grossing female lead film in recent times ahead of The Dirty Picture. In any case, even with mixed trending we can at least expect a box office performance at par with Kahaani/Queen.Anuj- Dont bother ,, i have simply written the points which i didnt liked about the movie,,,,dont know which one u r unable to understand because u havnt mentioned it....For Mary Kom is an opportunity lost ,, an average film ,, may be 3.25/5 ,, But BMB was the best movie of last year along with Madras Cafe to both of which i would give 4.5/5.....And please dont start your box office verdict ,, because these are my personal choices that too not according to box office collection ,, because i dont like movies as per there earning....Nice feel good patriotic film.I understand Anuj's point of view that to commercialize the film it's alright to spice up real life story.  But on this movie I am more in line with Meetu I.e. if you cannot find enough real awe inspiring and 56" chest moments from the life of a5 times world champion (at the time of going to press) and in a politically + bureaucratically  charged sports environment then you have really not done your basic research/homework. Adding too many fictional anecdotes puts a doubt into viewer's mind as to what part to believe.The movie length of just about 2 hours is perfect.A few attempts at comedy were lame with the oft repeated joke of feeding twice one of the twins and never the other one; and the bathing water being cold.Overall nice patriotic and power to women emotions mixed in with national integration message. PS: since the BMB conversation has started let me make my position clear. I found BMB an over hyped utterly boring and extremely long movie. In the hindi film fraternity where tu meri khuja aur mein teri khujau culture is rampant, the film was overhyped. Mary Kom is several times better.@Anup @Fan : I wonder how the 2 of you rate Paan Singh Tomar which was a lot more of a "biopic" in the true sense as compared to BMB & MK. @Fan : Perhaps 'coz Milkha Singh's life has been a lot more eventful and dramatic starting from his personal tragedy to his life as a dacoit to his girlfriends to him becoming a champion and hence packing all of that in in one film does take time!Strictly, by-the-numbers story which is ruined by the Bhansali penchant for soap. The boxing scenes are laughably bad and freckles or not, Priyanka tests our credibility as a Manipuri girl. The climactic ECG/Boxing countdown scene is milked till it parches, and makes no sense. I still found it marginally less boring than BMB, which for me was near-unwatchable.I so agree with your review and other comments below. Its an opportunity lost. I hate comparing movies (especially ones taking inspiration from real lives) but BMB was ultimately better researched. I got the feeling that with Mary Kom, the makers and PC were satisfied to showcase their hard work which is undeniable, but in the process lost focus on the bigger picture i.e. making people more aware about Mary Kom and her thought process other than some superficial level of strong will. I also think the angle about Manipur and the disassociation with the rest of country could have been explored a bit more (surely an interesting movie in itself). Also, the bit about Dingko Singh's victory inspiring Mary to pursue boxing and her impact now on other Manipuri youngsters. These are all points just touched upon in the movie and I would have loved if the makers would have explored these in more detail. I will wait for Mary Kom 2 which will hopefully end with a gold medal at Rio in 2016...My comment seems to have got lost in confusion!!Anuj- Paan Singh Tomar was definatly a brilliant movie.....with few negligible boring scenes in the second half ,, other wise it was great.....Direction: 1    Story: 1.5    Lead Actors: 1.5    Character Artists: 1    Dialogues: o.5    Screenplay: 1    Music Director: 1    Lyrics: 1@lost in confusion not really...same team, better research, less drama can work. @Suman wow..that bad huh?@Rachit yeah, as unfortunate as that is...@Samir I know quite a few people who didn't like Bhaag Milkha Bhaag at all. Quite interesting.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com. All rights reserved.(Credits: wogma logo by Ain Digytal Inc. wogma audio review signature tune by Shreyas Beltangdy.
