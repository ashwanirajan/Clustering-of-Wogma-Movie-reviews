A story that you must watch and the film is good too. A film based on a true life story is by default intriguing. Even if we take the 'true' of that phrase with a pinch of salt.   Such films have the advantage of not having to worry about being unpredictable. That could tip the balance of the film's acceptance by the audience on 'how' it plays out.The trailer doesn't raise any red flags except maybe it seems a tad dramatic. However, it feels like that is because of the way the trailer has been edited and hopefully the film will keep excessive drama at bay.Sonam Kapoor doesn't annoy immediately unlike in the trailer of her last film. And hey, we get to see Shekhar Ravjiani, even though it might be for a short while. Surprisingly, there are no music reviews out yet. Maybe, that is a good sign. The focus is on telling the story and not the marketing of it? Or rather the story is marketing itself.

  Finally, we have a story that absorbs us completely. It isn't a surprise then that it is not fiction, not something created by someone through their imagination. In fact, the story is what it is because it is true. It is heartening because such humanity is not 'just in the movies'. Would Neerja, the film have the same impact if the story weren't true? Difficult to say. However, the story would certainly have been forgotten by many if it weren't for the film. And, of course, the story could have been forgettable, if it wasn't told this well. It has been a long time since I heard applause by audience after the film ended and it has been a long time since I had tears well up and roll away because of a performance. Every time Shabana Azmi is on screen, I sensed a flood of emotion  that I haven't felt in a movie in ages. Her voice inflections through the film, not only in one particular scene, touch a chord. Not just her, you empathize with Yogendra Tiku as her husband, Neerja's father every time he is speechless  but is required to form words. And of course, Sonam Kapoor has vowed with keeping it restrained and real. A word here for the actors who play the terrorists, though I feel that even acknowledging the terrrorists' existence is giving them too much. Well, then that is how well the actors have done. Shekhar Ravjiani – even before we watched the film, we knew that we have to see this man in bigger roles on screen, didn't we? One could complain that the film could have been shorter making it crisper because after all it is almost two hours of being stuck in a plane. However, I would stop myself short while doing that, because it is about hijacked people who were stuck with terrorists in a plane for 16-17 hours. Remember we got breaks in the form of flashbacks. Other than that, sure, there is drama in the form of tight close-ups and use hand-held cameras. But it is not overdone. Maybe the Rajesh Khanna bit is a little over-the-top, here's hoping that Neerja Bhanot was really that big a fan. Aside from telling a story about the events of PAN AM 73, Neerja has a lovely layer of  woman empowerment sewed into the fabric of the film. This is not just about the woman's grit because she is a woman. But also about being wanted as a girl child, about her independent spirit and about her having to stand-up against labels and what was wrong. Not because she is a woman, but because she is human. And that is what is so enabling about the film's subtext. Indeed, you feel like standing up to salute her parents who instilled the values that she lived and died by. Goodness forbid then, were we to find ourselves in a situation like this, will be remember this film and act accordingly? Even if a handful of us do and fewer stay as brave, we would have made Neerja's short life larger.

        ...It is a good thing this team chose to buck the trend, because Neerja Bhanot’s is a story worth telling and this film tells it really well. It is as if Ram Madhvani was there on that flight with Saiwyn, Sonam and the rest of them that day in 1986. It is as if Neerja’s soul resides in the film and whispers at us from the screen in those final moments. It is as if we too were there. For a filmmaker to stir up such a high degree of emotion while making no obvious attempt to manipulate us is an amazing achievement. Neerja is outstanding.

But then ending on a lighter, positive note, would like to share the few words said by Neerja’s real mother to Sonam when she went to meet the lady as the lead actress.

It is a film that will make you stand up for what's genuinely Right without bothering about nationality, religion, sex, cast or colour of the skin. Most importantly as a movie watching experience, you'll be glued to the movie screen with tears and admiration welling up in your eyes. NEERJA is a movie that will make you a better person.

Why did it take so long for Bollywood to pay tribute to Neerja Bhanot?

That heroes need not be worshipped, but they need to be thanked. That just a little bit of kindness goes a long way.

But you'll also have to comprehend her steeling up to the responsibility her daughter's sacrifice entails for her - of staying strong and spreading the inspiration.

Also you wish the film were tighter and crisper, particularly in the second half. The feeling that you’re being manipulated – rather than feeling genuinely invested in what’s going on – pops up a few times too. But these are minor complaints in what is evidently a well-intentioned, heartfelt film that pays tribute to a real hero.

As she tries convincing herself that nothing could happen to her daughter, as she gives a heartbreaking tribute to her daughter, as she looks at her daughter's body for the last time, Azmi makes sure you are left moist-eyed throughout....

Madhwani has not focused only on the hijack drama, but has also offered glimpses of Neerja's personal life, which makes the narrative more relatable. The section of the film once the plane is hijacked is taut, thrilling and terrific and will keep you hooked to the screen. The narrative unfolds so superbly that you end up rooting for Neerja's life, despite the knowledge of her death. The realistic way the film has been shot and presented too works in its favour as there are no unnecessary scenes or over-the-top dialogues or cringe-worthy melodrama.

It might be asking too much in a film about Bhanot to make her killers fleshed-out characters, but the film might have gained in depth had it at least revealed a little about the terrorists’ motivations and aims (Captain Phillips, for example, gives us a glimpse of the pirates’ lives). Without the context, the hijackers are just another bunch of crazed, bearded, armed men shouting in Arabic—a stereotype Indian cinema seems to fall back on as readily as Hollywood.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Looking forward to watch this brilliant movirA tale well narrated and a story that deserves a watch! Neerja is a powerful tale of human spirit and sacrifice that every movie goes must watch.bestI appreciated this movie. Sonam Kapoor kept it real and was fantastic in Neerja. The role suited her quite well. And the movie has some special moments that remain sweet.Biopics and real life events are the current Bollywood fad, what with Talvar, Airlift, Neerja,  Dhoni, Azhar, etc.Whether they be nationalistic subjects that unite people  (Airlift, Neerja ) or personality based subjects that divide people  (Talvar, Azhar, ...) they all have one thing in common - extreme cinematic licence / liberty to portray the subject as epitome of good quality and to portray the antagonist as the Satan himself.  Unfortunately in real life there are no clear black or white but hundreds of shades of grey. And Bollywood directors have to accept this fact and learn to handle this fact cinematically. Neerja, a good story and film, also suffers from this crystal clear black and white portrayals of character, which are nothing more than some liberties taken by the director. Remove them and you would have had a brilliant diamond.Performance wise the film is elevated several levels by the two ladies.  Sonam Kapoor is the most natural fit for a young bubbly upper middle class girl. Shabana Azmi gives yet another powerful performance.The execution of the film is quite crispy. Director comes quickly to the main plot. And manages to keep the story on track and thereby keeping the audience involved.  Good film. Could have been better.PS: I am not sure if Neerja Bhanot was really a Rajesh Khanna superfan or it was also a fictional adaptation of the director. Because for a 1963 born and brought up in Bombay by around the year 1986 the only superstar would have been Amitabh Bachchan; as confirmed by the character Imraan the radio mechanic.@Fan My birth year is 1974 and I am still an Amitabh Bachchan fan :|Currently i not watch this movie but i read about this movie, i hope this movie have a good story.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
