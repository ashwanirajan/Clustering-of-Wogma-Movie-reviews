
wogma rating: Beg or borrow, but do watch (?)
A warm film about a mundane arranged marriage. One you can watch again despite convenient climax. Do you fall in love and get married or get married and then learn to love? What if you learn to hate instead of learn to love? What if the whole thing starts in one's resentment towards the other for no fault of the others? What's new about it anyway? Not in India, anyway. What makes Dum Laga Ke Haisha such a warm film, then? A film which has characters that wear their weaknesses on their sleeves to make the film charmingly close to real life – save for the climax, of course. Prem aka Lappu (Ayushmann Khurrana) has been no good at academics and loves Kumar Sanu. He is pretty much considered good for nothing by all around and in return is cynical about the world around. Sandhya (Bhumi Pednekar) is educated, mature and is submissive but won't take nonsense lying down either. She's a woman's woman who has no self-worth issues. She is also not the conventional definition of good-looking either. And therein lies the crux of the conflict in the film. With very little to go on, other than gut-feel an arranged marriage relies a whole lot on how the other person looks. And Prem gets pressurized into marrying someone who he doesn't like at first look. So, why does he get married at all? Well, he is considered a good for nothing, remember? And what voice does a suppressed lad have when he has achieved little in life, right?That there is a pointer at the scores of social dynamics in an arranged marriage – pressure, gut, looks, submissiveness and so on. Dum Laga Ke Haisha has captured it all so well and in just the right measure to not make it dramatic and yet keeping you completely engrossed. Sure, it falls into the historic, cop-out trap of both a quick, convenient finish and dramatizing the events. But it tries. It tries with the right ingredients that work well – conversations in a relationship. Unfortunately, there aren't enough of them to make events believable. I understand, there is always the risk of too many conversations and the danger of the run-time slipping across the two-hour zone. But, the balancing act left a little something lacking. Fortunately, it wasn't the performances. Of course, no film about ordinary domestic squabbles can manage to create warmth without ace acting by all involved. And that is exactly what Dum Laga Ke Haisha has. From the lead roles to the ones on the side you know which one is likely to behave in what sort of a way in the given situation. The bitterness, the selfishness, the momentary pleasure and the pain all come through.Yet, Dum Laga Ke Haisha is not a very serious film. Sure, it addresses a social flaw and how the people that make the same society are coping with it. At the same time it isn't too satirical or dark. It brings a smile because the characters have their quirks and keeps you interested because the characters are like you and me, only with different quirks. What else can one ask from a film that aims to do exactly that! And this once I mean that in a nice way.

        ...If you want to relive the times when life was much simpler, then Dum Laga ke Haisha is the movie for you. Packed with some wonderful performances by the entire cast, the film tells a sweet story, with plenty of comic punches to keep you entertained. Watch it for Bhumi Pednekar who has shown great promise. In closing, I would like to say, go watch Dum Laga ke Haisha with no expectations and more often than not you would  leave the theatre with a faint smile lingering on your face....

Reason being, the story doesn’t really require that much music, but when that music plays in DLKH, it creates the perfect mood. This film is based in the ’90s, it even has a cameo by Kumar Sanu. And that treatment for this story is perfectly novel. A lot of thought and effort has been put into making this film. You’ll appreciate the seamless intertwining of humour and drama. And acting performances that are phenomenal....

In today's India, with airbrushed photos and teen depression due to skewed body images, this film sends out a brave message by casting a beautiful, appealing, plus-size heroine. Sandhya is vibrant and happy, comfortable with her sexuality, and speaks her mind. The audience is reminded of the lyrics from one of the songs - "ordinary nahin, deluxe dhoondenge". Full marks to the makers for correcting our vocabulary and proving that "fat" is actually "deluxe"....

          Dum laga ke haisha - nice attempt. What killed it is the audience's laughter at all wrong moments. Insensitivity intact.

: Nice story and star cast..
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Sanjay Misra and Seema Pahwa are enough to make a movie interesting...looking forward to watch this movie.My pick for the week was Ab Tak Chappan 2 , unfortunately which came out as a bad movie.Dont know wether i will go for another one or not this week..Although reviews for this one are pretty good(shockingly)..Even reviewers are considering this as a comeback of YRF..Seems to be an interesting movie.Planning to watch it on Sunday.@Rohit @Swati did you watch it?@Anup you might want to give it a shot.Hi Watched it on Sunday.Really an awesome movie, enjoyed it.@swati yay! :DDirection: 4    Story: 3.5    Lead Actors: 4    Character Artists: 2.5    Dialogues: 3.5    Screenplay: 3    Music Director: 1    Lyrics: 2Would have loved a different climax [comment partially deleted because it gives the movie away]Hats off.Gem of a film. As the story unwinds it sucks you into it making you live every moment of the film with the characters.  You feel the pain that Sandhya feels on her insult. At the same time one empathises with Prem's predicament. You end up yearning for the happy ending. And the contrived convenient filmy ending is ignored in the process. Throughout the film I had this nagging feeling of having watched a similar sub plot in a 1970s film; the film Piya ka Ghar coming in mind. Similarities apart Dum Lagake is an excellent watch.@Fan now that you mention it, yeah...it has glimpses of Piya Ka Ghar. :DA small gem of a film elevated by superb performances!Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
