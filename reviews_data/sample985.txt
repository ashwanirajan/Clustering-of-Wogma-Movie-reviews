
wogma rating: Beg or borrow, but do watch (?)
The word spells gloom, the vision it creates makes a shiver run down the spine. The things you've read about this thing called prison invoke the worst of your imagination. The Neil-Madhur combination brings this harshness to life.A Jail - the subject matter is so grim that the treatment can only be depressing. You see a few characters but it’s the jail that adds, deletes and depletes what had defined them thus far. Parag (Niel Nitin Mukesh) is the one you care for, you want him to get out of this jail. And while doing that, you are sucked in; in to the atmosphere, living one day at a time - sometimes hopeful, some days aimless. And you want to avoid acknowledging that creepy feeling - real life prisons must only be worse. And this is because Parag turns narrator and you see this essay through his eyes. The plot moves on only because life does.

What is shown is mostly what we know already. And yet we must have seen only a small percentage of what really goes on in those barracks. We don't see the boredom a prisoner must have gone through. Why should we care? They are the ones who have defecated society. We have to live in their fear. They might as well rot here to the fullest before they are sent to hell. But then, there are also the ones who repent, the one-time offenders, and … the innocent - yet to be put on trial or worse - proven guilty. 
You also are introduced to the other inmates of these jails - the policemen in-charge. What a thankless job that is!? What crime did they commit to be forced to spend their days and nights with the worst that humanity offers?  Let alone the day-to-day problems they face from the higher ups, the judicial system, the politicians and their own family. 
Yes, Madhur Bhandarkar has taken upon himself to sensitize his audience to the plight of the people who live in a world we know exists and choose to ignore. He does so in a matter-of-fact tone. He doesn't sermonize, he doesn't glamorize. He just opens the door and ironically lets it be so. 
Writer Madhur, has chosen one representative for each set of people that constitute an Indian jail. He doesn't necessarily fill in the flesh in detail, but there's enough for us to make a fair judgment about the characters. Parag doesn't say much. But even if you don’t take into account the acting skills used, there's a lot in the writing that tells you about him. There are other characters narrating similar feelings and you know what he's thinking. It is extremely well-woven into the narrative. 
There is actually only one main character in the film. And it's risky - banking on just one actor, not even a lady lead to stride alongside. The bet worked. You don't miss more detailed characters. His misery, his hope are enough to agonize you through the 2 hours. Manoj Bajpai is only a bonus. The two show what silence can convey. 
The plot cannot be broken down into an introduction, a conflict, and a climax. The first and last parts are way too short. In fact the climax seems too simple and quick. The pace suddenly changes and it ends almost abruptly. But, even so, there's no preaching, there's no epilogue. And that must have been a difficult-to-resist temptation.
This is an autobiography of a prison. Not one prisoner or two. But it’s a peek into a few years of a jail's life. Inmates come and inmates go. You see it, you smell it, you sense it. Parag's misfortune - of being at the wrong place, at the wrong time, with the wrong person - is only incidental. But you will be thinking constantly of the people he represents - the innocent.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Parag (Neil Nitin Mukesh) is wrongly accused of a crime he hasn't committed. His life in prison is what we are about to see.Parag (Neil Nitin Mukesh) is wrongly accused of a crime he hasn't committed. His life in prison is what we are about to see.
Mugdha Godse's make-up and look as the movie progresses.
The overall absence of words to convey feelings.
The entire nicotine-coat look given to the jail.
The irony that the registration in a jail seems so similar to checking into a hotel. One's to curb freedom and the other is to enjoy it. 
The first sequence - its not gory but its intense. You desperately want it to end, even if it means that you are getting into a predictable flashback.
The economics and politics within a prison.
The cricket bookies comment that the match decisions in cricket are more instantaneous as compared to volley ball!

Mugdha Godse's acting as a chirpy girl in the beginning.
Awful choreography.
Completely forgettable songs.
The fact that the woman suddenly wears salwar suits now that calamity has struck. Really? Is that all a woman would think - these are bad times, let me wear Indian!
Joe D'Souza's tattoo. Badly sketched!

Why weren't drivers and passengers wearing seatbelts while driving in a car!
I see you have detailed ratings but no overall ratings. It good if you include overall ratings or verdict for the movie.I saw azab prem ... and then read that Jail has a better review @wogma. But I feel after all considerations Katreena might make the difference for me :DThis is a good movie to watchCopyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.

Parental Guidance:


Violence: In general, the environment of the jail is pretty violent even if there is not violence shown. In addition, this has some gun fights and beating up, torture scenes.
Language: More or less clean, though murder and killing is indicated through language used.
Nudity & Sexual content: A bar song, indication of masturbation and oral sex. 
Concept: Life in a prison. W character who's a bar dancer by profession, extra-marital affair, 
General Look and Feel: Its dark and grim. I'd keep the kids away for this reason and lots more.
