
wogma rating: Watch if you have nothing better to do (?) - when you are in a giggly-chirpy kind-of a mood.
    
  Tere Naal Love Ho Gaya is loud. Very Loud. Yet if you are in that giggly/exuberant mood can be an enjoyable 'nothing better to do' watch.Looks like Valentine's Day is extending its stay in Bollywood. Another rom-com. Another exuberant woman pairing up with a timid man. 
Though I admit, if there is anyone who can play a cheery-chirpy character, it is Genelia. It just seems so effortless for her and of course, Kareena Kapoor or Preity Zinta. Anyway, while sure, Tere Naal Love Ho Gaya looks like it has potential to be fun, it also gives a great sense of having nothing else, in terms of story. 
  
There is no intrigue created by the trailer in terms of the conflict that the lead pair will face. In a way, it's good. Because we don't know too much of what the film is about. But, my worry is that the film might not be about anything at all. Plus it promises to be loud, in addition to the Punjabi flavor in the title itself. 
Interestingly, the YouTube channel  barely has anything other than the one theatrical promo. No other marketing material at all. I wonder whether I should be thankful that they aren't overdoing the marketing which seems to be the trend today or should I be skeptical of the film itself.
So, I say, Tere Naal Love Ho Gaya will be easy-come-easy-go and a few laughs while its around. More like a wedding-cum-valentine gift from the real life couple to themselves.
Music Reviews:
Milliblog - "While the soundtrack gets the best out of Atif and Mohit, it’s not representative of Sachin Jigar’s current form."
Music Aloud - "7/10"
Bollyspice - "3/5"
dunkdaft - "Composer duo Sachin-Jigar who gave some commendable tracks in 2011, starts off 2012 in a pretty mixed mode."

  The moment characters in a film begin reacting to everything by yelling at the top of their voices, I'm put off. Invariably, there is insistent background music as accompaniment too. Tere Naal Love Ho Gaya hits that nail on the spot. That besides, there is nothing much going for it in terms of story or logic.

Well, there is nothing logical about a strong-headed woman who has her own mind and knows what she wants not being able to avoid marriage till she finds the right guy. At that very basic level, Tere Naal Love Ho Gaya fails. But, I guess, you could give it to them, at what they were trying to do by the end. It's miraculous how the entire film seems to revolve around Minnie (Genelia D'Souza (Deshmukh(?))) and yet it ultimately is up to the man of the film, Viren (Riteish Deshmukh) to show who wears the pants. 
Of course, the climax is something we should have given up on, after the first time it was used in a film. But, oh well, all is fair in love, war and Bolly-com - is what the audience has to come to terms with. 
The only thing going for the film then, is the lead pair - Riteish Deshmukh and Genelia D'Souza. Genelia D'Souza is no doubt very pretty and one could just alternate between her glinting eyes and charming smile for a couple of hours. You'd enjoy it even more if you are not distracted by her exaggerated hand-gestures and shrill voice, like me. And if you actually like that kind of body language and dialogue delivery, I wouldn't even venture into how much it'd mean to you. But, I tire easily of over-enthusiastic characters, in real life too, and we've seen too much of those in recent times, anyway. 
Riteish Deshmukh on the other hand plays the perfect lad-in-distress - helpless, clueless yet surprisingly sure of what he wants in life. Yet, many a time, you just want him to act normal and see if that works for you. The rest of the cast is a loud bunch, which is why the 2-3 glimpses of subtle understanding that you see from Om Puri come as a surprise. They remind you of what he is capable of. 
Unfortunately, Tere Naal Love Ho Gaya is so caught up in being exuberant and funny that it does injustice to the 'message' that it wants to send. Even so, when the underlying motivation does come across, it is a pleasant surprise and you wish you had more. 
That was my problem with Tere Naal Love Ho Gaya. It tried too hard to keep that smile on my face. Fine, I did enjoy a few moments, but then there were others that got annoying. And, anyway, ultimately the boy-meets-girl story had no other meat in it.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.We enjoyed this one, Meetu - the story's silly as masala tends to be, but the dance numbers were fun, the songs were enjoyable, and real-life couple Riteish Deshmukh and Genelia D'Souza have great chemistry that sells the love story. Most of us also loved Ms. D'Souza's willingness to go broad and silly, though my wife may have muttered "Magic Pixie Dream Girl" at some point in her performance!The twist right after the Interval actually kicked the story up a notch or two for us - and while the a'hole fiancé was a bit too lazy and shiftless (to say nothing of he and his bhais graduating with honors from The Imperial Stormtrooper Marksmanship Academy!) , that still resulted in a lot of comic action sequences. We enjoyed it as a Sunday night diversion - you won't be surprised to hear Netflix's recommendation for what we'd like to see next was MERE BROTHER KI DULHAN!@TimELiebe ha ha ha ha ha...not surprised at all! :PCopyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
