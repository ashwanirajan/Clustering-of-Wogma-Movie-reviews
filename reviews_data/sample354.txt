A girl-meets-boy story with a difference. A girl-meets-boy story which works despite typical moments that qualify a film as a romantic comedy. We have another round of romcoms on our cards in the coming few weeks. Starting with One by Two, to be followed by next week's release Hasee Toh Phasee. As most other romcoms appear in their trailers, this one too looks fresh and out there with its craziness. Parineeti Chopra seems perfect for the completely zany character she is playing. But, my worry is the same that I have for all films which have hilarious dialogue in the promos - that is all there is. The movie will just be sewing those moments together. Hopefully, it won't happen here. There is hope at the hands of vinil Matthew, because I've loved some of the ads that he has directed. Hasee Toh Phasee does have a very similar texture. Hope it has the same slight hand in the writing too.On the other hand, given Parineeti Chopra's character, I don't quite get what the title of the film is all about. She doesn't remotely look like a person who can't look through a guy's intentions. I hope the title will be the only quibble I have against the film. Music Reviews:

  And some times, love doesn't happen at first sight, unlike most films would have us believe. Or love doesn't necessarily follow intense animosity. Some times, you get to know a person and then you acknowledge the attraction you felt towards them. And some times, the film tries this stunt and it works even though it falls into the typical trappings of romantic comedies every once in a while. Given that this genre is done to death, it is the characters and the moments chosen to drive the story forward that have to do all the hard work. The characters have to make themselves interesting with their gray shades and humanness and at the same time make us root for them. The situations have to present themselves in a novel way without seeming totally out of the box. Hasee Toh Phasee succeeds on both counts, to a large extent. Meeta (Parineeti Chopra) is a zany character that is immediately likable. She is overtly quirky and yet given Parineeti's skills she makes you overlook her craziness as "possible". It's not that Parineeti Chopra outdoes herself or has given a marvelous performance. Neither has she under-played the part. She just does her thing and convinces us to be with Meeta, for Meeta.Nikhil (Siddharth Malhotra) too is interesting because he is so plain. You don't see such characters in films who are your regular John Doe and yet can keep you interested in how his life goes about. In fact, it is his simple-mindedness that charms you. That and the glimpse of craziness that is stifled by the "system".Parineeti and Siddharth play it well together too. From the indifference to the neutral to the confused to the smitten - they convince you through the steps of falling in love. It is the side characters that leave you unconvinced. All but Manoj Joshi overact and make the act borderline slapsticky. And therein lie the traps that Hasee Toh Phasee falls prey to. There are a few cliché situations that it finds itself in. But, the point to note here is that the film is set in the middle of a wedding and it is a Karan Johar production and yet things stay more-or-less non-masala. That is the director and writer's victory. It is refreshing to watch something different being attempted in as rundown a genre as rom-com. It is refreshing to see the lead female protagonist get something real to do - maybe the technicalities are all over the place but at least she isn't one of the two extremes tomboy/chirpy-bubbly or demure/shyness incarnate. It is a little disappointing to see her too, make her life about her man. But, then again, maybe that is what love does to you.

: Didn't Like it QUITE as Much as Meetu Did - But Still Very Good
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.I am interested in watching this because of Parineeti and the Song Zehnaseeb but only after @Meetu reviewed it.It gives something refreshing  in the regular genre of bollywood,,,,the story is kept simple but the screenplay is interesting with good support in acting and dialogue(being simple with soft humour).......Parineeti is the best actress in bollywood among the bewcomers,,,,and she nailed it again,,,,shiddhart is a good actor too,,,,its really difficult to show good acting in simple characters and he did it nicely,,,,,,although he needs to improve his dancing skills.......Over all its entertaining leaving some melo dramatic scenes with uncle slapping parineeti and mom saying ’door hoza meri nazaron se’........Its easily a good watch in big screen....All time blockbusters of 2013  Himmatwala and Besharam.  Disasters of 2013  Dhoom 3 and Chennai Express.Looks like a clean movie, Why then the tag line Cucking Frazy? Does Anurag Kashyap need to appear witty at all times. Sic of these Pseudo intellectuals.@PB - First Watch movie dude ...... That tag line was given for the character of Parineeti and crazyness she does......And the prblms she creats due to her lack of self awareness....@PB:Do u chaps have a fetish for targeting Anurag Kashyap as soon as you hear his name associated with a project? He's only an associate producer and has no other role to play in the film's creative aspects! Amusing that u guys have never mentioned Karan Johar's name in the same sentence as a pseudo intellectual (despite being the chief producer of both HTP and Lunchbox) 'coz not only is that film-maker a pseudo but he makes the kinda movies that can give any sane soul a migrain (i do not consider SRK fans dancing to Bole Chudiyan & Mahi Ve as sane souls). Anurag might not be that rich but at least he does not make sleep inducing shaadi baraat nonsense and nor do his minimal cost films make significant loss for anyone concerned! PS:Losses suffered by Ra.1 and Gori Tere Pyaar Mein would be equal to the production cost of all Anurag Kashyap directorial ventures taken together. Lemme not even get into Omkara,Guzaarish,Saawariya and Saat Khoon Maaf by the forever pseudos VB and SLB who burn huge holes in the pockets of their investors with almost every movie of theirs'.Direction: 3    Story: 3    Lead Actors: 3.5    Character Artists: 3    Dialogues: 3    Screenplay: 2.5    Music Director: 1    Lyrics: 1@Meeta you did not review Heartless is it that you only review one film per week.@Siddharth I usually try to do 2 reviews in the week, if there are more than one releases. But, this week, I had some really important thing to attend to, so did only one.Music Director: 3.5Lyrics: 2.5@Suman oh you changed the ratings?@Meetu: We watched this a couple weeks back - and while it was bit clunkier to us than it was to you, we generally liked it. I guess our biggest issue was we couldn't quite figure out if Nikhil was just a charming con man though most of the movie, or genuinely trying his best and having circumstances throw his life in disarray - far as I can figure, it seems it was both! It was interesting to see an Indian movie with a character clearly meant to be a high-functioning Autistic, as it was obvious Meeta (did you like her name? ;) ) was. It took us a while to realize that's what she was playing, and though a bit gimmicky The Younger Ms. Chopra did a really good job of it, making the character both quirky and a bit sad. Once it became clear what she was, her odd character tics (mainly, the disconnect between her taking what she needed when she needed it and how that would affect others) made much more sense. It played like the writers had either known actual High-Functioning Autistics, or had done their research well on it - and wanted the audience to understand what it was like for somebody like her.
