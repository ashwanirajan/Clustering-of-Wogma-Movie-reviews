As boring a narrative as it could get.A story that is all over the place and has one too many a convenient sub-plots. A narrative that is in a constant state of exposition – a voiceover of the hero, Raghu (Himesh Resammiya) tells you what hero is doing while it is happening on screen. Let alone “show, don't tell”, this seems clearly to circumvent the need for the hero to act. As ironical as it is, that Himesh Reshammiya takes himself so seriously is mighty amusing. He has this intense look which works well when there is a need to be intense, but the rest of the time it is just funny. It is like his character is expecting doom. All. The. Time. Even while he is falling in love, he looks like he is readying himself to mourn for the break-up. Farah Karimaee would need to start from the basics if she wants to act in more films – like say, dialogue delivery. Here it is not too bad because, she is required to play prop. What else can you make of a song that has her change into skimpier clothes with every eighth beat? This when the rest of the people on the streets of Dublin she is walking on, are covered head-to-toe to counter winter. That is the attitude of this film towards film-making - over-styling, over-acting, over-exposing; under-writing, under-directing, under-wanting-to-make-a-film. Truly, Teraa Surroor feels like a film that was made with the sole intention of adding to work experience in LinkedIn profiles of everyone who was involved with the film.The interesting bit is that if you sit back and try to summarize the story of the film, it is not too bad. With a little more work on making it real, it could have been a half-decent film. But see, that was not what they were aiming for – a watchable film.

The pragmatic economics (cost recovery through the sale of music, satellite and other rights), no opposition and the multitude of Himesh Reshammiya's fans will ensure it will sail to safety at the Box Office.

They can both take heart from their co-star, whose career is testament to the fact that success in Bollywood often has little to do with talent and everything to do with self-deluding confidence. This is Reshammiya’s one true achievement. He believed he was a star so fervently that everyone else ended up believing it too.

No readers have rated this movie yet.This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.I think no one expects anything better from Reshammiya. God knows why he is so popularxxwww.aparnamudi.comI never liked HR, neither as a singer, nor as a music director and worse still as an actor.  Although once in a while his music is good - but I find it more an exception than the rule.Nevertheless, purely from business point of view (ROI), this movie is going to make huge profits for the production team.  Keep in mind that revenues come from music rights, satellite rights, etc.  And every paisa counts.  On the expense side, it should be one of the most frugally produced films.  And so overall (bottom line) the film will make more money than it took to make it.  And the lesser the production costs, the greater the profit margins.  Way to go Himesh.@Aparna :)@Fan Other than the location, the rest of the film does look frugal :)Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
