wogma rating: The keen should rent; else TV/online (?)
As good as any other inspirational story. Spirited and heart-warming performances make Hawaa Hawaai stand out.You have an innocent looking child. He is poor. He has to work hard. And then you see a gleam in his eye for something unreachable. What's there not to like about stories like these? Especially when there are reasonably decent performances. Hawaa Hawaai is yet another story that inspires to reach out for your passion. At the same time, It attempts at sensitizing you to the issues of child labour in Mumbai slums - which is nice, even if a little too in-the-face. It is yet another story that you can watch. The only problem is the words "yet another".Hawaa Hawaai's story has a very "been there, seen that" feeling about it. The melodrama doesn't help its case. And then it has a preachy undertone, which borderline beats its own purpose. The good thing is, every time it goes into one of these zones, it manages to get back on track pretty quickly. In fact, it even makes some points rather subtly, in contrast to its own style thus far. The writing is very simple. The story doesn't dig deep into its characters, nor does it even try to create too many ups and downs. In fact, the first down that our protagonist Arjun aka Raju (Partho Gupte) sees came way after I thought, "isn't this all happening too easily for him?" The beauty is that you don't mind things working out easily for Arjun. His character and situation has been built up such that it'd be wrong of you not to sympathize with his condition instantaneously. Yes, the film is  pretty judgmental about its audience. It wants to educate. It wants to sensitize. All very noble, except that it gets patronizing every once in a while. Fortunately, the combined effort of the actors, doesn't allow the patronizing to become overwhelming. Partho Gupte's earnest performance; Saqib Salim's enthusiastic one; and the knowing irony that the four kids in Arjun's gang bring out together don't allow you to get bogged down with the overt effort to sensitize.I also found myself intermittently tuning off the lyrics to the songs playing in the background. One, there were way too many of them. Two, the music wasn't too great. Three, the lyrics are predictable. In any case, will I take my kids to watch this one? Yes, for sure. And hopefully, that will contribute to efforts in inspiring some form of social responsibility in them. That - Hawaa Hawaai might be perfect for.

          Saw Hawa Hawai. Super film. Amole Gupte has an awesome ability to make good movies with children at the focus. Highly recommend it!

          Hawa hawai is a really nice movie. Amol Gupte made it a bit commercial but lovely movie nonetheless. Must Watch!

          Hawa Hawai is an exceptionally well made sports based movie, reminds you of Chak De India in certain scenes with the same feeling of pride.
        
anurag_jhalaria:
          Hawa Hawai: A simple movie made with great determination. Amol Gupte is a genius and his son Parthi is a sheer talent. Go & get motivated!!

          Hawaa Hawaai   What a brilliant film.
        
Varsha1901:
          Hawa Hawaai's first half was fantastic but second half was slow. Gupte packed in all the melodrama formula possible!The kids were brilliant.
        
Bhaskar8883:
          central roles dont hv effective dialogues. Hawaa hawai needed better scripting/dialogues. Other kids rock & have most funny punch lines

          Hawa Hawai : Nice subject, but this time Amol Gupte flawed - stereotyped father-death sequence was unpleasant. Though Partho, kids rocks!!
        
Boeing0777:
          This Hawa Hawai is super boring !
        
aishasharma25:
          Also saw hawa hawai ..partho Gupte is quite good and his coach the biggest eye sore about the film ...!! All in all overhyped ..

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.The question is - Will this film make money? As, such films need to.Even though we keep praising films which don't ride on the "RICH & FAMOUS" actors/directors/producers and are well-attempted, or even, at times, well-made, it still remains a fact that "BOGUS & MINDLESS" films led by Bollywood stars (read ShaRK, SalaMAN) keep joining the 100/200/500-crore club. Such a shame!!Hi Meetu!I am from Bangladesh. I am biiiiiiig fan of yours. I have been following wogma for years. I am looking forward for your review on the upcoming movie 'children of war' which is based on 1971. haven't found the movie's name under wogma's 'coming soon' list. Aren't you gonna review this?@moviebhakt Well, it is what it is. I am just glad that the films are being made. @wogmafan Hey! I couldn't watch the film for various reasons, but Pradeep did and he reviewed it here - http://wogma.com/movie/children-war-review/Thanks!Yet another sincere heartwarming attempt from Amol Gupte and son after Stanley ka Dabba.I whole heartedly recommend it to all the hindi film fanatics.Direction: 1.5    Story: 0.5    Lead Actors: 3.5    Character Artists: 0.5    Dialogues: 1.5    Screenplay: 0.5    Music Director: 1    Lyrics: 0.5@Fan :D@Suman oh come on, it wasn't that bad. :DCopyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
