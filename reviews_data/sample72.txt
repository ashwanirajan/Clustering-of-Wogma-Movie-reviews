Too distant for city audiences to find relatable. Too superficial for smaller town audiences to find believable.Yet another “new age” woman who can't be tied down by marriage. Yet another man who wants to convince her otherwise. Yet another time, she is in tears because of a man. Yet another time, the end of the story seems written from the word go. It all seems very repetitive. Now, even the ways in which the couple is drawn towards each other hold little interest. Ultimately, it is going to be a montage of sweet moments they share. Sure, we can wait for good performances, but we have seen both Alia Bhatt and Varun Dhawan deliver far more demanding acts compared to a what looks like a run-of-the-mill rom-com. And even as there is little to hang on to in the trailer, yet another time I am hoping to be proven wrong with all my assumptions. Music Reviews:

koimoi – "3.5/5"  
Milliblog - "Superbly kitschy, pulsating and inventive remix that retains the original voices for fantastic effect, barring Badshah’s annoying rap"

Times of India - "the album is an interesting melange of songs that pander to different 'music tastebuds'"

  Hearts in the right places and good causes and a message in the film can take a film only so far. It still needs solid continuity, logical flow and a decent amount of believability. Because the message of “not accepting dowry” or “no showing a woman her place but having it for her as default” falls flat when adamant chauvinists change their beliefs before you could bat your eye. If only things were so easy, if only.I assume the makers didn't want us to “keep our brains at home” for this one. Some might claim that is an unfair assumption. In that case then, the message and attempt to make an impact is lip-service. The writing is way too weak for the film to have any impact at all. Scenes linger, and not in a good way. The film takes too long to say what it want to stay. While the main characters have grey streaks, the side characters are too stereotypical. While I didn't find a laugh in some supposedly funny situations - how is rape funny? -  it is difficult to appreciate the few laughs you get in the first half because of missing details. The lapse in logic is distracting. For example, our hero doesn't know the formula for simple interest. But, can the character really be blamed? The writer-director doesn't seem to have their Math together. Who pays the dowries for the two daughters doesn't add up? No one seems to be bothered about the cost of the lavish wedding. These are the exact things that would bother a person who has actually gone through the process of organizing a wedding. Let's not even get into the mumbo-jumbo that Badrinath's sister-in-law gives as financial advice. It boggles the mind. All that time, energy and effort spent on making a film, and no one could approach the film's accountant to give them a decent two lines? Let alone the fact that she said it all so fast, she might as well have been saying, “MutualFundinvestmentsaresubjecttomarketrisks. PleasereadtheOfferDocumentcarefullybeforeinvesting.”The other actors do play their parts alright, but the thick accents seem too put-on. It is difficult to believe that Varun Dhawan or Alia Bhatt have grown up with that background. Their performances are not bad at all. However, knowing what they are capable of, his performance came across as too generic and Alia in fact felt a little too shrill. Sure, the attempt at being progressive is obvious. But Badrinath Ki Dulhania seems to go about it rather lazily – taking the simplest “next steps” without a introspective and/or an exploratory eye at, what real life dowry cases or cases where a woman is held down, look like.

In the flick, Varun Dhawan shines as an innocent lover while Alia makes an impact with her firm attitude. The film also carries the fragrance of Indian small towns in its heart.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.This is the worst review for the movie I've ever read !!! The movie was super good ❤❤❤ !!!Aree lekin Meetu - JMD :) so much fun.RANGOON- catch on dvd for sure, BKD- watch if nothing to do? The reviewer whose perhaps among the exact 1000 admirers of the [comment partially deleted because it is a personal attack] Vishal Bharadwaj and Anurag Kashyap seems have have lost her mind yet again!! :D@Soundarya oh oops! @Annkur ha ha ha...I found a couple other things funny too, that's why not the worst rating ;)Was a one time watch! Loved it and was entertained while watching.I expected a lot from the movie. The main reason is that it's from Dharma productions and heroine is my favorite Alia ! But nothing works. sad. Good review. thank you.I cannot understand what drives me to watch your typical Dharma or YRF film.  Each time after watching the film I end up complaining more about the garbage that they dish out under the name of formulaic film.  No difference then with Badrinath Ki Dulhania.You have your classic Dharma (or YRF, both are interchangeable) formula.  Boy meets girl or girl meets boy.  Some sparks fly before love blossoms.  Then too much of senseless song and dance follows.  In function of the mood of the director, they select between mustard fields of Punjab, colourful streets of Rajasthan, green valleys of Switzerland/Austria, Snow laden mountains of Switzerland, streets of NYC, or in this case Singapore.  After about 1 and a half hours of some totally useless and irrelevant episodes the directors realise that it is time to end the film.  And so within a few minutes all the speeches, heart-changes, habit-changes happen which did not happen over 6 decades of the life of the concerned characters.  And lo and behold you have the chocolaty candy flavoured ending to the colourful extravaganza.  Absolutely nonsense formulaic films first made popular by YRF but now equally milked by Dharma.  The only reason this formula is used ad nauseam is that for whatever it is worth it still gives the return on investments to these producers.  Whose only objective is to make money.  Film-making, recounting an interesting story, presenting superlative performances in any particular department, etc. are nowhere on their priority list.  Pure simple business arithmetic – make a film for X amount and generate X times 1.25 of revenues at the minimum.The cherry on the cake is the disclaimer at the very start of the film.  In English (written and spoken), it could not have been slower for anybody to understand what is the disclaimer against.  Why make this drama of disclaimer if you do not even want to give the sufficient amount of time for your audience to read it fully.  And what about your non-English audience (in Jhansi and Kota BTW)?  No disclaimer for them?Absolutely raddi film.  Watch it if you have made it a point to give your hard earned money to Dharma and their ilks.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
