Here's a bullet point review, not because I'm busy otherwise or lazy. But because, some times, as a viewer you feel you are putting in more effort and energy into a film than the writer/director.Here's a bullet point review, not because I'm busy otherwise or lazy. But because, some times, as a viewer you feel you are putting in more effort and energy into a film than the writer/director. Yes, you guessed right. Ragini MMS 2 is like any other B-grade horror film or Horrex (Horror-Sex for the uninclined) as Ragini MMS 2 likes to call itself. Do not be surprised if I copy-paste this review for the next similarly done film in the genre.Or maybe i should have such a ready review of this nature for each genre. Now, that's a thought.

        ...RAGINI MMS-2 has ample scares, a generous dose of skin show, a winning soundtrack and of course, a sensuous Sunny Leone to spell S-U-C-C-E-S-S. This second helping is much more scrumptious and delicious than the first. Go, get spooked! ...

        ...Higher on erotica than eeriness, Ragini MMS 2 is more than a ‘horrex’ film. Given that some of the scares fall flat and turn funny, one can as well call it ‘horrexedy’ (horror, sex, comedy). Be that as it may, the film is an entertaining watch for sure....

And when I say used, I mean in the proper exploitative way as a hot actress is used in a B-Grade flick. She gets to wear all the sexy lingerie you wanted to see her in, and thrusts her stuff repeatedly....

: watch it if u likes ragini mms 1.. or like horror flicks that are actually funny
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review....what about ankhon dekhi ?@MEETU I was expecting a summarized  review , even if it isn't ur taste at least write about the pros and cons . Nevertheless the pointers as mentioned above have compelled me to give it a try . :)@Divya The only shows of Ankho Dekhi playing in Pune were in far off theaters with no guarantee that the show will be played if there aren't enough people interested. I chose to not take the risk. Though I really want to see the movie. @Guddu Don't know if you are bored reading, but I am bored of making the same old complaints. If you notice, I don't get too nasty/sarcastic when i don't like a film. So, I don't go overboard in making fun of the film. This self-restriction leaves very little room for creativity and making the review interesting when the film is not.Oh and @guddu thank you for the compliment! I have been striving for this from the first review I wrote. Irrespective of whether or not I like the film, help the reader make a decision about whether or not they want to watch the film....believe me ...its worth the risk...also liked your self restraint in making fun of bad movies...most of others, including me, might find that difficult...hallmark of a good criticI was actually expecting nothing out of this film .. but it was better than what i expected... sunny leone did okay acting.. she wasnt horrible.. if u liked ragini mms 1 .. u cud enjoy this one.. i agree it wasnt really scary as such.. but with a group of friends u cud enjoy this movieCopyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
