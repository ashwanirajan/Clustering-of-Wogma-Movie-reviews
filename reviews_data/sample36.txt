Raw in its treatment, this noir film starts of well but loses its way and doesn't end so. A film with Nawazuddin Siddiqui at center stage – is by that merit itself worth a watch. This one seems to be a thriller with a twist. A contest between two contract killers and because it is Nawazuddin Siddiqui, you are on his side, even after watching only two minutes of the film. He is not even portrayed as a likeable person, let alone a good one who we don't want bad things to happen to. That is the power of both story-telling, performance and a sound dose of preconceived notions. Also, it is the promise of multi-layered, non-uni-dimensional characters. Sincerely hoping the film follows through. Babumoshai Bandookbaaz releases on 25 August, 2017.

  Babumoshai Bandookbaaz is as raw and rugged as any noir film set in the world of politicians who double-cross and hire contract killers can be expected to be. It stays crude through the sex and violence – both of which it has in plenty. However, what gives way is its limp writing in the last half hour. Over the years, I have learnt not to be led on by great starts and greater build-ups. Far too many times, the climax is well...anti-climatic. While I wouldn't call Babumoshai Bandookbaaz anti-climatic, but it is rather disappointing because it seems like a cop out. All the strength of the film though is in its characters. There isn't a good soul in this  milieu. They are all just different shades of dark grey. As sad as that is, it is sadder that that's the reason the film feels real. Of course, brilliant performances across the board help things along. I don't know if I will ever tire of seeing Nawazuddin Siddiqui in a crude villager's role. Especially the one who has a swagger. But then here, everyone has a swagger, and each one carries it with elan. Banke (Jatin Goswami), Phulva (Bidita Bag), the various police officers, their wives, the politicians and a politician's wife – all behave as if they own the place. The film has a very interesting set of women characters. Most of them are strong-headed. Most of them are the kind you wouldn't cross in a hurry. And very interestingly, the leading men and the main side characters – are all respectful or rather not threatened of the women's independence. Of course, there is letching and prostitution is shown openly. But, the women are far from submissive. And yet it all looks real. That's how well the characters are written. If only, the writers didn't lose steam towards the end. What is heartening though is that the main draw of this film was Nawazuddin Siddiqui and of the three films I saw today, the other two had two other people in the audience. Babumoshai Bandookbaaz was almost house full, and in a bigger hall too! Whether or not I like the film, that a non-standard film gets its chance with the audience makes this festive season even brighter. And this one does it despite being dark to the core.

        ...Certainly, BABUMOSHAI BANDOOKBAAZ is Kushan Nandy's most ambitious and technically his best film. The fascination to the radicalism of Anurag Kashyap is evident, there is nothing wrong in getting inspired but Kashyap had a clear point of view in GOW and RAMAN RAGHAV 2.0. Even after accepting its gimmicks, sensationalisms and hinterland exotica, the point of view behind BABUMOSHAI BANDOOKBAAZ is not clear, is it a black comedy on sharp shooters, or a morality lesson that crime doesn't pay?

It’s a film pretending to be a stylishly raw gangster saga originated in the interiors of the Hindi heartland, but in reality, it’s nothing more than another attempt to look at the crime prone lower strata of society through a rose tinted glass. Sadly, Babumoshai Bandookbaaz never pierces our hearts.

Goswami is a fitting sparring partner for Siddiqui and brings a likeable quality to his roguish Banke. Bag is sufficiently sensual, Dutta requisitely assertive.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Only Nawaz can make a low budget movie run like a machine in today's bollywood industry.Bang on with the review...felt very raw and realistic...witty dialogue...got a bit restless towards the end..admire Bidita for taking up that difficult role..loved the independence and sensuality she portrayed ever so well...as for Nawaz, he excels in such roles, so not much to say there..Overall a definite watchCopyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
