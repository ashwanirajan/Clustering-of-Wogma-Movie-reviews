This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Laxmikant Kabadiya (Anupam Kher) dies and his family wants to keep his death from the world for a couple days and then another couple days and then another few days...
Sorry, readers, my brains were shut off while watching this movie, so couldn't allow myself to jot down anything for the sections that usually appear here.
What Worked


What did not
Note: This section simply lists the things that I did not like in this movie. This is not the overall impression about this movie. Please read the full review here


Nitty-Gritty
This section lists things that I think are not important to the overall impact of the movie. In most cases, it could be explained away by something like, "we noticed the glitch after the scene was shot and there were schedule/budget issues and thus we could not re-shoot it". I like giving the makers the benefit of doubt, but I am amused nevertheless. Hopefully, they will tickle you too.

Review - Buddha Mar Gaya...An easy winner for the most distasteful comedy ever! ...epifinibox, i've no clue where this came from...but...ok...For all Tamil Songs LyricsVisit: http://www.tamillyrics.co.inFor all Hindi Songs LyricsVisit: http://www.hindilyrics4u.co.inFor all Telugu Songs LyricsVisit: http://www.telugulyrics.co.inMeeta - what on Earth was that, and what did they use to blackmail or extort Anupam Kher and Om Puri to appear in it? We barely made it twenty minutes in before we all agreed to turn it off in disgust - although hearing Kher intone "You Will Die Laughing" over and over again in the opening credits number was kind of funny, maybe? I don't think I've seen a film that relentlessly witless since I was watching stupid American sex comedies in the 1970s. Next to it, God Tussi Great Ho comes off as a model of intelligence and good taste. I see from the credits that Paresh Rawal came in later. I'm not sure if it's brave of him to push the envelope of "What's Funny" in Indian comedy so insistently, or appalling that he's in so much utter crap.@TimELiebe This movie is just not worth the discussion!@Meeta - I shall confine it to the same pile we consigned Vivah....@TimELiebe and worse...Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
