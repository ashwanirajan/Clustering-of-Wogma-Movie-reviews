wogma rating: Add to 'must watch' list (?) - This rating is for kids only!!
    
  While there is nothing spectacularly unpredictable about the storyline or the side-stories, there are subtle spontaneous moments along the way that make it an endearing watch overall. More so for the target audience - kids. It’s the preachy monologues towards the end and the on-the-face-ridiculous-climax that blemish the experience.There are no pretensions here of making this a profound message movie to please all ages. It is very clearly meant for kids below ten and doesn't lose focus. In fact, they bank heavily upon the supposedly limited movie watching experience of these children. This is evident through the very expected turn of events - from the micro sub-sub-plots to the ultimate climax. It’s the sweet understated instances that keep the wire live though.

Fantasy tales fascinate me immensely. We leave the whole world open for the storyteller to explore. He can take us anywhere he wishes with no obligation to stick to reality. It is entirely up to him to use the leverage that we so liberally give him.  Yet Jay (story writer) has very admirably tried his best to remain rooted to the ground. The side effect though is that the basic plot is pretty much unimaginative and thus has no surprises. 
The restraint shows in all other departments too. The camerawork very appropriately doesn't take you dizzying through MTV land. Which also means the editor is not behaving as if he has these new toys called 'scissors' and 'sticky tape'. Sorry guys, forgive me, I have still not overcome the shock called Jhoom Barabar Jhoom. Visually, Chain Kulii Ki Main Kulii equals a soothing boat ride on a calm lake while Jhoom Barabar Jhoom equals a rocky car ride on the potholed monsoon roads of Pune (India). Okay - digression ends here. 
Rahul Bose is his usual calm and composed self too. The kids behave like kids except for the one or two times that they get all philosophical and reflective on the adults. Patently unnatural. And the other dialogues are too natural and thus basically boring. The music is actually infuriating. Especially "Sunday Sunday" which is a blatant copy of "Na bole tum na maine kuch kaha" of Baton Baton MeinFantasy tales fascinate me immensely.

They had it all - the mandatory Sardar (Sikh), the left-handed captain star-batsman, the Muslim pace bowler, the number 10 T-shirt, a coach that experiments with the batting line-up, and last but not the least - a chauvinistic dig at the female commentator who "obviously" knows nothing about the game. 
So, plan of action for the weekend - take the kids to the theater while you stay out looking for some other form of entertainment to alternate between loo and fag breaks. And at the end of it all, together you can say, "What fun!?"

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Karan (Zain Khan) is an orphan who chances upon a cricket bat that empowers him to be the wildest batsman ever. Lady luck takes him through to the Indian cricket team. The movie is then about his interactions with the captain of this team, Varun (Rahul Bose).Karan (Zain Khan) is an orphan who chances upon a cricket bat that empowers him to be the wildest batsman ever. Lady luck takes him through to the Indian cricket team. The movie is then about his interactions with the captain of this team, Varun (Rahul Bose).
The transition of Karan from a street kid to a star batsman was done very well. The focus never shifted from him being naïve about the ways of high society. From diction to mannerisms.
Names of the cricket commentators - Nadira and Maru - purely coincidental that they rhyme with Mandira and Charu. 
The crack on the inanities of cricket commentators. Excellent dig!

The predictable way in which the movie began. The dream sequence and the morning at the orphanage were plain silly.
Monologues, first by Rahul Bose and then by Zain Khan.
The climax of the last match! The tone and direction of the last ball did not match the overall tone of the movie at all.

Kapil Dev's signature changed towards the end of the movie.
