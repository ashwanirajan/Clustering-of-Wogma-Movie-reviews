wogma rating: Watch if you have nothing better to do (?)
Preachy lines about family bonding and brotherly love are doze-worthy especially considering you have almost 3-hours of time to squeeze a snooze in.NOT A REVIEW - Just wondering how much drama makes melodrama and how much melodrama makes intolerable melodrama...The promo has Katrina Kaif giving Salman Khan a piece of her mind where she vehemently asserts that he is a "hardcore anti-family man".  And she doesn't let you miss that accent. So, bang! You know this one is about rapidly deteriorating family values.There is something very irksome about being preached to on how the present generation has no feelings and all that matters is money. This irritation only solidified with the following quote from the director's interview with Mid-dayHmph...me no likes the prejudice against my generation. But, then you remember which generation he comes from and realize his difficult predicament - So you take the characters he'll portray with a pinch of salt and move on. What terrifies me is that on the lookout for new emotions, he finds this the most interesting (from the movie's official blog) -Uhhh...Mahabharat, anyone? Granted Mahabharata is much more interesting and intriguing than Ramayana, but it certainly is not new!And then there is this tidbit on why he has a new woman as his lead lady with every movie. It's juicy fodder for women's lib - Ouch! But the woman in question, doesn't really mind as per this bit from an interview with The Telegraph -
 He is someone whose cinema I have admired. It is so larger than life for me. So when I was offered the film, it really didn’t matter what I was doing in it. I think every actress wants a chance to work with Subhash Ghai. At least once.  As you say woman, as long as you promise not to hold on to this expression for, like, forever. 
And wait, things get scarier, the director continues with -ahem looks like Mr. Ghai has rated the movie for us already! Let's see - grand scale, rich visuals, great sound all add their bit to the drama. And when all put together, there's huge potential for melodrama. Not to mention that the sets look like they are out of a Sanjay Leela Bhansali movie. So, music seems to be the highpoint of the movie. And I'm a huge fan of Taal's music when Subhash Ghai and A. R. Rahman got together.  But this review by an avid blogger, Ramanand isn't very flattering - As far as I'm concerned, haven't heard the music and anyway, any music takes a while to grow on me.But a ray of hope comes from "The Hindu" - 

If sources are to be believed Anil's reference point in "Yuvvraaj" is Tom Hanks in "Forrest Gump".But we have the final blow in the form of a caveat from Ghai again -For now though, all focus on trying not to judge the book by it's cover.

  When you hear Salman Khan saying, "Ram jaisa bhai" (a brother like Lord Ram) your reflex action is to rub your eyes and check if you entered a Rajshri Productions' film by mistake. But then all this while the eyes were witnessing a Sanjay Leela Bhansali set-up. So, a Hindi film enthusiast should be all set to get dazed and dazzled. The advantage to this though is that in contrast the story and characters are as simple as can be.You know what simple means, right? Black and white. And eventually black turns white. Sure there are a couple characters like the lawyer (Mithun Chakravorty) and the maternal uncle (Anjan Srivastav) that make you wonder if they are black or white for a bit. But then you lose interest. The writers clearly want me to take sides, but don't give me enough details to be bothered.Neither can I be made to really care about the main characters. 2 out of the 4 (Salman Khan and Zayed Khan) are losers - and sore ones at that. One is eye candy trying out her emoting skills - that would obviously be Katrina Kaif. That lady is certainly at her elegant best, though.  And the only one who was worth watching, for his supposedly autistic behavior, Anil Kapoor has very little screen time.Now, a simple wiki search tells you that autism is "is characterized by impaired social interaction and communication". But our man is social enough to lecture his beloved uncle on family values. And he has befriended children and adults who have bothered to interact with him. Not to mention he has grown appropriately in his flirting capabilities. Ok, we shall not hold story-writers responsible for the big words they off-handishly throw our way. Please, can we have them write a decent, engrossing story? The Archie-Veronica angle and her rich dad spouting exaggerated insults at him is yawnnnn. It's a musical extravaganza madam, you expect the wrong things all the time.Now that is one thing Yuvvraaj cannot be accused of - lacking in the song and dance department. I actually enjoyed listening to the songs, barring "aaja main hawaon mein". And for being distracted during that one, I can actually blame the phobia I have for animated petals after Drona. The way the other songs were picturised did have a broadway musical feel to them,  and this was ratified by an all out replication of the makeup from the CATS musical. BUT, stick to that. Please don't have Salman Khan talk to Beethoven. Anyway, we could have done with a lot less of familial blah-blah. That would also help in reducing the length that is stretched to almost 3 hours.

The style in which the name of the movie is written both in English and in Hindi. The musical note at the end of the 'y' adds to the grace, I think.
The police officer's 'aah' after Salman Khan says - "he is a brother, Indian brother". Had such a hearty laugh. One of those laughs where you don't care if the joke was intentional or otherwise.
Salman Khan dropping the gun while requesting Boman Irani to help him out.

The ramble in the beginning by the writer. What was the point? To establish characters? The lines were rather lame!
Is a testimony by an autistic patient allowed in the court of Law?
Salman Khan's sudden entries and exits to save Anil Kapoor.
Genius disorder - they really call it that? Wow!
Brotherly love expressed by bandaging a cut on the index finger. Nope! Not happening!! The mock applause from the entire audience proved it.
Obviously, the part where Anil Kapoor sings a complete classical Indian song while he is having an asthama attack AND was poisoned...geez!
We better not expect much. Salman would overact in each and every scene, after all!Man!
