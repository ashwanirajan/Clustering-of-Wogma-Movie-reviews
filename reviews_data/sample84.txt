Sure, Kahaani 2 has good performances and a great underlying message to the story. But, unfortunately it isn't a tight thriller nor does it have an unpredictable story. Without a doubt Kahaani 2 is the most exciting sequel in this current shower of sequels. It's the fourth in 3 weeks out of which one was alright and the other two were outright bad – as films, not just as sequels. Since disappointment is typical for sequels, we have to tone the expectation down a notch. It is difficult to do  so though after the rise in curiosity with the trailer. However, I have to shake the feeling of Jazbaa out before walking into Kahaani 2.Fortunately, we aren't going to be too surprised on the acting front, right? Oh wait, there's Arjun Rampal. But hey, even so, Vidya Balan has the potential to compensate for any and all other shortcomings on the acting front.With all that's going against Kahaani 2 – the sequel syndrome, the [Jazbaa] story template, the possibility of supporting actors failing to do well – the film has enough to look forward to mainly because the story much meatier than the usual. Here's hoping it is so. Music Reviews:

  As suspected, the thriller bit is toned down a lot in Kahaani 2's story. This is despite the pulsating air the film carries about it. Even for a simple thing like a missed morning alarm (at the beginning of the film), the background music runs as if it is building up to the final stages of the big reveal. Yet, despite all the prompting by the music, the story doesn't make the heart race because what comes about is more or less expected. This predictability doesn't work for any story, even less so for a thriller. Sure, it wants to create awareness about an important issue. While it may feel like the issue is weaved into the story, whenever characters go into “talking about it” mode, it becomes evident that they are talking to us as the audience and not to each other. Having said that, one scene between Vidya Balan and little Naisha Khanna had me stunned. I couldn't move because the direct attack on the topic was unexpected and liberating. Even tied in with this video we made a few years ago. (Warning: Content of this video might give the movie away.) It is one of those movie moments that will stick. Of course, if it were not for Vidya Balan who spoke as naturally as any responsible mother would to an appropriately repressed Naisha Khanna, the scene wouldn't have been half as effective. But, that Naisha Khanna, the child actor, had to do such a scene where she confesses something that hopefully hasn't happened to her in real life - again raises a question about the ethics of child actors and the roles they play in some movies. I was waiting for the day I could use a word other than “furniture” for Arjun Rampal's act. Even if his personality is too polished for the gritty surroundings of a run-down police station, his facial expressions have moved to the next level. It is time now for body language and voice modulation to play a role too. I am sure with company like Vidya Balan, it is only a matter of time. Same goes for Manini Chadha. Vidya Balan herself makes being worried look like such an easy thing to do. She teases the audience exactly like the writer-director wanted her character to – building the suspense and suspect just right. The casting of the “villain” is spot on. Especially considering its consistency with the point the film wants to make. However, the two big reveals are totally predictable - the worst that can happen to a thriller. Beyond that then, the voiceover and flashback methods used to show the audience what happened is rather painful. This is where the baggage of the director's last film's success weighs in. You don't expect the extent to which these routes are taken. You don't expect there to be any real-life self-referencing in a film by Sujoy Ghosh, even if it's subtle. And thus you end up cringing a little more than you would when it comes about in a film where you expect it. Even so, Kahaani 2 isn't pulled down by expectations as much as it is by some lackluster writing. There are no real twists to speak of and the most of the other part of the story feels like an “awareness campaign” rather than scenes in a film.

But, comparisons are bound to arise and unfortunately it doesn’t leave the same lingering satisfaction and awe like the first movie. It delivers good on its promise of keeping the audience hooked, and Sujoy Ghosh handles the subject matter very delicately with a fine eye for detail. If you like your slow burning whodunits then Kahaani 2 is a good watch.

vivek17b:
          If you look beyond the silliness of the second half, Kahaani 2 is such an enjoyable film. Balan is back and how!

RedAlbiceleste:
          Kahaani 2 is a decent attempt. Predictable events in second half disappointed me. But the first half was very gripping and actors did well!
        
Rajyasree:
          Wondering what to expect from Kahaani 2? Here's my review. Beautiful Bengal, great acting, but that's not enough. https://t.co/HCVWXcLBjh

MeeklyDumbfound:
          Kahaani 2, two and half stars...
        
MaskedRiot:
          Saw Kahaani 2.
The film's not bad. It lacks the thrill and suspense of part 1 and is predictable for most part, but pretty good like that.
        
manbhan05:
          Watched kahaani 2. 1st half was better than 2nd. Though best was the NATIONAL ANTHEM before the movie. 
#NationalAnthem 
#goosebumps
        
boyplunger1978:
          Kahaani 2 was just ok. Not my choice...
        
auldtimer:
          Kahaani 2 is an enjoyable film but not as gripping a tale as 1
        
Addiey_:
          I liked Kahaani the first more than Kahaani 2. The twists this time are tad too predictable.
        
SudarshanEMA:
          Can't figure if Kahaani 2 or Bengal, what's more depressing!!
        
sidtap:
          Kahaani 2 was a disappointment. Terrible second half. @sujoy_g.
        
seemajohri6:
          Kahaani 2 is definitely below expectations, and will only excite you if you're a Vidya Balan fan.
        
sandeepsabnani:
          Kahaani 2 is #meh. 

Go watch Kahaani again and you'll feel happier.

KAHAANI 2:
Not upto the mark.
As a sequel you have to come up with a better story and screenplay.
Not Recommended

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Overall it was a one time watch. That too for Vidya Balan.Very few Hindi film thrillers have been executed superbly as was Kahaani.  It was a sleeper hit to say the least - but it is a gem of a film to watch and rewatch.Fast forward to Kahaani 2, the franchise.  And the least that can be said about K2 the better.The social message that K2 promotes is praiseworthy.  But a good message does not equate to a good film making.  If the film making (story included) is very weak and contrived then the message does not reach far, which is precisely what happens to K2.For anyone who had seen the social media video [comment partially deleted because it might give movie away] (the video is embedded in Meetu's review above), K2 is just a 2hour + version of the same video.Vidya Balan making a comeback after a hiatus of few years does not make any real impact.  Arjun Ramphal might have appeared a too much glossy choice for the role of a semi-urban public services servant.  But he does manage to fit into the role of a small town police officer relegated to doing petty cases - credit to him.The film, in my belief, goes down the drain due to an extremely weak writing.  Also, I believe that Indians are yet to accept [comment partially deleted because it might give movie away] as a crime - despite many films (past and present) making a case that it is widespread in the Indian society.All in all, K2 is an also ran, nothing much to write about its performance.@Fan Thank you for all your comments across films. Just wanted to point out that video is not about "sex education".Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.

Parental Guidance:


Violence: A few fist fights, murders and attempt to murders.
Language: Save for one abusive dialogue, clean
Nudity & Sexual content: Two scenes where sex is implied. Pedophilia is one of the strong themes.
Concept: A guardian trying to save the ward, at all costs. Also, is on an awareness campaign about child sex abuse.
General Look and Feel: Set in a gritty, small town in West Bengal, Kahaani 2 has a pulsating thriller air about it.
