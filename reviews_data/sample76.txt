As we'd expect from the trailers, a satirical, court-room drama that keeps you engaged for the 2+ hours. Won't stay for too long after though. Jolly LL.B 2 looks like it is taking care of all the issues I had with the first installment, Jolly L.L.B. It seems to have lost its comical gimmickry. Instead, the “courtroom” in “courtroom drama” seems to be taking stage rather than plain drama. Both defence and prosecution feel like they have done their homework and more.The “more” bit is a little worrisome because it will yet again take away from what could be real-life like. Sure, with Akshay Kumar getting in the “up against the system” mode, melodrama cannot be kept at bay. But, there one can always hope for some restraint, right?It does help that courtroom dramas haven't become commonplace enough to make you wonder whether or not it will more of the same.Music Reviews:
Bollywood Hungama - "3/5" 
glamsham - "3/5" 
Milliblog - "Middling multi-composer mix, this." 
Movie Talkies – "3/5" 
Music Aloud – "2.5/10" 
Times of India - "the songs are short in duration, but make a powerful impact."   
    - meeta, a part of the audience
  On the surface, it'd look like Jolly LLB 2 has Akshay Kumar do something different from the norm - relatively fewer songs, lesser drama than we'd expect, make it seem different. Soon enough though, we realise that the common man/police officer (be it from Singham, Dabangg, Rowdy Rathore, etc) who takes on the system is replaced by a lawyer. Even so, the drama, the back and forth between the two lawyers and the ever-entertaining judge in Saurabh Shukla keep you interested through the 2+ hours.That's not to say, every minute is engaging. There are many scenes that stretch longer than necessary. They are usually at emotional turning points in the film. However, those extra seconds spent to underline the drama, take away from the impact. The courtroom drama too goes back and forth borderlining unbelievable every once in a while. But, that could just be to bring in the dreariness of the court room to the theater. The unrealistic bit is, of course the satire, intended to keep things light. Like they say in the film, you have to smile because you are in Lucknow. The satire within the court room works. However that outside the room, seems a bit much, even if it is hilarious. I am referring to a cricket match here. Or even the other wink at women power through Jolly's wife (Huma Qureshi). The rest of the writing conveniently bounces back and forth between the two sides of the case, keeping things interesting, but not entirely unexpected. What took me by surprise is the performances. They are not overboard. None of them were subtle, of course. But none were intolerably in-the-face. Each actor, be it Saurabh Shukla, Annu Kapoor or Huma Qureshi, owned the screen when they were on it. Akshay Kumar (Jolly) on the other hand merges with the background – in a good way.  Even if I discount my bias towards “stars” who tone their stardom down, Akshay Kumar makes you believe equally his helplessness and his over-confidence despite some very filmy lines. The State vs. Jolly LLB 2 is worth the time you spend watching it. Whether or not it is worth the energy spent in going to the theater and back, and the extra multiplex bucks will depend on your affection for Akshay Kumar, satire, courtroom drama and so on.

In his new ‘serious actor’ avatar, Akshay Kumar excels and effortlessly does the henpecked husband (to Huma Qureshi’s Gucci-craving Pushpa) as well as the committed lawyer role well. His performance is aided and enhanced by the wonderful supporting actors—theatre has obviously become a big hunting ground for talent scouts.

It’s a typical Hindi film featuring a known star banking on the borrowed characters, prominently dealing in jokes and some well written dialogues much more than any solid story progression. Further it mocks the court and the chair of honourable judge too in a highly shameless manner crossing the limit of respect and dignity unlike its gracefully original. And therefore fails to prove any better sequel as usual like in many recent cases.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.'Sure, with Akshay Khanna getting in the “up against the system” mode, melodrama cannot be kept at bay.'I guess, you mean 'Akshay Kumar'.Yes of course, @Swapnil! I meant Kumar not Khanna. Fixed it. Thank you for pointing it out.Awesome movie and great acting by Akshay Kumar. He is really changing the face of Indian cinema with his movies like BABY, GABBAR IS BACK, AIRLIFT, RUSTOM and now JOLLY LLB 2.There was a dialogue in the very first few minutes of the movie when AKSHAY say to another man , "SAARI PADHAYI AAJ HI KAREGA KYA" ? And the tone with which AKSHAY says it , was as same as he said the famous dialogue 20 years ego "BACHE KI JAAN LEGA KYA"? What i want to say is that i agree AKSHAY is a very good actor , but somehow it started to feel like he has very limited amount of way to play a character , and he is not doing anything new. And m not talking about the theme of the movies he select(which i think are great except crap comedies) , rather m talking about thw characters he is playing.in his last film RUSTOM , AKSHAY has had made the Joke out of one of the most Landmark case in the history of Indian Judiciary System. And although JOLLY LL2 is better then RUSTOM still the irrelevant jokes (not intrinsic like JOLLY LLB 1, rather forcefully added) take over the main plot which was not much of an interesting thing.  I went to watch a good court room drama made engaging through nice investigation and down to earth humor , rather i get a half hearted murder case suger coated with a lot of good but irrelevant jokes .If Akshay Kumar is monotonous I wonder what his critics have to say about the likes of Srk & Salman who give the same set of 5 expressions be it while playing a romantic hero, a gangster, a messiah or a wrestler. Jolly llb 2 is yet another feather in Akshay's cap after classics like Baby & Airlift and entertainers like Special 26 & Omg! His expressions, dialect and mannerisms in each of these films has been chalk and cheese. Jolly llb 2 might not be the best courtroom drama but is definitely entertaining enough and filled with dark humor to keep u hooked on for over 2 hours.Anuj - Entertaining - Yes. Good Courtroom Drama - No.And yes , i also find Salmaan and SRK monotonous , since many years now. But i didnt hadAnuj - Entertaining - Yes. Good Courtroom Drama - No.And yes , i also find Salmaan and SRK monotonous , since many years now. But i didnt had  that problem with Akshay , its only after BABY (which was his last film i liked) he felt like monotonous.. Its like he can play only two characters 1. The serious one (Baby , Special 26 , Rustam) , or the Mockery One (Jolly Llb , Housefull series , Welcome , Singh is Kind and Bling).. But again thankfuly his movies are not monotonous as his expressions.There comes very few movies like OMG where i find something new in his acting. He is good in all the above mentioned movies , but not something which he havent shown earlier..Barring his voice/baritone (something out of his control), every single performance of his has been near perfect, be it a mythological Lord in OMG!, a conman in Special 26, a commando in Baby, toned down intensity in Airlift, mass entertaining avatars in Holiday/Gabbar and Rustom or his usual buffonery in Housefull 3 and Singh is Bling. An absolute entertainer whose reinvented himself like few can at his age and stage of their careers.Entertaining: Yes. Good Courtroom Drama, based on local courts: Yes. its full timepass movie not much serious drama.Barring a few exceptions, most of the time the part 2 of any film is quite a mundane watch.  But Jolly 2 falls in the exception to this rule category.The first installment of this series was most likely a sleeper hit.  First of all with (almost the full) Munnabhai leading characters, it gave the impression of being a Munna inspired film.  Not only did it prove the perceptions wrong, it went ahead and carved its own niche place.  The success of which leads to the second installment.The second installement makes for an interesting watch.  It has its melodramatic moments, it has its drama (in filmy style), it has its masala formula here and there - and still it worked big time for me.  It started off giving a feeling of being a commercial version of Shahid - but soon it steered into its own territory and established its stamp.The basic theme of Robin Hood style justice has always been the audiences preference ever since Amitabh Bachhan made it a super hit formula in the 1970s.  Show some social injustice, revel before hand your darker characters, paint characters in more or less black or white (little space for grey characters), show your underdog/underprivileged hero as the champion for the victim (Robin Hood).  And very soon you have the audience completely in the control of the director.  Provided of course the lead actors, the story, the direction is good; which is the case with Jolly LLB2.Akshay Kumar is in magnificient form.  Hats off to him for delivering yet again an energetic and convincing performance.  He is a wonder machine, delivering 3 to 4 hits a year with differing styles and roles.  He is very ably supported by Annu Kapoor as your evil than devil lawyer.  You have seen villains portraying such lawyers countless number of times in the films, yet Annu Kapoor does it with style and perfection that keep you staring at him with awe as the Advocate Mathur.  The going-ons are also superbly supported by Saurabh Shukla who reprises his role as the judge who is so accustomed to the court proceedings that he gives an impression of being suffering a "life-time imprisonment sentence as a judge".  He is amazing, once again gets a good share of the meaty role.  Huma Qureshi has a relatively tiny role, but is still wonderful in that.  Portrays very well the typical modern housewife in a conservative residential background in a B-town.  Vinod Nagpal, as the father Siddiqui, does well too.The film is a commercial film, and so has its drama.  I am not sure real life courtrooms, even in Lucknow, would tolerate this kind of drama whilst the court is in session.  But let us ignore that for a commercial Hindi film.  The Kashmir issue, and the issues on terrorism (black or white) are discussed at large - but at the end of the day it is a statement once again on how our justice system is failing us due to the laborious nature and volume (1 judge per 1 lakh citizen was the figure cited).  The proceedings get dull, technical, delaying, repeatitive, so much so that the lawyers judges bailiffs police etc. just consider it a routine without sparing a second thought for the victims who are knocking the court's doors for justice.  Justice delayed is justice denied, but in our system even with delays the justice is not served correctly.  Message comes across well, the execution of the script is fairly tight once the real film takes off, thankfully no songs are interspersed to slow down the speed or to loosen the grip.  When the end comes, you might end up having goose bumps - even though you know that the film certainly does not reflect real life.A nice watch, makes you proud of the few good men who do exist in India and who do fight against the system to make a small but significant change.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
