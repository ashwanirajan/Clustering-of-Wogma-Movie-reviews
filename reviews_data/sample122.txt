For what it's worth, I'd consider it a positive that I didn't find it too much of a torture. Have I just gotten used to it or is the confusion in Housefull 3 a little more amusing than Housefull and Housefull 2? Hey, before you roll your eyes, it is only relative. Any film which has the first shot in the trailer imply that dancing in western clothes is not cultured can only be so funny. The three women will be props for sure. Only included so the men could fight over whether or not they get married. Inclusion of Abhishek Bachchan to this mix says a lot about his career's graph. Though, hopefully his sense of comic timing has potential to add value, even if he doesn't seem to have too much scope from what we see in the trailer. Akshay Kumar and Riteish Deshmukh do exactly what they are expected to – more of the same. This is one of those movies that I go to watch hoping that there will be a laugh or two – that is a laugh or two more than I expect. (This preview was written in the second week of May and has been auto-published.)

  Someone I know read out a forwarded joke with full enthusiasm, “Listen to this one, it is hilarious! Why do chickens sit on eggs? Because they don't have chairs.”  I am stumped trying to figure out why this is funny. “How do they even think of this stuff!? Hats off to their brains!”, she goes on. I refrain from trying to point out that chickens don't sit on eggs. That is exactly the kind of humor Housefull 3 carries. It doesn't make you laugh much but you are dumbstruck thinking about the process which might have brought out the joke – the overall plot, the situations, the puns, the slapstick, everything. That awe takes the edge off the torture but there is enough in the form of regressive concepts, racism, sexism and other forms of insensitivity that you would rather avoid.The two main types of humor that Housefull 3 banks on are the forwarded variety or the kind that are with the intention of being insensitive. There is a third type in the form of performances, but of the lot only Akshay Kumar puts in all his energy. While it still didn't make me laugh, he was doing a lot more than just contorting his face. Of course, he was the only one who had a character with scope for doing more. Abhishek Bachchan and Riteish Deshmukh don't really have much to make their characters look or feel different from each other. Boman Irani too is the typical loud character you would find in every slapstick.Similarly, the ladies Jacqueline Fernandez, Lisa Haydon and Nargis Fakhri play the regular props who are supposed to make us differentiate between cultured and uncultured women by their attire. Oh well.Actually I got one good laugh. It was a real hoot to see how self-aware the film-makers are. They actually included a scene that confesses and apologizes for all that is wrong about the film. It is always funny when people know that what they are doing is wrong and go ahead and do it anyway.As far as the story goes, it is hard to say whether there was some method to the silliness or we have gotten used to it so much that it seems like the new normal. Just a different shade of intolerable.

        ...Housefull 3 is neither the best comedy film in Bollywood nor it aims to be. Yet, it is the best film of the franchise (not that there is much to aim there…), as it is far more entertaining and funnier than its predecessors. Go for it, if you like mindless entertainers, and I am sure you will not be disappointed!

        ...On the whole, HOUSEFULL 3 has all the constituents of an archetypal Hindi masala movie with hilarity, absurdity, humour, gags and punches in abundance. The film is a madcap entertainer which delivers guffaws, belly laughs and over-the-top slapstick humour in gigantic proportion. The film however is bound to get diverse reactions from the audiences. If you admire and relish these entertainers, and are passionate about cinema of this variety, then HOUSEFULL 3 is definitely a stress buster for you. Else, you can stay away from this. At the Box-Office, HOUSEFULL 3 will appeal only to the masses, the aam aadmi, who relish hardcore masala movies.

Here would like to add, that we all love to see Akshay featuring in these mindless comedies too using his impeccable comic timing widely known to all. But dancing to such awfully degraded lyrics………….. really hurts a lot!

No joke falls from the sky, just like that.

The confounding script gets it even more complicated by inserting Urja Nagre (Jackie Shroff) a former underworld Don who appears to have a personal interest in the future of the three belles. And there’s Chunky Pandey rehashing his Aakhri Pasta with so much cheese that it grates on your nerves. The jokes and slap-stick are of the repetitive variety- the kind you have read on the internet/social media time and again.

It's as if its makers want you to know that they have spent a lot on the actresses' make-up and skimpy wardrobe, the locations and the ghastly songs with innumerable extras. The humour is crass -it's oh-so-hilarious to rob young women of the ability to have kids. The move of suddenly turning overtly serious doesn't work neither do the puns. The slapstick humour is only exhausting and not engaging one bit.  Of the cast, the one who occasionally manages to pull off the ridiculousness is Akshay Kumar. It isn't a good sign at all that for a film that proclaims to be a comedy that the audience spends most of it in pin-drop silence. ...

The replacements — a certain director duo called Sajid-Farhad, do what any substitute would — play up the format's signature sequences, marginalise Chunky Pandey and hope for a miracle. But they only go on to prove that if laughter is the best medicine, this film will make you beg for euthanasia.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Houseful was alright (for me, not for the serious movie loving kind).Houseful 2 was quite loud, but at the BO it still did magic.Houseful 3 trailer looks to be going on same lines sans Sajid Khan.  The last snippet in the trailer makes me wonder if it is not partly inspired by the black and white classic - Dekh Kabira Roya?He was always popular among the masses and has now expanded his fan base among the urban audiences as well. For every urban entertainer like BABY, he can deliver a mass entertainer like GABBAR. For every intense socio political drama like AIRLIFT, he can deliver an outright slapstick comedy like Housefull 3. All this in a span of 18 months. That's Akshay Kumar for you! #ThumbsUpWait - how did Abhishek Bachchan end up in the Housefull series, anyway? Isn't that kind of like "I just did a hit comedy with some slightly controversial theme - so I'm going to do the second sequel to a series that partly uses that movie as a punchline?" Big B must be so proud of his kid sliding into Direct-to-Video fare....I guess there are 3 kinds of comedies in Hindi cinema today. One is the dark/adulterated theme like Delhi Belly, Kaminey and Phas Gaya Re Obama. Udta Punjab seems to be following the trend. I love most of it as long as they're watchable. The second is the cheap, vulgar sexual innuendo filled stuff (which i don't mind at all if genuinely funny, which unfortunately never happens in bollywood films of this genre) like Grand Masti and Kya Kool Hain Hum series. The third is the worst of the lot. The mindless, loud over the top slapstick stuff popularized by the likes of Rohit Shetty, Anees Bazmee and Sajid Khan. The only movie i've genuinely liked in this genre is Golmaal 1 and Singh Is King (in bits and pieces). Even the much hyped blockbuster Chennai Express was an exercise in boredom for me. Gone are the days of rib tickling clean common man comedies like Bawarchi, Chupke Chupke, Chashme Baddoor or even Namak Halal for that matter. Raju Hirani does have that knack but even he's having to include toilet jokes and sexual humor to make his movies viable these days. Perhaps that's what even family audiences want these days!@Fan You want to watch it? @Anuj I can't even make myself mention Chupke Chupke in the same breath as ...@TimELiebe ¯\_(ツ)_/¯@Meeta: I have not yet watched it - got other things higher on the priority list - but I would watch it (most likely will be on TV).  I don't mind such brainless comedy - as long as I go with the right expectations into a movie experience it is alright.The Houseful and Welcome genre are your typical WhatsApp 1-liner jokes or your laugh-in-the-face comedy shows that are mushrooming on Indian TV channels.  Treat each dialogue as a gag and nothing more than that.  These are not movies that you want to remember for a long time, whole purpose is to go in - have enough laugh out loud moments - come out - and forget about it.I do understand that such kind of films do not appeal to everybody.  They are as the cliché goes - for the masses and not for the classes.Overall movie help us to smile. Akshay paly good role with jaq. Other actor and actress also play good role. Must watch it when you feel Stressed.@Meeta - so you don't know WTF Little B is doing these days, either?Lovely....Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.

Parental Guidance:


Violence: Slapsticky slapping around
Language: Mostly clean
Nudity & Sexual content: Skimpily clad women. Mention of pre-marital sex. 
Concept: 3 men have to act as if they are crippled or blind or mute. This leads to some confusion and then some more. 
General Look and Feel: The usual Housefull series brightness and loudness
