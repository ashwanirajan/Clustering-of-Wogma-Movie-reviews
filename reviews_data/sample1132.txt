wogma rating: Watch if you have nothing better to do (?)
Another outstanding performance by both Rani Mukherjee and Konkona Sen Sharma. But, that's no surprise. And unfortunately, that's not enough either, to mask the ill-defined characters and their unexplained motivations. This is further marred by lousy and lengthy dialogues. The lyrics are good and the music is refreshing, but you don't to watch the movie for that.So, it is a Yash Raj movie. You have learnt to forgive them for the extra tinge of orange and the sharp sounds, the mandatory songs and the unnecessary melodrama. But, if throughout the movie, the one question that nags you is, "Could a real person, seriously react this way to this situation?" then what exactly are you expected to enjoy? We are talking of a movie that claims to be about the 'journey of a woman'.  I refuse to believe that it was supposed to be in the leave-your-brain-home-and-don't-ask-too-many-questions genre. What could have been a celebration of the spirit of a woman, turns into another story of a woman finding ultimate happiness only in meeting an ideal man. It is uncanny how a salute to womanhood ends in men being the goal of their lives. Not to mention that men are shown as a breed who crave sex. So desperate are they that they pay huge sums to have sex with the most remorseful, uninterested women.Let alone the societal issues, the treatment given to the story was also half-hearted. The details were missing. Elements that needed build-up happened suddenly. The outcome of things that were built-up over the movie was resolved within 30 seconds of screen time.  The only redeeming factors were the performances by the two leading ladies - Rani Mukherjee and Konkona Sen Sharma. We have seen both these women do a wide variety of roles, and these particular ones don't stand out from within the standards they have set for themselves. But, that they managed to jerk tears without adequate support from the script or the dialogues is praiseworthy. The dialogues, especially towards the end were so clichéd that it was outright ridiculous. There was this one pause that Abhishek Bachchan takes mid-sentence. You could sense a huge portion of the audience admire their dialogue-predicting capabilities, when he finishes his line. The dialogues were excessive in a couple scenes given to Konkana. I think, left to her own devices, Konkana could have expressed much more with her silences.On the other hand, I was bowled over by the lyrics of the songs. Especially, "nistabdh khadi hu mein" and "Kachi kaliyaa". The music was refreshing because it was different. Now, whether or not the songs deserved time of their own on the screen is a different question altogether.The camerawork was average. No in-the-face camera or annoying movements except for a few scenes here and there. In fact, there were a couple of very well-done scenes depicting the emotional state of the character. Unfortunately, they did not go with the rest of the film because the technique did not continue in the rest of the movie. What amused me was the huge compliment the cameraperson paid to Abhishek Bachchan and Rani Mukherjee in the song that was supposedly shot in Switzerland. Just imagine, they had all the scenic beauty in the world to capture and they focused mainly on close to mid-shots of the two-some. Or did they do that to avoid being criticized of favoring the Alps too much? Or could it be because it was not Switzerland at all? The rainbow shot towards the end of the song looked like use of blue screen. If it wasn't, then that's a bigger shame, isn't it? Imagine all that money spent and the effect is that of a blue screen.Better defined characters and even better defined motivations would have taken this overall interesting plot a long way. But, alas, that is a lot to ask for.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Warning: this section has some details that could distort your experience while watching the movie. I strongly recommend reading this only after you have seen the movie or if you have decided not to see it.The Sahay family is in a precarious financial condition. The older daughter, Badki (Rani Mukherjee) of the family, decides to do what it takes to make ends meet.The Sahay family is in a precarious financial condition. The older daughter, Badki (Rani Mukherjee) of the family, decides to do what it takes to make ends meet.
Rani Mukherjee's outfit on the set of a movie. Bindi on a jeans and long shirt. Fit the bill very  well.

Watching Yash Raj Films' songs has started feeling like déjà vu. "Hum to aise hai bhaiyya" felt a lot like "dhadak dhadak" from Bunty aur Bubly. "Zara gunguna le" looked a lot like "chak de" from Hum Tum. Can't we be a little more creative?
It's amazing how these girls from small towns are trend-setters with their short kurtis and patialas.
Since when does a mother laugh at her daughters' mischievousness in visiting a prostitute's den? And since when are prostitutes invited to weddings?
The Sahay household's kitchen was a bad set. It looked too obviously artificial.
The downpour when the characters are in a turmoil. Too clichéd, done way too often.
Vivaan(Kunal Kapoor)'s exaggerated clumsiness in the scene in his office cabin. Not funny. And certainly not nice.
The whole premise that if Badki (Rani Mukherjee) came to the wedding people would talk. Wouldn't people talk more if she didn't come for her sister's wedding?
Was Jaya Bachchan unable to emote her feelings when she was crying towards the end of the movie? Why did she have to hide her face in that scene?
The set of the balcony in the climax. Again too artificial.
Why have a sub-plot related to troublesome uncle and cousin when you are not going to end it with a punch? It’s resolution was the lamest ever.

The silky, shiny white shirt Rani Mukherjee was wearing just before interval was very unflattering.
The silly mime of a fight in the song "Teekhi teekhi". It was very artificial.
Do girls in Benares really reveal so much cleavage?
