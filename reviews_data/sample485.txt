Aatma has a storyline flatter than Bipasha Basu's waistline. So, you end up having yet another lame horror film, that barely manages to spook you. Aatma - another horror film on the horizon? This is getting a bit much, isn't it? One horror film a week. If there were any room left to be immune to the typical horror movie spook tactics, it'll be taken care of if horror films are released at this rate. 
I realise, there is a very high chance of Aatma being different from the regular Hindi horror flick though. Hats off to the person who thought of Bipasha Basu and Nawazuddin Siddiqui as a couple! I was stumped at that. In addition, you did wish death upon Bipasha Basu's character in Raaz 3. This time she's on the other side of the table. She's going to be the typical woman being spooked in almost every other horror film.   The angle here is a little different. Other than Nawazuddin Siddiqui playing a spirit, the mother-daughter-father equation sounds extremely intriguing. The music seems to have garnered mixed responses. Hopefully, the newer elements in the horror genre will make Aatma worth a watch. Music Reviews:
Apun Ka Choice - "2.5/5"
glamsham - "4/5"
koimoi - "3/5"
Milliblog - "The Haldipur brothers deliver in style in their well-deserved solo soundtrack."
Music Aloud - "7.5/10"

  Aatma leaves you with many questions. Why are most horror films all the same? Why are they oh-so-lame? Why do they have to involve an artist who's a child? Are horrified adults too mild? These are not rhetorics, they are genuine questions. Aatma starts out, right from the trailers, with the premise of a dead dad wanting to be with his child. Aatma stays there pretty much right till the end. There is very little in terms of movement from this baseline. Sure, there are doctors, priests and murders, but they are pretty much predictable. And what's a horror film going to horrify you with, if you know what's going to happen next. Without that as a support, the audience has to more or less rely on the performances to feel for or against the characters. Nawazuddin Siddiqui does invoke disgust and anger even before he's shown on the screen. However, taking nothing away from his acting effort, those negative emotions are more directly correlated with the characterisation. Again, once it is invoked, it stays put. You cannot but ignore the fact that there was a decent chance of revealing his intentions gradually, thus building the drama to a high. But well, they let that cat out in the promos itself. Bipasha Basu does the drill of being a very scared, concerned mother. But, she can do only so much if the screenplay has her sleep away from her child who seems to be in fatal danger. At the risk of revealing a little detail, the said scene has Bipasha Basu's Maya sleep with her mom and be comforted by her and the daughter-in-danger is sleeping in another room! And what about our concern for our child artists? Should any human be put through the ordeal of acting in roles that require them to be possessed and murder people brutally (Doyel Dhawan) - at age 6! And this is not specific to this film, or even just Hindi films, why should any child be put through first giving those performances and then watching themselves on the screen. What kind of a messed up race are we, if we need to use the tenderness of age to entertain us? (I can only hope that the said artists aren't allowed to watch such of their films until they are of age. But, I know that is highly unlikely.)And the sad part is, it doesn't even spook us. We've seen it so many times over that we are now immune to possessed children. Oh well.I am nit-picking then when I point out a "Whhaat?" moment, when I see a school teacher sitting on her desk, while teaching - one-leg-over-another in a short skirt! Yeah, petty me. If I had to pick one positive in the entire film, it would be attempt at mood. The gloomy blues create the right atmosphere, even if it is pretty dark during day time. However, the background music and all the other elements bring the film down to below average. So, a courtesy tip towards science and God later, the film and your miseries end. Aatma is short, and even if it is certainly not sweet, you thank the writers for small mercies.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Dunno why Nawaz chose this one of all after his sensational acts in Kahaani and GOW last year! Just hope this one doesn't turn out to be like those Vikram Bhatt comical horror films!@Anuj it's something different, no? It is not like the Bhatt films, but that doesn't mean it is a good film either. :Dmeetu,,,,i dont why are u so rude with this movie,,,,i m not saying that its a good movie but atleast u have chossen 'watch if u have nothing better to do' its better than the recent  RGV and bhatt horror movie,,,,if gives a hope that decent horror movies can be made in future of bollywood@meetu: I highly disagree with your review this time meetu..Tell me what else u expect from a horror flick?? This was pretty good then vikram bhatt's stupid horror series..Iam fillowing u from past 2 years but this time I disagree..@Anup and @Jake the movie was just too flat for me. Hardly anything happened that wasn't expected from the trailers. Not a singly jolted me or gave me the creeps. And like with any horror film which uses child artists to get possessed or possess, it is an instant negative for me.Aatma is an awesome film, extremely well directed. Sound Effects are top of the line. Performances are great too. Good going team aatma@meetu~ what you want from a horror movie then? and frankly, you're being tooooo rude too this movie.see meetu I m repeating what I have said earlier,,,,its not a good movie but better then raaz 3 , bhoot return and 1920 evil return,,,,and u have rated raaz 3 as 'watch if u have nothing better to do' ,,,, atleast acting and the atmoshphere is better in this movie,,,,so u are rude to this one@ Ishu - Thank you for appreciating the Sound Effects. A lot of hard work had gone into designing each & every sound for the film & making sure it blends completely with the Visuals.@Jake @Anup To each his own.
