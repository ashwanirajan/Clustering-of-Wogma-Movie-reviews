Does one redeeming factor count? Even if they bore you till they get to that point?Another cookie-cutter film from the Bhatt stock house. Does making the protagonist invisible really change things much? He is still a spirit, right? He is still going to kill the bad guy for some or the other reason, right?Just nothing rings above average about Mr. X's promos. Including the music. Music Reviews:
Bollywood Hungama – "2.5/5" 
glamsham – "3.5/5" 
Milliblog - "a listenable soundtrack, in Bhatt tradition." 
Music Aloud - "6/10"

  A Bhatt film starring Emraan Hashmi can pique your interest only so much. After what we can call a typical start to a Bhatt-thriller, comes the typical death and inevitable resurrection/revival. The mumbo-jumbo is different, but outcome typical. What is atypical though is the resolution. It makes you sit up and notice, if you have been paying attention thus far, that is. It doesn't help that the actors all seem to be going through the motions rather than emotions. It must be said though that the lead lady's character gets a bit more to do here than your typical film in this genre. The story winds and unwinds way too much in the second half. It is almost as if the intriguing climax was the goal. The events leading up to it had to be convincing given the maze of characters and their motivations. So, whatever it took to get to that end given the constraints was done. On the way you have some decent use of CGI, though I'd have liked to see it in 2D. The prosthetics are pretty awful, the kind that makes you laugh rather than gross you out. At the end, I was a little surprised and a little disappointed. Given the dilemma and the conclusion thereof, the concept deserved better screenplay and writing. Should I be happy then that there seems to be a series on the way? ;)

        ...Given the fact that all of Emraan Hashmi's films have at least one (smash) hit track in them, this film falters in that department as well. The film's music (Jeet Ganguly, Ankit Tiwari) lacks any hit or hummable songs. It's the film's background music (Raju Singh) that manages to hold the film. While the film's cinematography (Pravin Bhatt) is decent, its editing (Kuldeep Mehan) is average. ...

        ...In all, Mr. X comes across as a decent one-time watch, if you choose to reflexively force-shut your ears to some of the soapy dialogues. An important takeaway from the film: Workplace romances are doomed, and will more often than not, get you into trouble. The story is very predictable, but there aren't really those moments when you feel why the film doesn't end. Two for the film, and a half extra for Hashmi. Watch it for Emraan Hashmi...baaki ki chinta chhodo....

There’s an underlying strain in the film of turning Mr X into a superhero and if this were a self-aware comedy, it would have worked fine with the exact same cast. Unfortunately Bhatt believes in rendering films with heart stopping seriousness. The net result is a film that’s awful enough to make you remember Tushar Kapoor’s gem Gaayab as a work of art....

          Instead of giving it a U/A certificate, censor board should've given Mr X a 'C' certificate.
C for chutiya movie.

          Watched Mr. X today. Was surprised to see @thetanmay. And trust me, he acts better that Arunoday Singh. The movie sucks though.

iBollywoodism:
          Saw Mr.X. Even @thetanmay is a supporting actor in it with almost 25 minutes of screen time. U can guess how the movie would be! 1*/5.

AshfaqSoudagar:
          Expected Mr.X will hit bulls eye with average 1st half n boring 2nd half stands out as flop.Bounce back with #HamariAdhuriKahani
        
AllwynFurtado:
          MR. X. is such an amazing movie that it reminded me of ankhen series on durdharshan. I mean shaktimaan had better special effects.

          height of stupidity - Mr X - the film. Emraan should start acting in better movies b4 he becomes Mr X from the Bollywood itself.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Kidhar Mr X mein uljhe hein hum? The trailer for the first true blockbuster of 2015 is out - Dil Dhadakne Do. And by the looks of it, it will continue where ZNMD signed off. Couldn't wait till 5/6.ZNMD in itself was up and down with boring sequences midway through. DDD seems to be even worse. Zoya Akhtar seems to have mastered the art of catering to the sensibility of ultra rich urban NRI indians with flamboyant lifestyles and issues ranging from the colour of their tee to the amount of sugar in their coffee. DDD will do well only among wannabe Brit and American college going and corporate doofuses. For the rest, it would be a bomb!!Haven't find anything boring in ZNMD except some lonely scenes of Hrithik and Katrina. Infect its one of those movies which i have seen twice in the theater . Expections are same.Ditto.  Seen ZNMD in theatres twice.  And not in the same week.  Despite the theatre was full.In fact ZNMD is in the same category as Dil Chahta Hai.  And DDD will follow in the same footsteps.As regards stinking rich and their life-styes, I prefer that then sitting through a Kashyap film on stinking poor and their life-style.  At least for the 2 hours + of the film you get the escapism that Hindi films have always provided.If promos are to be believed (and I usually don't believe them): then Anil Kapoor seems to be in ultra fine form.  And casting a relatively lesser known Shefali in the key role is also a good idea - thereby she does not come with any preconceived perceptions on her character (à la Kiron Kher and her peers).Can't wait.  Let's hope it delivers.And agreed, the targetted audience for DDD are metropolitan youngsters, and upwardly mobile class.  There are no pretensions.  So  I do not expect this film (and nobody should expect it) to rake in the moolah in a remote Bihar or UP village.BTW: Amount of sugar in coffee should be the issue for everybody.  Refined processed sugar is extremely dangerous, as per Ayurveda and even as per all the latest Brit and American experiments and observations.  So if the film tackles an issue like the amount of sugar in coffee then it is an issue of national health importance.Yeah, rich brats in rich exotic locations talking about their noobish ridiculous problems in life which 90% if India does not even care for (ickle candy stuff like college sweethearts) is defined as "escapism" by some cinema watchers. And anyways, at least ZNMD was entertaining in bits and pieces. DDD trailer is plain bland, boring and snoozeworthy with below average actors (except Farhan doing what he does best) making absurd below average ugly facial expressions against pretty locations. I'd rather take PIKU's trailer anyday, anytime (despite the below average Deepika since AB looks in full flow and Irrfan at his usual best). ZNMD was a Hit courtesy its power packed cast and some witty scenes every now and then (the only reason that i could sit through it), DDD would not go beyond an AVERAGE verdict at best. Its gonna be rejected by even the plex audiences for whom it is targeted. PS: Some hypocritical male chauvinists love bogus escapism by a gang of heterosexual pretty boys but when the same "discovery of life" is based on a single female traveller, they call it bogus (Queen anyone?).Its one thing making a film for a particular audience. Its completely another thing for that film to actually be accepted by that same target audience. DCH,ZNMD,Queen,Kahaani etc were made for a particular target audience and got accepted by them with open arms. Dabangg,Rowdy Rathore,Singham,Agneepath etc were made for a different target audiece and they too were accepted by their respective target audience. Byomkesh Bakshi was made for the plex audiences and yet completely rejected by the same plex audience. DDD will go the same way!Talking of ANURAG KASHYAP, he seems to have broken the norm and come up with a BOMBAY VELVET which has got more of an urban touch than some of his other films. Although over-rated Ranbir is always a downer, BV might just be something to watch out for."I prefer that then sitting through a Kashyap film on stinking poor and their life-style." ~ by this utterly laughable and ridiculous logic of a tasteless movie watcher, most AB blockbusters of the 70's portraying him as a slum dweller or an underdog should be "stinking films" and so should the likes of Satya,Parinda and Company. Ironically, the same films watcher calls himself a Rohit [comment deleted partially because it contained a personal attack] fan!If at all film-makers are interested in catering only to multiplex audiences alone (for commercial reasons), I'd rather have them make slick, gripping songless action thrillers like Kahaani & Baby or low budget content based films like Paan Singh Tomar, Jolly LLB & OMG than make large scale big budget commercial films about rich brats in pretty locations dealing with their nooby, childish day to day problems in an attempt to "rediscover life"...total bullMan,this comment section is full of judgemental [comment deleted partially because it contained a personal attack] passing off their opinions as facts.The movies still has 2 more months to come out [comment deleted partially because it contained a personal attack].Pass out your 'Verdict' then.Yeah I also wasn't impressed with the trailer but then I didn't like ZNMD's promos too which I ended up liking.So just keep your 'verdicts' with you till the movie comes out.Man,this comment section is full of judgemental idiots passing off their opinions as facts.The movies still has 2 more months to come out you fools.Pass out your 'Verdict' then.Yeah I also wasn't impressed with the trailer but then I didn't like ZNMD's promos too which I ended up liking.So just keep your 'verdicts' with you till the movie comes out."The movies still has 2 more months to come out you fools.Pass out your 'Verdict' then." ~ as commented by a [comment deleted partially because it contained a personal attack] who almost said the ditto statement before the release of ROY :PThat is just the point I'm making.These bollywood films like Roy and Villain get your hopes up only to disappoint while films like NH10 and DLKH which you are not much interested in turn out to be good.So wait,till the film comes out watch it and then give your opinion.Don't judge an entire film by a 2 minute trailer.And why is everyone here talking about DDD and not the biggest movie of the year coming out this friday???@Gokul :  see my comment  "Let's hope it delivers ". So I  have not made a judgement.  It's Anuj who has predicted the future.  He's as confused as a child with a red and yello lollipop, which one to lick (first).BTW : didn't catch your joke about the biggest block buster releasing on 24/4?@Fan Not a joke dude,Age of Ultron coming out this friday"He's as confused as a child with a red and yello lollipop, which one to lick (first)." ~ desperate attempt at forced sense of humour by a [comment deleted partially because it contained a personal attack] Fyi, thus far every single one of my prediction on this site has been near spot on. Not that i wanna boast, but yeah some [comment deleted partially because it contained a personal attack] need to be shown their worth!@Gokul: OK, I see.  I was on the Hindi film wavelenghth and so started wondering which block buster we are talking about.@Anuj: [comment deleted partially because it contained a personal attack]@Pankha: [comment deleted partially because it contained a personal attack]Cut it off, people. Stop calling each other names. Yes, as juvenile as it may sound calling each other idiot and fool is also name-calling and not nice. Not to mention, the name-calling itself is not a very grown up thing to do in he first place. Same goes for name-calling film cast and crew members. Yes, pea-brained, dimwitted and so on and so forth fall in the same category too. Please stick to discussion about films, trailers, film music, etc. Your abuse-free opinion, even if disagreeable, is accepted here. But not your opinion about other members of the audience. Don't make wogma look like a street fight. With that out of the way, why are Anurag Kashyap films being branded as being about "stinking poor and their lifestyle"Except for That Girl In Yellow Boots, the rest hardly qualify as being about the poor. And the movie not about the poverty. Even the poverty in Gangs of Wasseypur doesn't last very long, right?I am ok with films being about poverty, I was wondering what about Anurag Kashyap films make them seem like they are about the poor.@Meetu:  in Hindi we have a saying, laaton ke bhoot baaton se nahin mante.  Unless you speak with Anuj in the language he understands, the message does not pass through.  As simple as that.  Check out all the threads of Anuj and one would notice that he starts off on an unpalatable tangent as soon as he does not agree on a point of view.  So one needs to bring out the ludicrosity of his statements by beating him at his own game, otherwise he does not understand.@Fan Really? You think anyone takes a point well after you've called them names? In my experience, that only aggravates them into misbehaving with more fervor. Anyway...whether it is one of the lot or all of us, let us just refrain from personal attacks and focus on discussing what we love and what brings us together - films!ha ha ha...just read this tweet, thought it was relevant.@Meeta : Lol...u really wanna be taking a sarcastic tweet by a user by the name of "Bollywood G****" with utmost seriousness and relevance? :PCopyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
