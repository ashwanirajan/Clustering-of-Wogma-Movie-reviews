wogma rating: Watch if you have nothing better to do (?)
Dum Maaro Dum makes a crime thriller as disinteresting as it could be. The lines are limp and the situations are far from creative. The plot is strung together with a  series of events that have no flow.There used to be a time when I looked forward to an Abhishek Bachchan film, those were the days of Bluffmaster and Kuchh na Kaho. There was something very slick about his stylish walk and the pauses in his dialogue deliver. Now the very same things have become a drudgery. 

One argument could be that his roles all require him to be suave and that's how a suave Abhishek Bachchan is. For, he did do things differently in Paa, Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Se, Raavan. But that still doesn’t take away the apprehension when you see the trailer of Dum Maaro Dum, what with a cop doing rap. I for one loved the rap he did in Bluffmaster. Anyway hopefully, this one is just a promo video and will have no place in the film. 
I hope so mainly because, the film could have decent content. One because I liked Rohan Sippy's earlier do with Abhishek Bachchan (as if you hadn't figured it out yet). Also a deeper look into the nexus of Russian drug-dealers that has a strong hold in Goa's underbelly, sounds really interesting. It actually exists, no wonder the Goan government is objecting to the release of the film - "It puts Goa in bad light".
An interesting concept with stylish execution might be the perfect ingredients for a  thriller. I mean, just check out those ants walking up, how cool is that! But Amit Roy's cinematography has been known to annoy. Hopefully he will fare better under the hands of a different director. Morever there is the  new sound mixing system to look forward to. Hopefully, it is appropriately used. 
I'm sure the songs will sound fantastic in the new Dolby system. For one, I didn't have that much of a problem with the title song as others did on twitter. Unfortunately, I am certainly disappointed by Jaideep Sahni's lyrics. Here is what other's think about the music -

  It's nice to see a film-maker, whose focus is 'style', trying to talk about the victimized middle class. He tries to say that their only hope against their helplessness is by taking responsibility and trusting no one but themselves. Sounds too deep and dark for a mainstream film? Well worry not, the film doesn't take itself that seriously because it is made up of some of the most ridiculous lines and has situations taken straight from the mafia films in the 90s. Only that present day Jeevan seems to be Aditya Pancholi.

Can it get any sadder than that? Yes, it can.
The hour-long, pre-interval screen time is spent only in set-up. It introduces its 5-6 main characters and lays out the situation - none of which you can care about because there is zero attempt by any character to connect with me AND there is nothing compelling about the story so far.
Whatever happens after that has to work twice as harder to become interesting. An uphill task that only gets steeper. While most of the moves, twists and turns are predictable, there are actually a few events that took me by surprise - more like "wow, they actually did that in a Hero-oriented, Hindi film" than "whoa! Didn't see that twist coming! Cool!!"
The only thing "cool" about the film is the conceptualization of some of the scenes, in terms of post-production work, including editing. Rest is all blah comes and bigger blah goes. No, lines trying too hard to be cool dialogue don't count. That is, throwing in 'facebook','twitter','google' in a line won't make it hip and popular.
That "Abhishek Bachchan" attitude has worn off long-long ago. What's the point of a pause in a sentence, if you can predict when it's going to come because you know the actor so well now? Prateik Babbar doesn't look one bit like the seventeen year old he plays. He tries to whine like one though. Rana literally looked like a block of moving wood which would making grunting, squeaky voices every once in a while. Bipasha Basu's role has absolutely nothing important about it.
At some level, I guess the roles of everyone other than ACP Kamath (Abhishek Bachcan) were meant to create pathos for the plight of the Goan middle-class population stuck between a corrupt administrations and drug dealers. But, it just doesn't get there. 
It'd also have been interesting to see a couple of things explored further, for example, Kamath's misjudging people, or a misused woman's internal struggle. But that would be out-of-tone depth for such a superficial film. I mean, we are talking about an Additional Commissioner of Police breaking into rap while cleansing the streets of Goa. Where's the room for complexity and profundity here?
Story-wise whatever there is to see in the film, you've already seen in the promos of the film or in a film from the 80s-90s. The only marvel is the use of color and light and the visual treatment given to some of the scenes.

sandeshgoa:
          Dum Maro Dum is real Dumdar film exposing Goa's drug racket. Absolutely no Dum in opposition arguments. Made themselves laughing stock. Pity

          Dum Maro Dum has a good story line fraught with third class cinematography and acting. Irfan or KK Menon should have replaced Bacchhan.

iJefin:
          the ending of the movie was not so cool.. 2nd half of the movie is dull. Final Verdict: Dum Maro Dum is a one time watch.
        
iamindra_nil:
          Dum Maro Dum- accha hai. Remember sanjay dutt-anil kapoor starrer "Musafir"? To me DMD is a cocktail of Musafir & Dhoom. Watch it for Rana.
        
harshverma:
          #Dum Maro Dum: Good effort gone waste to poor finish. Brilliant cinematography, fast paced 1st half, and surprisingly good act by @AB Junior

          Dum maro Dum over dosed with drugs yet technically brilliant.

          AB Jr looks good in Dum Maro Dum but only cus he's surrounded by Rana and Bipasha. My wooden chair acts better. Movie's pretty average.

          Dum Maro Dum is not as bad as I expected. Abhisekh excels at such do-or-die cop roles, which r definitely better than Raavan any day!

LaBh1:
          I can't tell if this agonizing headache is because of the live IPL match last night or the movie Dum Maro Dum #Vacation has been Undone
        
khunal:
          No dum in dum-maro-dum. From performance, to script, to direction, everything ordinary.

: Stylish but obvious *policier* with morally ugly "hero" and annoying flashback structure.
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.ACP Kamath (Abhishek Bachchan) is made in-charge of making Goa drug-free. His endeavours with drug peddlars, warlords and unsuspecting, innocent bystanders who are caught in the drug-web.ACP Kamath (Abhishek Bachchan) is made in-charge of making Goa drug-free. His endeavours with drug peddlars, warlords and unsuspecting, innocent bystanders who are caught in the drug-web.
The very basic plot of a corrupt police-officers sudden urge to do good.
Mercy's story around his name.
Just a 4-man army to cleanse Goa of its drug problems? Really now?
The whole suspense around Michael Barbossa and the repetition - just didn’t arouse any curiosity at all. 
The party scene between Aditya Pancholi and Abhishek Bachcan - what did it achieve?
looking forward to see Deepika Padokone's item number on big 70 mm...she looks pretty hot in this oneW8ing for this film... hope it will rock.... :Pit is the best movie in recent days...fabulous direction,,,AB Jr is back...superb dialogues...and thanks to superb climax,,,thrilleri am shocked! I can't believe that the movie went so bad.but i will sure watch it,hope i won't be that dissapointed .I have not seen the movie yet but even though I would not disagree with your views I would still watch it because I am bored of cricket for last 2-3 months!@guddu so what did you think?@nicky but this one did neither, no?@bolly ha ha ha...there's a reason!@Mohan uhhh...both?@Wogmafattymeetu hilarious username! ha ha ha hawhy was i so much excited about it? cause Sriram as a script writer or the beard boy abhishek.i forgot one thing bipasha basu who has never given a hit since no entry. Damn if i had taken ur advice,i am now drolling for my money and my time wasted for this.i will never watch a film until i have full faith on every single cast and crew.@guddu it's ok. happens. life hai. :P :PI heard songs only,Nice composition from pritam. yet to see this movie and i have good hope about abhishek. Wait and see.Dipika's dance sizzler was no match for bad script...this movie has all the ingredients in it to make it fail.@TimELiebe "A hole in the time-space continuum" - ha ha ha...that's a good way to describe Dum Maro Dum. :)I loved the last analogy. :) you sound mighty annoyed. "has there ever been a more whiny, obnoxious little punk than the supposed "kid" whose endless flashback opened up the movie?" - Are you talking about the actor here or the character?::Are you talking about the actor here or the character?::Once again - no e-mail for follow-up comments. :(The character, Meetu - I don't know Prateik Babbar's(?) other work well enough to judge offhand. I gather he was also Meow's annoying kid brother in JAANE TU YA JAANE NA, which doesn't bode well for his future roles!Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
