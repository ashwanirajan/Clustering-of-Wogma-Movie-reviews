wogma rating: Watch when on TV/online (?)
Table No 21 is the kind of thriller that makes you feel you are smelling a fish through out.  The "Something ought to be wrong, I just don't know what." turns into a regular twist in the tale without throwing you off balance. The social message shoved down your throat in the end doesn't help the film's cause either.A married couple, very much in love with each other, is pulled into playing a online reality game along the lines of The Moment of Truth. Interestingly enough, the Indian version of the game, Sacch Ka Saamna was hosted by the hero of Table No 21's, Rajeev Khandelwal. Anyway, the idea, of a couple having to complete a task related to the question just answered - a truth and dare of sorts - is very engaging. Unfortunately, it all ends up being very much as expected and is topped off with a social message.My concern with films with social message is that an audience like me needs no convincing. I'm already on the story-teller's side of the issue. The people who need to watch the film are the one's who commit the crime. And even if they were to watch a film like this, would that make a difference in their behavior. Even powerful films might not have that effect, and Table No 21 isn't even hard-hitting enough. So, what's the point? Sorry, talking about the kind of crime in question would be giving the movie away.Table No 21 doesn't come off as strong enough, despite some grueling stuff that the protagonists/antagonists go through, because you don't quite connect with the characters. You know they are grey and that's a brilliant thing in today's world of black and white characters in Hindi films. Yet, you don't feel for them even when they are going through some of the most mentally cruel ordeals. Their happiness and sorrow seems fake.Some of the disconnect also seems to be because of the order in which the tasks pan out. Instead of escalating into more rigorous and painful ones. So after having gone through a major ordeal the couple's dilemma seems fake when there is a relatively simpler one comes after that. Sure, some of them are more symbolic tortures than others, yet the symbolic pain seems artificial. That in turn, could be because of some very functional performances by Rajeev Khandelwal and Tena Desae. Paresh Rawal trying to be his devilish best, doesn't help. Paresh Rawal's character's sidekick provides unintentional laughter while trying to look all ominous.So, yet another potentially interesting story falls prey to mediocre execution. Yet another topic of concern in the country sees a film that is made with all the right intentions and a lot of heart, but comes across as contrived and forced.

          Paresh Rawal turns a lot of tables in Table No. 21..if only d story was as heavy as him..`Nice` way to end the film..#MustWatch for his fans

          Table No. 21 was quite ok for one time. Interesting 2nd half as story unfolds. 1st was slow & could've helped by adding scenic Fiji.

          Table no 21 was interesting. Some chinks in the story line. But it's at least got an unusual plot.
        
amankhurana91:
          Table No.21 is all about Paresh Rawal. Everything else looks too plain in his presence. Not more than a one-time watch! Full review soon!
        
AkashUpadhye:
          Table No 21 may not be the perfect start to 2013 we were looking for, but it’s a well-paced thriller with some highs and quite a few lows

          Though not spectacular, " Table No. 21" is decent enough.

          Hahahaha, Table No.21 - such a ridiculous movie. The best acting came from two side-actors who were there for some 10 minutes.

          Okay so just saw this "Table 21" movie. First half was good, but by the end it completely loses control. Wouldn't be worth paying to watch!

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Meetu it seems you were quite delighted by the film's premise irrespective of the treatment and the acting , well your review has now lured me to watch this movie now, let's see how bad it is !! :)@guddu At your own risk :PIts a nice review.But u don't share Movie Rating.BTW awsome reviewThanks! Well, the rating is "Even the keen, wait for DVD". I don't do star ratings, if that is what you mean. :)realy i found a new type learing movie in bollywood after huge day ,i thanks to all the team of table21 making this wanderful movie ,dear friends never miss it.....very interesting movie with great message & dramatic climax ..must watch for all youngstersrealy i found a new type learing movie in bollywood after huge day ,i thanks to all the team of table21 making this wanderful movie ,dear friends never miss it.....very interesting movie with great message & dramatic climax ..must watch for all youngstersI quite liked it except for the climax..raging?i mean they could have thought of a thousand more interesting "twists" than this!!As for the social message,this is no Salman Khan film which is gonna be watched by 5 cr people and influence another few crores!This is small scale low budget thriller with a limited audience and as u said correctly,"we don't need any convincing,the one's who do aren't gonna be watching this film anyways"..Paresh Rawal was excellent though.His act starting from a charming resort manager to an evil,sly,suave and venomous host and ultimately the scene of him being a father in agony and grief is definitely worth a watch!Rajeev Khandelwal is a huge disappointment especially after his class act in Aamir.Tena Desae is just there to strip down and show off her well toned body which she manages with ease!A decent one time watch overall.@Anuj :) Yep!Direction: 3    Story: 2.5    Lead Actors: 2.5    Character Artists: 2    Dialogues: 2    Screenplay: 2.5    Music Director: 1    Lyrics: 1Watched the movie on TV, found it timepass if nothing better to do.i thanks to all the team of table21 making this wanderful movieCopyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
