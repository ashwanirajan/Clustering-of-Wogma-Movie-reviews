
wogma rating: Watch if you have nothing better to do (?)
Race 2 is the Dabangg 2 of thrillers. The action brings more 'laugh out loud's than wows. The twists make your tummy churn instead of making your grey cells work. And yet I have this tingling feeling that the film will do well commercially. Why? Just generally. Like my friend described it, "Watch it. Leave it." Didn't they exhaust all the twists and turns in Race? Apparently there is more revenge to be had, more exotic locations to be explored, more races to be begun and finished, more lame dialogue to be delivered and heard. But hey, no new music?Saif Ali Khan and Anil Kapoor return with John Abraham, Deepika Padukone, Jackquline Fernandes, and Ameesha Patel! Ameesha Patel? She is still around? Oh ofcourse, only as Anil Kapoor aka Karamchand's Kitty. That makes sense, fits in perfectly, in fact. I am hoping to get a couple of genuine laughs because of her.The rest doesn't intrigue at all. But, we shall still watch in the hope that they go a little deeper in emotions or characterization.

  If there is one thing we have learnt from Race it is that you trust no one. No one at all. And that doesn't change in Race 2. Characters make it to Abbas-Mustan's world only if they are conniving. Even the seemingly annoying and trying-to-play-dumb Cherry (Ameesha Patel) is sly in her own way, within her context. This world would have passed of as decent fiction, if only the contrived twists in the tale weren't unending. Each character getting a chance to smirk, "I knew it. You thought you fooled me?" or "I had planted this ploy to put you off-track." gets tiring. If everyone knows everything, what are we watching the film for? To figure out who knows less? The one-upmanship can keep you intrigued only for so long. Can there be a limit to this when one villain claims everything owned by the other villain to be his, because a profit of 5 billion Euros is not good enough? Even in relative terms, that 5 billion is a 33% profit in 2 days! Fine, I shall control the Chartered Accountant in me. Hey, each of the lead characters look like a million bucks. Or make that a few billion. While I can rant and rage about how awfully distasteful the objectification of women is here, and it is loathsome to say the least, I have to admit that gender equality is maintained in the objectification. John Abraham and Saif Ali Khan are bare-chested long enough. And while the others have to just look like they have an alternate plan of double-crossing on their mind, John Abraham does manage to create that extra amount of scare, for he makes the character he plays, Armaan Malik, look like he'll stop at nothing. If only there was some oomph added in terms of good, memorable dialogue or if the characters were given a little more depth, it would have given something for people like me to chew on. Unpredictability which seems like it exists only to increase the run-time of the film, hasn't done its job well. The chase sequences, the fight (boxing) sequences, the scenic beauty of various exotic locations are all captured very well - right from the close-up of a scorpion to the scorpion shaped party deck to the aqueduct to the mountainous beauty of Europe. But, what's with the shoddy graphics work? From the bullet that leaves a sniper's gun to the airplane in the sky - all one botched up job after another. Unfortunately, there is no X-factor in the songs either. They just all look the same - not just to each other in the film, but across films of this genre which carry glitter, glamour and gleam with pride. No novelty whatsoever.Beautiful looking people with twisted minds. Beautiful locations with crime and more crime. Yet, the potentially beautiful duality gets repetitive and tedious. And as if you hadn't guessed it already, the director duo have given themselves scope to fix it at the third go. Yes, I know not why, but I still hope. Maybe because I hope that some day Saif Ali Khan or Anil Kapoor will wake up from their stupor and will want to deliver quality products they are capable of producing.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Expecting a full on Abbas Mustan potboiler complete with over the top dialogues,cheap thrills,backstabbing,double crossing,exotic locations and lots of sleaze.Highly recommended for people who do not watch too much of hollywood.For the one's who do,they'd know that this one's gonna be another rip-off.Great box office prospects for this one,especially among the masses.John will excel in this one i'm sure.Its tailor made for him.The dialogues in the trailer sounded extremely lame and ott.They're like a crossbreed of Dabangg and Don and end up in no man's land!!Expecting a full on Abbas Mustan potboiler complete with over the top dialogues,cheap thrills,backstabbing,double crossing,exotic locations and lots of sleaze.Highly recommended for people who do not watch too much of hollywood.For the one's who do,they'd know that this one's gonna be another rip-off.Great box office prospects for this one,especially among the masses.John will excel in this one i'm sure.Its tailor made for him.The dialogues in the trailer sounded extremely lame and ott.They're like a crossbreed of Dabangg and Don and end up in no man's land!!@Anuj it is crystal clear what you are expecting the film to be like! :DI'm with @Anuj on this one, Meetu. It's going to be big-budget trash with elaborate musical numbers - but then again, I like big-budget trash with elaborate musical numbers! Just park your brain and enjoy the Lifestyles of the Rich and Crooked, the skimpy outfits on the ladies (and John Abraham) shaking their groove thangs, and Saif Ali Khan smirking knowingly as he wanders through it all....@TimELiebe aaye aaye aaye...To each his own... *sigh*The reason i enjoy films like Dabangg/Singham/Agneepath etc are because they are unpretentious and naturally "desi" masala films.Films like Don-2,Dhoom-2,Race etc come across as wannabe's and end up appearing like b-grade versions of Bond/MI films.I'd rather have film-makers sticking to their roots and making stuff like Dabangg/Agneepath than trying to make desi versions of Hollywood films with 1/10th the budget and much inferior technology!Exactly what I accepted from abbas mastan. Time to retire.Must be tiring to see mindless nonsense like this nearly each weekend! Here's to hoping that the coming weeks bring along something better.And please, fix this rating issue. I again said "I am not interested in watching this movie". Definitely not a thumbs up!"While I can rant and rage about how awfully distasteful the objectification of women is here, and it is loathsome to say the least, I have to admit that gender equality is maintained in the objectification. John Abraham and Saif Ali Khan are bare-chested long enough." ~rofl..you're excellent with your words!Btw,whom did u prefer watching between Saif and John? :P@Anuj Thank you. And uhh...both please. :)@Deepak :) If only wishes were horses...@Rahul Some how I don't get tired of watching films :D And sincerest apologies for the rating bit, my husband and wogma's CTO is working on it as I type this comment ;) Hopefully all will be in order in a couple of hoursIt could be worse, Meetu - you would be < href="http://www.avclub.com/section/tv/">reviewing American cop shows for The AV Club. Most of them are every bit as laughably cynical and stupid as RACE 2 sounds (and yeah, I remember the constant "I outsmarted you - !" "No, I outsmarted you MORE!" from RACE as well), only nobody ever does an elaborate dance number in the middle of an episode! And those few times we do, like on COP ROCK or VIVA LAUGHLIN? I think the worst Bollywood songs I ever heard (probably from TANU WEDS MANU) sound wonderful in comparison. Seriously, I appreciate all the effort you and your team go into reviewing Indian movies - and major Western movies that make it to Indian cinemas. It's opened my eyes to all that's out there, and to looking at film from a different perspective - even if I do still have a much bigger love of dopey musical comedies than you do. :)Hey Meetu, I know Abbas Mastan movies are low on IQ but what is the profit you are talking aboutt? Aditya Pancholi gave 15B and was getting back nothing. The whole 20B was replaced by fake bonds.@Meetu:Off topic,but which are your favorite Abbas-Mustan films?I remember watching some good stuff of theirs as a kid in the esrly 90's(namely Khiladi and Baazigar in particular)Finally watched the film. The problem is that unlike Race-1,here the twists and backstabbing is all very stale and predictable.Race-1 though being fake and pretentious at least was enthralling courtesy all the "funny business" that was going on behind the back.This one's too stale and low on entertainment. @Meetu : Didn't get 2 points here1.How does Jacqueline's dress get ripped off after the fencing sequence with Saif?2.What happens to John Abraham in the end? Is his last dialogue an indication to a third installment in the Race franchise(i seriously hope not)?@TimELiebe :) whatever works :)@pragya As I remember, he doesn't know that when he comments about the profit. @Anuj hmmm...let's see. I remember liking Khiladi. Didn't enjoy Baazigar that much. Actually, I liked Badshah, but it could be just because that was the NRI effect - a span when I watched very few Hindi films and would miss home at the drop of a hat. In the same vein I liked Humraaz, within a year of moving back.ha ha ha...he has made moves in such a way that he slits her outfit without harming her. :POh that's a yes! :(Direction: 1.5    Story: 1.5    Lead Actors: 2     Character Artists: 1    Dialogues: 1    Screenplay: 1.5    Music Director: 1    Lyrics: 0.5Well, saw Race 2 finally - and the plot was so twisty and all over the place that I think SRK's Don would have pinched the bridge of his nose and muttered, "Chill, Dude! Even I can't keep track of who's betrayed who any more...."It was fun enough in a Stupid Insulting Movie Logic and Physics kind of way - though when you're welcoming Anil Kapoor's comic relief turns as a sarcastic ex-cop facilitator wooing his ditsy assistant by insulting her all the time you kind of know the story and actors are not up to snuff. Three weeks after seeing it I can't even remember most of the plot, or who (besides Anil Kapoor) was a good guy/gal and who was a bad one.@TimELiebe Looks like you are going through the movies rated worst on wogma :PCopyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
