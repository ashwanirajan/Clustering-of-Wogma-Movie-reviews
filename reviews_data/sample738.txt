Force is a perfect masala film, which also means, it is perfectly predictable. And yet, Force keeps you engaged. It has everything in the right proportion - romance, action, drama. But it doesn't have that one overwhelming factor which can make me recommend it to you without any reservations. I have to add caveats like, if you are into hard-core action, if you like borderline genuine romance, if you don't mind the two interrupting each other, then watch it for sure. There is nothing exciting about an action film. For example, from the trailer it looks like none of the action elements will have anything we haven't seen in Hollywood before. Well, Hollywood these days, hardly has anything that we haven't seen in Hollywood before. Besides, the 2.5-minute trailer of Force itself gives away the entire set-up of the film. My estimate is, that covers the first hour of the film or so. Which means, the action, the romance, the fun will have to make double the effort to engage. My bet is that it won't. Considering the romance and fun bit require good timing and neither John Abraham nor Genelia D'Souza can be appreciated for their acting skills from the films they've done so far. So, unless there's a 180-degree turn hidden there somewhere, there is barely anything to look forward to. The only thing that might make me give Force a fair chance, actor-wise, is the films John Abraham chooses every once in a while. But I have my reservations about this one. 
Add to that the list of films produced by Vipul Shah and you have clichéd, typical Bollywood masala written all over the film. Again as proven by the peep we get through the trailer. 
Amongst all these negative vibes, there is one small reason to have hope though. Director, Nishikant Kamat's ventures so far. I've heard a lot of good things about Dombivli Fast and I remember having an overall positive feel about Mumbai Meri Jaan. So, in short, there is hope. Meanwhile, the music seems to be just about lukewarm.

  If you made a list of things that an ideal action-romance film should have. Force would have checkmarks in all the boxes. 

Good vs. Evil
Strong action-packed sequences
Breathers from the action - emotional /comic scene, or in our Hindi parlance a song
A believable romance
Functional sidekicks
A dreaded villain
So on and so forth.
When you consider the overall package, it isn't a film that you HAVE to rush to the theater to. It's a good-looking film which balances the tightrope of narrating a story with simplicity and fulfills its "commercial" obligations. But, it misses out on having that something extra - call it a zing, call it a soul. 
As I write these words, to my own eye I come across as a slave-driver who expects the world out of her movies. But, there is something out of place, when I am making a checklist and thinking aloud, "everything is there, then why did it feel so choppy, so functional?" 
The generic treatment given to Force is rather clinical. But, there are scenes that work. Some action sequences are grueling enough to make you want them to stop. The romance has a couple of genuine moments, as in you can see why these two are falling in love with each other, the gap that they fill in each other's' lives is clear. The villain is intelligent and not some caricatured, over-stylized "creature". In fact, he is a handsome villain. I don't remember the last time a villain could have passed off as the hero. 
Which also means the casting is perfect. And that's not limited to Vidyut Jamwal who plays Vishnu - note the irony - the destroyer of all things good, the villain. John Abraham couldn't have been cast better. He has to play an honest Asst. Commissioner of Police who has no family or friend ties because he wants to focus on his work. So single-minded is he in his work that, he is called sookha jhaad - a dead tree. And if there's anyone in the industry who can play a dead tree, John Abraham is the man! And no, there is no sarcasm here. I say this with utmost sincerity that this was perfect casting. His muscles make him drool-worthy and the grit on his face makes him a great, rigid police officer. Genelia D'Souza passes off as a breath of fresh air that she needs to be in such a sullen environment. But, nothing anyone else couldn't have carried off neither something we haven't seen her do earlier. 
That Force is a perfect, typical masala film is both its strength and its weakness. You enjoy it while it lasts, but it doesn't linger on any of your senses. When good people die, you feel bad, but your heart doesn't reach out to them. When evil people die, you are relieved, but you are not that angry at him that you want to see his meat minced. You are engaged in the 2+ hours but you are not involved.

The lighting and the style in which the opening sequence is shot.
The villain's entry.
The chase sequence at the bus depot.

The in-the-face product placement in the first half an hour or so.
The tattoos drawn on John Abraham's arms.
The dialogues spouted by dying characters! Uggh!
