ABCD - Anybody Can Dance is more a bunch of people showcasing their dancing talent and ab control than anything else. The story is just a functional wrap-around the makers' passion for dancing but the dances themselves are like those seen in reality shows.Kay Kay Menon! Oooooh...playing a dance teacher? Wow, really? Oh maybe that's what they mean by 'anybody can dance'. Or maybe he's just playing the dance company's manager. I have hardly ever seen Kay Kay Menon dance, but if he's really playing a dance teacher/choreographer I am already waiting to watch the film.This is despite the fact, the good vs evil seems to be very clear in the trailer itself. Either that is damn good character establishment or the epitome of predictability. So, this must be one of the very few times that a movie interests me even though the story seems to be a run-of-the-mill one, this once an underdog competition one. Other than the presence of Kay Kay Menon, the credit goes to watching people dance for two hours. The music seems to be widely appreciated as you can see below. Also, I absolutely loved the last dance sequence in F.A.L.T.U which was also directed by Remo D'Souza.Interestingly, the promos at least don't have a prominent lead lady. For a dance film, that seems a little off. I hope it is used to the advantage of the story. Music Reviews:
Bollyspice - "4/5"
dunkdaft - "ABCD packs a punch that is able to make anybody, dance. "
IBN Live - "4.5/5"  
    - meeta, a part of the audience
  ABCD - Anybody Can Dance has Gopi (Ganesh Acharya) tease Vishnu (Prabhu Deva) "You want to make a Lagaan?", when Vishnu expresses that he'll train some good-for-nothings from a slum area compete in a TV dance show. Within context, it is funny. As the movie progresses you realize Remo D'Souza actually made Lagaan cum ChakDe! India cum 3 Idiots. Unfortunately, not in terms of quality of narrative, but only in terms of the themes touched upon. This when all he actually wanted for ABCD - Anybody Can Dance to do is express his love for dance. Also, if there are so many choreographers interested in making a film about dancing, why can't we have a full-blown musical?Unfortunately, the dances here come across as aerobic and gymnastic routines, with a little yoga thrown in. Except for the extravaganza in the end, it's a true spectacle. Isn't dance a lot more about grace than being able to contort your body into twists and turns. For the joy of watching dance, I'd happily watch Madhuri Dixit in all her elegance or Sri Devi mimic Michael Jackson, even if it's just for half a minute.Fortunately, on the other hand, I knew what to expect. So, if you are a fan of Prabhu Deva kind of dancing, you are in for a treat. Even if a lot of the sequences look like they might be inspired from something already done elsewhere. However, I would think to showcase actual talent in dancing, shouldn't there have been many more long shots? Sure, the final dance is spectacular, yet it is nowhere close to the one in F.A.L.T.U or that in Aaja Nachle. Also, F.A.L.T.U had much more of a story than ABCD - Anybody Can Dance. While the twists in the end added an element of surprise, they fail to tug your heart the way they could have. There is so much dance to be showcased that there is no room for the characters to build a connect with you. At least, not enough for you to go beyond the obvious good vs evil. Other than that too, there were a few things that I liked about ABCD's story - the tight slap between a father and his son, the fact that Vishny eventually has no love interests to distract us from the main story. But, the typical character turn-arounds in the end nullify the things going for ABCD.However, ABCD if taken as a display of current-day dancing, is quite enjoyable. If only, it stuck to its title. When you say Anybody Can Dance, I would have wanted people like me, who have two left feet and are extremely conscious about it, to dance. But, it's ultimately, people who can dance, can dance.

sachinchatte:
          If you've ever enjoyed shaking a leg then Anybody Can Dance is a time pass film. Prabhudeva is a treat to watch, his dancing that is.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.This movie will rocks. Dance and songs are beautiful. Never be bored. I think 3D effects will be great from some shots of Trailer of movie.The trailers are reminiscent of 'Take the Lead' and 'Step up'... even so... looking forward to watching PrabhuDeva in action :)@Nikhil Yeah, it will be interesting to see a dance film in 3D. Hope we don't lose out on the colors.@Pooja Yep!Direction: 2.5    Story: 2    Lead Actors: 2    Character Artists: 2    Dialogues: 2    Screenplay: 2    Music Director: 3    Lyrics: 2@Meetu : Is it worth watching in 3D?I thought the movie was fairly entertaining, esp. for Kids, with DID background. It was a simple underdog story, not complicated or pretentious. Kay Kay gave a tremendous performance, displaying his versatility in the range of emotions. The Final act was worth the prize of ticket.@Anuj The 3D didn't add any value. However, the last dance's extravaganza was splendid on the theater, and more because of the audience reaction to it.@Paresh For me Kay Kay Menon was made into a caricature. But you are right about the final act. The audience reaction to it was amazing. Though like I say in the review, the one in FALTU worked better for me. There was a theme behind it.Decent movie but very superfluous. Dance lovers (and followers of Zee DID) will love it for sure.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
