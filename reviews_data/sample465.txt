A gang-war is a gang-war is a gang-war. If there was anything else it was too loud to register. Shootout at Wadala, set in the early 80s sets us up for a crime drama with much too much potential for action. The trailer itself points to typical Sanjay Gupta stylisation of fight sequences as John Abraham yells at the top of his lungs.The only intriguing fact remains that the film is based on true life events. The problem though is that as far as films are concerned a mafia film is a mafia film is a mafia film. And when its set in Bombay, it can only be so much different from what we have seen earlier. Then, it all boils down to the atmosphere of the 80s, the dialogue and the manner in which everybody shoots everybody. We saw some gruesome action in Shootout at Lokhandwala. I am expecting nothing less or nothing more than that.Yet, as always, I'm hoping to be pleasantly surprised. Meanwhile, the music seems to have a 80s feel to them, but it hasn't appealed too many. Music Reviews:
IBN Live - "3/5"

  I have noticed, these days, when the decibel level of a film goes beyond a certain level, I tune off. There you go, that's my disclaimer. I tune off so well, that I have to resist myself from a quick nap. Despite this, Shootout at Wadala managed to give me a headache by the end of the film. Or maybe it was because of my attempt at controlling my sleep. Eitherway, Shootout at Wadala is your regular gangwar film where everyone wants to kill everyone else. There is one slight difference in that it tries to talk about the ineptness of the system that creates gangsters out of good people. But the message is too little compared to what you have to sit through in terms of pure noise. Not that it is something very new, in any case.The actors do infuse life into the story that runs on for too long. But, the problem with a film that is so intense in terms of how quickly all the characters get angry, doesn't require too much variety from the actors. But, within what is required of them, they do well. Not that there aren't light moments in the film, but they cater to the kind of people who find a good laugh in abusive language just because it is abusive. The rest of the dialogue is way to filmy with all the mythological, religious and philosophical references. The romantic track, though important to the film is given too much of a step-sisterly treatment.In fact, it looks like more time and energy has been spent on 'item numbers' who appear abrupt despite the fact that they are immediately followed by a horny Manya Surve (John Abraham) at Vidya's (Kangna Ranaut) door. Even so, given my aversion to gore and action for the sake of it, if you do enjoy such fight sequences, you might find Shootout at Wadala worth a watch. Like Shootout at Lokhandwala, this one too has its share of creatively killing people. Ultimately, Shootout at Wadala seems to be the kind of film that will be enjoyed by people who like this mix of moderately gory action, toilet humor and aggressive romance.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.A young man, Manohar Surve (John Abraham) wants to stay away from his brother's world of dons and goons. Unforunately, he is pulled in.A young man, Manohar Surve (John Abraham) wants to stay away from his brother's world of dons and goons. Unforunately, he is pulled in.
Jackie Shroff and Anil Kapoor in one frame. :D

The mythological/historical references.  
That Manohar went from good to bad, just like that. 
That Manohar and the inspector (Anil Kapoor) were exchanging stories. A lame way of bringing in the non-linear element to the narrative. 
A bomb in a school is thrown out of a window to keep the kids safe in the school!! What about the kids under the window?!
Bank-robbers paste their face with sticky tapes instead of wearing a mask/sock! Self-torture?
SMS jokes as humor. 
Random religious references. 
This seems bakwaas.I've seen 3 item song in this film....so far :P*songsEven Shootout AT Lokhandwala had about 3-4 item songs.But for me that movie worked because of the high intensity,fast paced action and the amazing interrogation scenes of Sanjay Dutt and Amitabh Bachchan.Don't quite think this one's gonna have any of that!i dont find john fit for the role his voice doesnt suit the character still will watch@Manik correct.@Anuj Yep!@Rajat he was alright in the film, actually.MeeTu - I want to ask u something,,,,how a gang war movie can be made so that u will like it,,,,or just explain me how could u have made this movie,,,,its the ,,,, u doesnt like some genre ,,,, and u always be rude to them,,,,its a good movie,,,,just the three item songs should have been edited,,,,....I almost 9 out of 10 time follow ur reviews for watching movie but not in case of genre u dont like(horror,crime,action) plz raise ur interest in these genre too,,,,plz plz plz....John vs Vivek....Sanjay vs Anil....take your pick!Sanjay Gupta's films are always style over substance, this movie could have been so much than just being a violent and disdain depiction of early Mafia establishment (Manya Saurve) . the adaptation of S. Hussain Zaidi Dongri to Dubai: Six Decades of the Mumbai Mafia, is undermined with Gupta's over stylized approach , infested with unnecessarily 3 item numbers and some cranky dialogue.  I find the movie quite entertaining but not to that extent that i should laud it.@ANuP Gangs of Wasseypur, GodFather :P I love action films and crime mysteries! They just have to be done well. Horror films - I can give you that. @Anuj :D@guddu yeah, it's the style that takes away from whatever substance it had.In Shootout at Wadala John Abraham is playing the role of Manya Surve who becomes an underworld gangster.After a long time we are seeing an actor in such an intense role and John has played Manya to perfection. John Abraham plays the part with a lot of gusto. What a splendid performance by the actor. Abraham breathes life into the role. From the innocence of his college days to the smoldering look in the eyes of a cold killer , to the raw sexuality of a gangester and his wild lovemaking everthing about him was perfect. The love making scenes with Kangana are important to show that he was attracted to her mentally and physically and loved her. This is a real story so you could not show them running around trees and singing songs. How can people have a problem with the bad language in the movie. That is so stupid. This is an Adults movie and most people use bad language, ....and this was a gangster movie, so tell me which gangster will talk with thehzeeb and politeness. The item numbers are not unncecssary as they are shown at hotels and places the gangsters hang out at and form part osf the backdrop to carry the story forward. The movie is based on the book Dongri to Dubai-6 by S Hussain Zaidi's and he has come out a winner. This movie is excellentJohn Abraham should have done such movies long back. This movie is a blockbuster. John Abraham is one of the rare tall, handsome and well built heroes India has. To see him in such a well directed authorbacked role will be such a delight. And with Sanjay Gupta's stylised touch it will be awesome....can't wait till tommorrow to see this blockbuster of a movie..In in this movie John Abraham is playing the role of Manya Surve who becomes an underworld gangster. If you or any one says that he did not act well then you guys do not know anything of acting at all. You will also then say Amitabh in Deewar, Sunny in Arjun, Nana Pateker in Ankush and Manoj Bajpayee in Satya are all bad actors. After a long time we are seeing an actor in such an intense role and John has played Manya to perfection. John Abraham plays the part with a lot of gusto. What a splendid performance by the actor. Abraham breathes life into the role. From the innocence of his college days to the smoldering look in the eyes of a cold killer , to the raw sexuality of a gangester and his wild lovemaking everthing about him was perfect. And Manya Surve had become a ruthless killer and his lovemaking would be anything but namby-pamby. His lovemaking will be wild and unique. And whether he does push-ups, or you do squats when you are making love... it is entirely up to you... how you do it. Lovemaking is like shitting...some sit on the commode to do it and some squat to do it.. everyone has their own style. But with Manya Surve one thing can be sure is that he would not have been delicate, cultured lover,,,but wild possessive, passionate,carnal ,creature...totally in love with his mate. Some people had a problem with the bad language in the movie. That is so stupid. This is an Adults movie and most people use bad language, ....and this was a gangster movie, so tell me which gangster will talk with thehzeeb and politeness. You say Sanjay Gupta should learn from hollywood cinema.... by the way Gupta in the past used to make Hollywood copies and he was abused by a lot of critics and people like you. But this time all credit to him he has made a movie on the book Dongri to Dubai-6 by S Hussain Zaidi's and he has come out a winner. This movie is excellent.gangs of wassypur is not an acion movie,,,,and the godfather is a legendry movie,,,not every week we can make movie like thatI found the film good, perhaps item songs were overdone I found one thing hard to digest john is shot 11 times and yet he can speak well, even any idea how raju kher survives after being bursted with crackers@Anup Gangs of Wasseypur is a gangwar movie. You asked me about action films...There are tons of action films I like - Die Hard, Terminator, Matrix, XXX, XMen and so on... :D@Silvan yeah, it is things like these that turn me off the film and then to call it inspired from true life. I do not deny that truth is stranger than fiction and in reality just about anything can happen, but somethings are still acceptable and others when repeated across time and characters seem far-fetched.See those all are hollywood,,,,bollywood cant make movies like terminator or xmen,,,,atleast at present its impossible@Anup I HAVE to like a Bollywood action film to be allowed to say that I don't like this Bollywood action film?I love it.Hardcore action packed zordaar movie!Just like its prequel in 2007.Both are 3.5/5 from my side.And yeah Meetu,John's version of Manya is way better than Vivek's Maya.Although that's been nullified thanks to Anil Kapoor's joke compared to Sanjay's brilliance as Shamsher Khan.thats what m saying,,,,this is the bar of action films in bollywood,,,,it has some story,,,some good dialogues,,good performance by actors,,,,nice visual effects,,,,....not a perfect but a decent enough movie for this genre in the recent time....far far better then salmaan khan movies,,,,you should appreciate that....@Anuj :D@Anup oh well, some other time then...pathetic movie ...how can anyone like this ...and how can some one claim it to be based on real incident ... i dont think even gangs/underworld/rowdy people will be so brain less ....may be the director actually is ... even the review doesn't look like a whole hearted attempt ...Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
