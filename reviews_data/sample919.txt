Lafangey Parindey satisfies my urge to see a gripping drama. Deepika Padukone and Neil Nitin Mukesh showcase all the masala, and yet it doesn't become too much for the palate to take. A film jis mein emotion bhi hai d-rrrama bhi hai t-rrragedy bhi hai (a popular dialogue from Sholay which translates to has emotion, drama, tragedy) and comedy and action too - and all in good portions. NOT A REVIEW - Just hoping in the midst of silly captions in the promos there is a nicely made love story in there…The Lafangey Parindey promos greet you with a level of lame no one can be proud of - 'One-shot Nandu', 'He is wild, she is blind', 'He was born to fight', 'She was born to fly', 'He'll teach her to see', 'She'll teach him to love'. (gag at the last one there.) Oh and I spared you the distress caused by some 'mard-dard' line in the beginning. The more I read about Lafangey Parindey, the more worried I got. There was this article about how rotten fish were brought into the set. This was for a scene in which Neil Nitin Mukhesh's character, Nandu is teaching Deepika Padukone's character to see. I am assuming this is by using her other sensory organs. Uhhh...If someone has to use rotten fish to accentuate the sense of smell, isn't their sense of smell beyond repair? I have another question. The story is supposedly set in the underbelly of big-bad Mumbai. And our lady, Deepika Padukone is an ace skater. How does someone not-exactly-affluent get into a sport like skating, that too blind? I can Neil Nitin Mukesh getting passionate about beating and getting voluntarily beaten up, but skating will take some convincing. Ok-ok, I'll get over it! I just hope all my questions and beyond will be answered more than satisfactorily this coming Friday, Aug 20. Unfortunately, one apprehension is just leading me to another. From the initial looks, I'm not too convinced about the casting. Deepika Padukone's frozen-spine posture just doesn't come across as that of a girl who's grown up in the dark streets of Mumbai. Nor does the language sound convincing. And the stills of her dance postures look off, awkward, weird. 
But the hope is that Neil Nitin Mukesh might just fit the bill as the macho who has no clue how to handle his feelings for a girl. His confusion comes through even in the trailers and looks like within the lame lines there are a few endearing moments.
 Also, cringeworthy promos make me worry. I hate going into a film with such baggage. So, I dug a bit further, till I saw some ray of hope. And like always you do find out the thought behind the process. Whether or not I like the film, the people who have worked on it have put in their sweat and blood, their mind, soul, and heart. And no one can take away from that -  I also enjoyed this other unique  promotion technique. Oh yeah and there's supposed to be a liplock to lure us into the theater, Neil's first ever on-screen one at that! The music is by R Anandh, known for is ad-jingles for Limca, and this is his debut album. Music reviews in general have liked the album. Milliblog gives R. Anandh a warm welcome. IBN says the music is entertaining. Rediff finds it irresistibly whimsical. 
Musicaloud loved 3 of the 6 tracks. Hindustan Times calls the album a solid, confident debut. Indian Express finds a different flavor in each song. Glamsham predicts a chartbuster and Megzone can't stop listening to it.

  Sincere aplogies. To the writer, director, and actors for being so apprehensive about Lafangey Parindey. I made some promo-based assumptions that were completely off. And boy, am I glad!! It can be argued that I liked the film because my theories were thrown out of the window. What's done is done. I came out of the theater shaking my head in disapproval at the climax but with a generally happy feeling. And that's how the score stands.

Lafangey Parindey is of course, a to-the-core love story. And there is absolutely nothing extraordinary about the one-line plot anyone would use to describe it. The climax is a forgone conclusion. Also like any of the basic seven stories that exist in the world, it’s how the characters get where they are, their ups and downs that matter. Lafangey ParindeyLafangey Parindey is of course, a to-the-core love story. And there is absolutely nothing extraordinary about the one-line plot anyone would use to describe it. The climax is a forgone conclusion. Also like any of the basic seven stories that exist in the world, it’s how the characters get where they are, their ups and downs that matter. Lafangey ParindeyLafangey ParindeyEach of the characters get what I call, "presence of mind" dialogues - natural, use everyday language, have common-man wit in lieu of filmy-wit. Like some sudden but expected character-transitions are masked under a smart line or two - like a mom who doesn't believe in her daughter's aspirations suddenly calls her daughter phataakaa when she's successful. 
Some of the details in the writing give a nice touch to the second layer of the film. With an overt statement that each character has a person to look up to who they aspire to be like, there is a covert line pointing to the fact that none of the "role models" remain the person they used to be. It's disheartening then that the climax is a major let-down. The signs do start showing post-interval, but the nosedive into blah in the last 15-minutes came as a shocker. Or was it their way of catching us off-guard :)? What was with the sudden rush to wrap it up? 
Anyway, the characters engage you and that's where the film connects with you. Our hero, Nandu is played by Neil Nitin Mukesh, who could easily have passed off for a 'chocolate boy.' But, the writers recognize that this grown-up audience now needs their filmi heroes to be more than that. So, this once, the Mumbai milieu is chosen to add to Nandu's character and make him more palatable (too-sweet leads to diabetics after). And it sort-of, kind-of works. Neil has a range of expressions, which he does really well - confusion, awe, guilt, when he's keeping a secret, and a few more. Outside of this though, his face is frozen. His body doesn't move much anyways. 
Also, this range fits in Nandu's character - he's a hunk from the slums, who uses his muscle for an adrenaline rush and makes some money off that too. He hasn't given his future a thought, but can go from being a boxing fighter to a bar bouncer to what his girlfriend wants him to be, apparently very swiftly. Don't get me wrong, this is not entirely illogical, or out-of -the-blue. It is gradual, and an attempt is made to indicate motivation, albeit not entirely convincing. 
Under the 'not entirely convincing' headline will also be a 'Deepika Padukone in the tapori-world. Like I mentioned in the preview, the tight backbone, the long mane, the stance in general give away that she's not really a girl who lives a lousy life. But she makes up for, or let's make that - tries to make up for that with her attitude. 
Her character is a strong girl who won't take 'no' for an answer even from the Almighty. Yep! A proper mainstream movie made by an ad-film maker for a leading production house has a beefy role for the lead-lady. She has her entire range of ups and downs too. 
I wouldn't have imagined Deepika-Neil as a pair. Somehow, together they look like what aunties at weddings might choose to say about the marrying couple, "He doesn't suit her" or vice versa. But, mainly because of Deepika's performance, they seem connected and you want them to be with each other and live happily ever after. 
The side characters are a mix. You have Kay Kay Menon entering and exiting his role as if he owns the place - the hero's self-appointed caretaker (His make-up is also awesome.) And you have the unbelievable heroine's brother with no soul and mind. Also, the second half unnecessarily shows a couple of caricatured characters.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Warning: this section has some details that could distort your experience while watching the movie. I strongly recommend reading this only after you have seen the movie or if you have decided not to see it.Just like they say, "Nandu (Neil Nitin Mukesh) is wild, Pinky (Deepika Padukone) is blind, he is born to fight, she is born to fly, he teaches her to see, she teaches him to love" Only it has more substance than just that.Just like they say, "Nandu (Neil Nitin Mukesh) is wild, Pinky (Deepika Padukone) is blind, he is born to fight, she is born to fly, he teaches her to see, she teaches him to love" Only it has more substance than just that.
Awesome opening shot!
The locations in Bombay chosen wanted me to see more of Bombay. **sigh**
References to Kala Pathar (a YRF film) and choice of songs playing in the background like 'aage bhi jaane na tu' Kind-of chosen for the situation
The accident scene.
The tone in which Deepika Padukone calls out to her mom the first time she returns home after the accident.
The noise of the dhols killing the dialogue between Nandu and Chaddi, because the audience wasn't supposed to know what their talk was about.
The detail of having a mattress to protect when a beginner falls down while learning how to save oneself.
Neil Nitin Mukesh's acting when he can't believe he's in love.
The fact that the 'reality show' aspect wasn't delved into too much.

Songs of  Dhoom and Dhoom 2 playing in the background. Some how the refrence to YRF film that worked for Kala Pathar didn't work for these. Maybe they are too new to deserve a reference.
The Celtic music played in the background at a character's death. Didn't go with the Bambaiya theme of the film.
Among all the festivals shown, I missed the essence of festivities in Mumbai - Ganesh Chaturthi
The 'mard-dard' dialogue - yuck!!
Artificial lighting of the moon and clouds.
Nandu's first training session - extremely predictable.
Replays of scenes and dialogues of some instances in Nandu's mind when he's fighting.
The so-not-subtle metaphor of the cat not drinking milk anymore and the depiction that someone is about to leave Usmaan.
Deepika Padukone's slap! It was a very petty reaction considering the serious situation that she was in.
One of the 'talents' being malakhamb  in the reality show.
Participant's friends just zooming on the stage in a TV reality show.
Nandu's double clap during the dance sequence. One too many times and thus becomes unintentionally funny.

Neil Nitin Mukesh's gray t-shirt with arrows was very nice.
The movie did not comes up with a new concept..All depends upon the acting of the duo..may be it gets success in the box office.hey..promos look good.. the only thing I dislike is the kind of clothes that pinky palkar is wearing is so not mumbai's underbelly. she looks too posh! unless they explain that she is from a middle class nghbd somehow!@tony yeah, it sounds like a standard love story unless they have some major twist up their sleeve@rekha exactly! there's something seriously off with the whole persona. Only hope is somehow when we see it in context it will fit better@lost in cofusion i agree. I'm really curious about the reaction to the film.@Jitaditya apprehensions are not misplaced and they are fed appropriately too...but overall, its a good watch.It could have been way better from the direction and acting point-of-view. The plot is set up aptly. But the entire mid-game is contrived as hell. And the climax follows suit. Neil and Deepika were just not the people for this role. Though Neil tries hard and Deepika doesn't even bother to make a show of doing so.Criminal what they did to a fairly good premise.Change the font styles please - bold and italics, this hurts my eyes.I want to watch this movie, I Love deepika@Rahul @Shilpa oops! my bad. Fixed it. Thanks for pointing it out.Well john got a different role . Only this makes it different.yeah its another good movie i like this as well new thing show up in this songs and actions are aslo good.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.

Parental Guidance:


Violence: Lots of boxing fights with a reasonably gory display of blood. A gun fight and a few slaps too.
Language: Clean albeit the Bambaiyya kind.
Nudity & Sexual content: One liplock. 
Concept: That of guilt and love.
General Look and Feel: It's not overly bright and not dull or boring either. Interspersed at regular intervals with action and songs.
