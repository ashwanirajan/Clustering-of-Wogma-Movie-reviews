Milenge Milenge is more about the times Kareena Kapoor (Priya) and Shahid Kapoor (Amit) don't meet (Jab they don't meet). Unfortunately, the engaging situations are detailed with lame lines and the good performances are packaged in tacky overalls.NOT A REVIEW - Just wondering how this old wine-old bottle affair will fareBack in the days when Shahid Kapoor used to looked like the kid-next-door and not a muscular hunk that drives girls crazy. Back in the days when Kareena Kapoor was size some-positive-integer. Way back in 2004, Milenge Milenge went on floor. 6 years and many, many postponed release dates later, we will see these two on screen on July 9, 2010.I'd have loved to use the adjective "sizzling" for the couple. But, somehow it doesn't seem appropriate now. Maybe because Himesh Reshammiya's music is gawd-awfully dated. Sample 'Tum Chain ho', 
'Kuchh to baaki hai', and 'Milenge milenge'. Also something about the picturisation is off. The music and the visuals don't go together which makes the whole experience very disorienting. Not that there's much to go gaga over in the music itself. The music reviews at Milliblog, IANS, and glamsham also aren't very impressive.Something about destiny playing a role in how a couple meets and parts ways doesn't leave much room for suspense, because they kinda HAVE TO meet again. Not only is there nothing creative about this one line concept, even the names of the lead pair are as commonplace as can be - Priya and Amit. Anyway, the synopsis on the official site goes something like - our lady Priya believes in destiny. She finds love as per directions of destiny foreteller (Kirron Kher). They part, do they meet? Yeah right!Moreover, gone are also the times when the name Kirron Kher meant something you could look forward to. And her as a tarot card reader types brings an image of a completely disposable stereotype.Yep! I sound super-skeptical aboutthis film though the hope is that the Jab We Met couple will be charming together at the very least. But, the key difference is the director. I don't remember the last time I enjoyed something Satish Kaushik directed. Let's hope this is the one!~ ~ ~This article was first published at meetu's Times of India Blog

  A city-bred girl wants to make a successful career out of being a housewife. Her ultimate goal is to mother two kids. Fair enough, that's plausible. The same city breeds this guy who has had an easy life and makes the most out of it by drinking, smoking, and lying. Acceptable. Destiny brings them together. Credible. Answers to how, when, where, are all creative and borderline believable, especially when you accept your fate of having to face cinematic liberty in all its glory. And yet, these parts don't add up to a 'must watch' or even a 'will watch some time.'

When you have destiny as your excuse, nothing really needs to make logical sense, right? Weird, whacky coincidences happen all the time. And despite that, the Milenge Milenge writers have gone to laborious lengths (about 50 minutes) to make a 'chance meeting' happen. That effort we have to acknowledge. But, the trouble is with the unevenness. Amit and Priya get some things so easily and predictably. Some transformations of people around them happen without any effort or reason. But then again, who are we to expect fate to deal an even hand. 
With romantic Hindi films, you can usually tell within the first 15-20 minutes which direction the film is headed and what are the possible climaxes. It's just the 'how you get there' part that makes it interesting. And that is done with a few decent and engaging anecdotes here. But, the other part of the how, the visuals, the feel of the film is like that of a fabric that irritates the skin. Primitive camera work, Hindi soap-opera-type background score, Himesh-Reshammiya-style nasal title score running through the film, inane lyrics, music from the 90s, kitschy dialogues for otherwise interesting situations, other situations which are lame on their own merit, and more such stuff - add up to a "when will this chase to meet be over?" feel. 
And this is extremely sad because Shahid Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor actually do a decent enough job. The playfulness and pain comes through as much as the script allows it to. And you begin rooting for the couple, but Milenge Milenge's script actually doesn't let you get that involved. Especially in the latter half, an arm's length distance is maintained between the audience and the characters. 
Yet, it'd be unfair if I wrote the film off completely. I have a feeling that as superficial as the story is, it connected to me, maybe by just a thread, but it did. And who knows, it might just have worked in the days of (Jab We Met.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Boy meets girl. By coincidence and not. They fall in love. But…do they live together happily ever after?Boy meets girl. By coincidence and not. They fall in love. But…do they live together happily ever after?
Shahid Kapoor's expressions for Satish Shah - over the top, but good acting of having to act.
The 'No Smoking' scene
The Naarad muni story
Having decided to take destiny as a theme, the concept of letting destiny decide (50 Rupee note and book)

The first frame itself - the titles - looks dated.
Ok, who's providing for Priya (Kareena Kapoor)?
I don't if this is good or bad, but because it made me laugh unintentionally, I've put it here. A tarot readers capabilities are limited to when and where she'll meet her man, what he'll be wearing, but not if he's a smoker, teetotaler, etc. 
Even I'd like to have gone to a college that sends students out to Bangkok for youth festivals.
The sudden cut to Amit's (Shahid Kapoor's) friend Ashish in the canteen. 
What is a 24 year old doing in college?!
What kind of hostel in, of all the places, Bangkok have an 8pm curfew?!
The weirdoes in black, with red and yellow scarves, who show up to sing 'ishq ki gali'
Amit lying down on the tracks in the same song.
The suspense built during the life scene. Too melodramatic even for this genre.
The denim shirt and jeans combination that Amit (Shahid Kapoor) wears in one of the scenes looked godawful!
Isnt this the movie that was dabbe mein for saat saal?@Roy yep! that's the one...If we compare "Milenge Milenge" with "I hate love stories" then what do you think,which one is better??@Joydeep again, i don't quite enjoy comparisons, but the two are just about the same level of good vs. bad.@B. H. Harsh I know. The thing is how much weight you give for what's good and what's bad in the film. Just too subjective, movie to  movie, person to person and time to time@lost in confusion haanji, aapka hukum sar aankho par. will do first thing on Monday.@lost in confusion :) here you go... http://wogma.com/movie/red-alert-the-war-within-review/ and thanks for keeping me on my toes!@lost in confusion 'almost as i'd expected' - meaning like what?@lost_in_confusion yeah, that's true of most people who's tastes one keeps track of.

Parental Guidance:


Violence: None
Language: Clean
Nudity & Sexual content: A couple of making out scenes and a scene where balls are used to transform men into women, and the ensuing jokes
Concept: Of life being a lot about destiny and faith
General Look and Feel: Pretty tacky which also means bright and wanna-be peppy
