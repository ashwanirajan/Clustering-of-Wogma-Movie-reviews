Yet another of those insipid, loud, occasionally-crass films that go under the garb of masala entertainment.Ranbir Kapoor in an Action-Romantic-Comedy - hadn't really seen that coming. That too, one that is very *Dabangg-like in its treatment. The trailer proudly introduces the protagonist as - badmaash, awara, robdar, hoshiyar and of course besharam (naughty, tramp, regal, smart/intelligent). And all I could think of while watching it was - letch! The kind that would creep a woman out from the core. It took a while to register that Ranbir Kapoor is playing such a character. A realisation that came with mixed feelings. Maybe, just maybe there is some larger purpose behind this. Or maybe it's just his attempt at playing an action hero. Oh well.It will be a pleasure though to watch Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Singh back together.  Even so, I see myself walking into the theater very apprehensively. The songs aren't too inviting either, despite Ranbir Kapoor's energy and charm. Music Reviews:
glamsham - "4/5" 
koimoi - "2.5/5"  
Milliblog - "that’s two winners for Lalit in an otherwise staid soundtrack!" 
Indian Express - "1.5/5" 
Mumbai Mirror - "Basically, same old, shame old." 
rediff - "3/5"   
    - meeta, a part of the audience
  I guess every star worth his salt should have a typical potboiler to his name - one which makes no sense plot-wise, but insists on claiming that it has one; one which likes to believe that it entertains with toilet and sex humor; one which has a lame song every 15-20 minutes. Besharam is that film for Ranbir Kapoor.The worst bit is that it doesn't do this typical stuff with conviction. Everything from the villain's tyranny to the hero's unabashed personality via the lead lady's pretentiousness seems very well calculated and squeezed in to fit a formula.What's more, this must be first of Ranbir Kapoor's films where you just cannot forget that it is him on screen. It doesn't help that his parents feature in the film as a couple; even though the three of them together Ranbir Kapoor, Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Singh do their best to infuse energy into a spark-less script. It is their comic timing that brings the few laughs that the dialogue allow. That besides, they have pretty much made fools of themselves in a couple of scenes. Pallavi Sharda's presence doesn't bring in any sparkle either. Javed Jaffrey only adds his well-known poor puns. Then again, maybe the blame should be reserved for the writing department. I sat there feeling pretty much insulted that the makers thought this would go down as story/characters/dialogue for us, as an audience. It's not only the predictability of how the different worlds of Mr. Besharam's personality come together or the lack of a peak point. It is as much the feeling that minimum effort was put into thinking about these attributes. Even the action sequences and songs are rather generic.Sure, there is an attempt at being fresh by including bold and crass dialogue. You also have your typical film references strewn across - from Sholay to DDLJ to of course, Dabangg. But, can these lines work when the overall plot is as run-down as it was a couple of decades ago? A soft-cornered Robin Hood-like  hero; a woman who so easily falls for the guy after putting up oh-so-much resistance; a comic relief track. In fact, the mix is worsened by an uninterested villain. Maybe people who can watch Ranbir Kapoor do anything will have a good laugh with him in this one. But, are a star's fans doing justice to his talent by liking films that they wouldn't want the star associated with, in general?

Ranbir Kapoor's Besharam ambition is clear-cut. He wants you to snub all that has defined Bollywood superstardom over two decades now. He is the in-thing, and he wants to underline that fact.

: ‘Besharam’ is thoroughly unamusing!
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Meetu just ignore your inhibitions , Ranbir Kapoor has efficiently made a fan base who are excited about his every new release. He has shown expectional versatility with the choice of film he stars . Having registered a massive hit earlier this year , i am sure Besharam will do see good response from the audience. :)@guddu well, we'll know soon enough, won't we? *fingers crossed*The promo are tantalizing.As Guddu said, Ranbir Kapoor has built a massive and loyal fan base.And the film is a masala film straight out of 1970s - a genre that is back in favor with the masses.  Actually it was never out of favor; only the directors who attempted this genre in 1990s lacked the skills to make successful masala films.All in all my prediction is that this is going to be a box office blockbuster even though contents wise it might be mediocre.@fan Yeah, I have similar thoughts. Let's hope it will be a little above mediocre in terms of content.Saw the trailer yesterday. Perhaps, it would need the the kind of review you gave Grand Masti ( which I thoroughly approved of).@Samir Thank you for your support. But, I guess I have reserve "not reviewed" rating for very few movies, else it'll lose its value. :DSo a movie called BESHARAM with an extremely overrated and mediocre so called "youth icon" whose yet to do a worthwhile film in the last 6 years ends up releasing on Gandhi Jayanti! Need i say more!Ranbir Kapoor's fanbase exists only on paper. Alas,it never reflects at the ticket windows except for the previous occasion where dear young Deepika saved a disastrous script and an equally disastrous title. This so called "youth icon" is a media created farce. The only folk who look up to him as an icon are teenage noobs straight out of high school who dunno what to do with their lives and consider juvenile nonsense like Wake Up Sid as a reflection of India's youth (far from reality that is).Oops,did i offend some folk out here who form part of the few handful of Ranbir fans across India (the author included :P)"Maybe people who can watch Ranbir Kapoor do anything will have a good laugh with him in this one."~Such people do not exist and neither does pretty boy Ranbir deserve this level of stardom exclusively reserved for the 3 Khan's and Hrithik to some extent!@Anuj I don't know what to say to you, except :)Besharam is d kind of movie which gives u schziophernia and miagrain. I walked out of the hall after interval without torturing myself further, not only my expectations were havoced , i had one of d most terrible expreince due to its insane screenplay nd plot.   Randbir Kapoor was simply unbearable, his parents were atleast watchable. Abhinav Kashyap thought may be he can pull another hit by repeating the dabang formula but he forgot Randbir is no Salman who can uplift such gigantic level of trash.@Guddu sympathies. :)Oooo too many below average to average reviews on wogma and outside wogma.Given the superstitious nature of bollywood in future they would be scared to make a film called beshara as twice now a besharam starring superstar has flopped - first in 1978 at the peak of Amitabh's career and now when RK was peaking.@Fan Thank goodness for some mercies? :D I haven't seen the '78 one though.A silent reader of your blog missing the notepad section since last few weeks. Please take out your notepad from your closet :)Amitabh's Besharam was an Average affair and not a Flop. Such was the enigma of the man that even Average fares like Shaan,Satte Pe Satta,Kaala Patthar,Besharam etc were considered Flops only 'coz of the massive expectation that came with every Amitabh film (80% of his 40 odd films between 1973 and 1985 were certified Hits).Contrasting that to media made so called superstar Ranbir,such is the manipulation and cheating of out media and the critics that his genuinely AVERAGE fares like Bachna Ae Haseeno,Rockstar & Wake Up Sid have been perceived as Hits by manipulating media and pseudo intellectual urban idiots who dunno a thing about how box office operates and what true "popularity" and "superstardom" means! P.S.: Not to mention the kiddos and pretty boys and girls who consider garbage bin trash like Rockstar/Bachna... and juvenile rubbish like Wake Up Sid & YJHD as "cults" (of course without knowing the definition and the true meaning of a cult,all thanks to the media).@Soham *sigh* I know, I should get that back, no? Will do, from next time. Till then, thank you for reading and bringing me back in line ;)@Anuj continued... :)@Meeta : How would u describe the popularity of an actor whose yet to give the bigest hit of the year in his 7 years of "superstardom" and has featured among the top 3 actors of the year (based on box office and audience response,not on the manipulative awards) only once (that too in a multistarrer)? :PBy the way,here are the other reviews of yet another lousy,unbearably bad and absolutely pointless RK film. Read and judge for yourself.I guess someone forgot to "gift" the media this time around :Phttp://bollyindiaboxoffice.blogspot.in/2013/10/besharam-reviews.html@Meetu: 1978 Besharam was a mediocre affair compared to other Amitabh's films.  Talking for myself who was a blind fan of Big B in that period found Besharam quite lacklustre.  One has to keep in mind though what Anuj said i.e. expectations from a Big B film in 1978 were humangous.  Also; Big B had a major competitor in himself.  For instance his besharam was released in peak summer school holidays period where for 4 consecutive Friday we had big B films viz. Kasme Vaade, Besharam, Don and Trishul.  So you can imagine the period :-)The only actor who supersedes Amitabh Bachchan in terms of popularity is probably Dilip Kumar. And the point to be noted is that whatsoever the self proclaimed cinematic intellects and critics have to say,Salman Khan is the most poplar Bollywood actor in the domestic market in the last 20 years! If doing "nonsense masala films" can get you the kind of popularity and fan following Salman enjoys,i'm sure these proponents of "good and intellectual cinema" would give 2 hoots about script and content. But then again,he is The Salman Khan,nobody competes with him. Sorry critics,but i'm sure Mental is gonna make you chaps go Mental indeed & leave you with egg on your faces :P@fan:You forgot the fact that Muqaddar Ka Sikandar too released in 1978,AB's biggest hit after Sholay and second biggest blockbuster of the decade of the 70's!In all, Besharam fails to achieve the intended humour and is so lacking in interest as to cause mental weariness. Stay away, it’s difficult to sit through!Ranbeer Looks awesome in this film.Movie is good.I like "Dil Kaa Jo Haal Hai" songs.After a long time Abhijeet sung a very good songs.best of luck Besharam.@Anuj See, I think Ranbir Kapoor is a brilliant actor, then his commercial success doesn't matter to me. Our difference of opinion on these two basic points is well-established. :DAnd why this comparison with Amitabh Bachchan!? Why compare at all, with anyone. I can be a fan of Amitabh Bachchan and like Ranbir Kapoor, enough room for all those who I like. :PCommercial success of an actor is testimony to what proportion of the audience thinks of that particular actor as good/awesome/brilliant. And going by Ranbir's success ratio,its evident that a greater proportion of people consider Sunny Deol and Jackie Shroff to be better actors than Ranbir :P  You're in an elite club indeed,that of maybe a few thousands who considers this dumbed down version of Raj Kapoor as "brilliant" :DA silent reader of your blog missing the notepad section since last few weeks.
