Sarcastic spewing on the state of the nation, comic timing and peppy item numbers by the reigning "stars" provide a few select moments of entertainment. Other than that, vanilla slapstick is what it is.NOT A REVIEW - just my take on pre-release takes of others...The four characters of Krazzy 4 are described as "Crazy for anger", "Crazy for cleanliness", "Crazy for freedom" and at this point they lost interest in looking for things that a person could be crazy "for", so they came up with the brilliant..."Simply crazy". Now before I am labeled as "Crazy for English" or much worse "Crazy for Sanity in Indian cinema", let's move on to what other people think.Speaking of crazy people becoming a source of entertainment to the non-crazy population, A mother in India is offended by the trivialized portrayal of a cruel and devastating illness. In her blog, she talks about her experiences and challenges in getting help for her daughter who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia.Sensitivity has never been our strong point, especially in the slapstick genre. Whether it be mental illnesses or using homosexuality as a subject of rude and crude humor. Being closely associated with 2-3 people suffering from schizophrenia, I completely empathize with "A mother in India". These people are already heavily marginalized and are extremely low on confidence, do they really need us to laugh at them?So, let's see what the Bollywood Czar has to say about his latest production.Ahem...Ahem...ahem...And finally...I promise to reserve judgement till after I have seen the movie. Maybe we will be pleasantly surprised and we will be laughing with the Krazzy 4 and not at them.

Twitter reviews for this movie are not available.No readers have rated this movie yet.This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.It's Krazzy-4's day out from the mental asylum they are being treated at. They find out that it's a mad mad world out there. 
Guys, 10 minutes into the movie, I gave up on taking notes on this one. When a movie starts with naming mental diseases that were supposed to make people laugh, what more can you say?It's Krazzy-4's day out from the mental asylum they are being treated at. They find out that it's a mad mad world out there. Guys, 10 minutes into the movie, I gave up on taking notes on this one. When a movie starts with naming mental diseases that were supposed to make people laugh, what more can you say?The film is about four mentally unstable people who escape from the mental hospital in order to explore the world. I hope that it’ll take a good position in bollywood box-officeHey..u got Bollywood Czar quote wrong. Allow me to put the correct quote for ur reference.. "The idea of the story came to me almost 8 to 10 years ago…after observing the movie The Dream Team. Jaideep Sen was sitting close to me at time. This happened  whilst making Koi…mil gaya and Krrish, I wanted to give him a break as an independent director and decided that he had the right sensibility  to copy a movie and would not go over the top telling people that it's a ripped off movie. Hence he's directing Krazzy 4… and finally"In keeping with the Filmkraft ethos, Krazzy 4, too is not your usual run-of-the-mill film. In fact it's much much worse than that"Hope this clears up the matters :):D Have you seen the movie already, Sudhir?http://vibhash.blogspot.com/2008/04/krazy-4.htmlCopyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
