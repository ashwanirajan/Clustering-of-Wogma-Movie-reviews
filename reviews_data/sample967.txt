wogma rating: Watch when on TV/online (?) - Salman Khan Fans - go for it!
    
  I don't know about bravery and courage, but I recognize the attempt in making an epic entertainer and I see partial success. Unfortunately, only partial. And yet, Salmaniacs can rejoice!Ancestral feud. Mutual hatred. Boy meets girl. And if that ain't enough, you have rom-com, song-dance sequences and comic relief. Those, as we all know, are the ingredients of the masala cocktail. They seem to be in almost the right proportion too. How much each element is allowed to marinate is where things go wrong. So, while it’s a go right ahead for "Salmaniacs", for others it's not a complete loss either.

That could be because some masalaparameters are kept void, like a love triangle, a spy in the tribe, etc. But, if we really wanted to get into what could have been, there is a lot more that could've been straightened out for it to make a better mark with the audiences. For example, the comic element in the romantic thread distracted from the story big time. The sincerity of the lovers didn't reach us mainly due to the laughs the makers seek to generate. 
Then, there's the almost 3-hour length and the pace at which every elements of the story unfolds. While the introduction to various Rajahs and Sardars and their black, white and guess what…some gray characters takes up the first half, it isn't boring. For one the way the camera moves, pans and zooms, make you marvel at the terrain. Then the songs, especially Taali, is composed, sung, picturized (in a smallish tribal den), and choreographed to draw and keep your attention. At this point you are wondering about the story that is still waiting to be told and you see potential too. 
Welcome the second half. While the good things of the first half are nowhere to be seen, the plot leads you to some extremely involving conflicts and dilemmas. The politics between the British, the Rajputs and the commoners is intriguing. So, you don't really miss the enjoyable music, because there's something that keeps you hooked. Unfortunately, the pace at which it needs to be told now (in the hour that's left) is a challenge. And everything has to be resolved in a hurry, leaving way too many important questions unanswered. And it ends in the most disappointing fashion ever! 
At the end, it is like almost every Salman-starrer. More about him, the actor, than about his character. He plays the cool-dude only wearing Pindhari outfits (I've serious doubts any of the costumes were researched or authentic). His dad played by Mithun does his bit of being happy, full of valor and emotional in turns. The beautiful-but-plaster-of-Paris look of debutant Zarine Khan is interesting only because of the meat her character could potentially hold. Yes, a woman in an epic drama actually had a valuable role, but in the end it all collapses into the humdrum. How I wish, her actions were explained a little better and she was shown to have a brain of her own. Her dilemma between love and duty was worthy of some more detail. 
Because my time in the theater was spent smiling and waiting for interesting things to happen, it kept me interested. But once out, when I think about each element in the story that caught my fancy, I realized it wasn't developed further. They didn't take it to a conclusion, logical or otherwise. I'd still not trash it; it's a fair attempt to entertain, and manages to do that intermittently.

        ...The performances are good enough, Mithunda (aaayyyeee!) is great as Dadda, brother Sohail is doing his bit of monkeying around as the younger bro, even the new girl Zarine Khan has her moments of looking pretty...

        ...The movie vainly tries to rebuild the old world charm with numerous scenes of jousting, Gladiator style hand-to-hand combat and a ‘swayamwar’....

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Warning: this section has some details that could distort your experience while watching the movie. I strongly recommend reading this only after you have seen the movie or if you have decided not to see it.The Pindharis (a tribe in the interiors of Rajputana), during the British Raj, are betrayed by the Prince of Madhavgadh (Jackie Shroff). The former vow to avenge the deaths of their brethren and one of the lead Pindharis (Mithun Chakroborty) train their young to fight the Rajas and the British.

The cinematography in the first war sequence.
A full house of 600 cheering the newborn baby they know is going to grow up to be Salman Khan.
A possible tribute to the train sequence in Sholay, the train sequence here was well shot too, only it needed to be a little longer for a better impact.
some of the action scenes seem so effortless. Example: the scene where Sohail Khan hangs from Salman's leg during the taali song 
The first shot of London. Gray, bleak marking industrial revolution as opposed to the rugged deserts of Rajputana.

Ok, if Mithun was the young war in 1862 and present day is in 1920, Mithun is close to 75 assuming that he was 17 in the first war sequence which is a stretch in itself. So agile at 75. Which also means by the end of the film he is close to 100, that is also assuming a lot! Does not add-up!!
Over-glamorizing the lead character. It’s a pain to watch hero entering or making grand moves in slo-mo.
Was such open display of affection between a husband and wife acceptable in those times?
The animal sacrifice scene was completely out of place. Almost as if they wanted to keep the animal rights wing happy.
The entire India vs. England dialogue - again pretentious and a crowd-pleaser put in for the sake of having one in.
Whatever happened to Veer-Punya learning about how the Brit brain works?!
The Bollywoody dances displayed in 1920s in England.
"University college of England!!" what kind of a name is that for a college!?
The entire college environment being one huge dance party.
Salman Khan from the interiors of India knows how to play the piano?!
Salman's flairing nostrils when his character is supposed to be angry
Why doesn't Yashodhara's aide give Yahodhara's letter to her father?
some of the scenes between Salman and Mithun are particularly loud.
The Rajput boy uses Urdu words randomly in songs and dialogue. 

Why is everyone in the hostel wearing a white pyjama-kurta? These are people from different countries!
Make-up of people who have just been killed or have killed someone - too symmetrical and unreal
By far the worst film of the year. It stank. Salman's acting is anyways pathetic and the script is so bad, that i don't knw why he wasted so many years writing this bull crap.Wow.. what a comprehensive review! First time here, got to know you through indiblogger. Nice review. Thanks for the detailed review :)wow...thats an awesome review... so elaborate and every minute detail covered..not a salman fan.. but loved the songs so mite jus watch the movie ;)@Kabir ouch...that must hurt...@Mohan, @megz thank you!@Anoop and @Rahul - No, people. There were some bits that I liked and I gotta say it if I liked it. You haven't a clue how difficult it is for me to admit that I partially enjoyed a Salman filmWhat we see behind the veil are always lessons of Dharma, the way things are, which in recent times have been exposed by the upheaval in global economies.kauf ed hardyed hardyCopyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
