wogma rating: Add to 'must watch' list (?)
You'll watch a great film unfold that is engaging despite being slow and violent. Yet, it is quite literally incomplete. Powerful performances and rustic visuals and sounds make the film worth a watch just by themselves. If there's one name I'd like to blindly follow and watch every film that he had anything to do with, it would have to be Anurag Kashyap's. Even beyond Amitabh Bachchan. There, I said it. Which makes me really nervous too. I want to love the film; I want everyone to love the film; well, I want everyone to excitedly wait for the film - which is why I have to watch myself closely for biases when reviewing it. Anyway, enough about my emotions, let's get to the film. There's dark humor, there's gory violence, there's supposedly material worth over 5 hours of run-time. Even if it's not all at one go, and the two parts are split two weeks apart, it is a huge risk. Should we admire this as confidence or get cynical about over-confidence? Should we snub at it as arrogance or for once admire the guts behind the arrogance?In many ways, it looks like it will be our heartland's own Godfather. You can see the ganglord's (Manoj Bajpai) character growth even in the trailers. You can tell the characters relish humiliating each other. Doing it in two parts with story spread over a few decades is likely to re-register the age old conclusion that gangster films try to make - war is futile, revenge is futile. Here's hoping Gangs of Wasseypur will do it with a captivating narrative and detailed characters.Just in case, any of us had any doubt about Anurag Kashyap's love for taking risk, just listen to the soundtrack once. While I'm not a huge fan of innuendo, 'hunter' tune has really gotten to me. And this risk paid off because the madness has become really popular. My personal favorite for being completely mental is 'tain tain to to.' The entire team has lost it by having too much fun. Full stop.So, as I leave you with the music reviews, I cross my fingers that Gangs of Wasseypur is not one of those movies where the director whose films you really look forward to ends up disappointing you. fingers crossed with a loud heartbeat that's only speeding up.Music Reviews:
Milliblog - "Gangs of Wasseypur is one of the most original and imaginative soundtracks in recent times!"
Music Aloud - "8.5/10"
dunkdaft - "Such a fantstatic soundtrack that is part innovative part funny and overall awesome!"
Bollyspice - "We went with 4.5 but to be honest I am seriously leaning toward our highest ever rating of 5/5!"
Bollywood Hungama - "2/5"
Happy Sing - "In fact the album tells me that music not always needs to be ‘composed’, you can ‘discover’ music and then produce it. Of course, that too needs a genius, but that would be a genius that would continuously learn, and it seems Sneha Khanwalkar is one such genius. More power to her."

  'Whacky' - every frame of Gangs of Wasseypur reeks of it. Imagine that in film set in the interiors of Jharkhand. The language, the characters, the dynamics of their relationship with each other, the songs that play in the background all add to the rugged, earthy feeling of the film. An experience very few directors in India can provide. Yet, it is not self-sufficient. As a story the experience is incomplete because we know we have watched only half a film. There's more to come and what we saw so far is not a film that stands alone. Much like its characters, Wasseypur has been pushed from here to there at hands of destiny and the world has been very matter-of-factly about it. In typical documentary tone you are told how Wasseypur has moved from Bengal to Bihar to now Jharkhand over 40-odd years. It is almost ironical when the voice behind that tone, Piyush Mishra is consoling a woman whose husband has cheated on her comment on her destiny. Many a time it does come across as a docu-drama that Anurag Kashyap wants to use to document the messed up system that most of India lived in since independence. Gangs of Wasseypur is a story Wasseypur's story, where Wasseypur itself represents the many small towns in this country that suffer at the hands of politicians and goons. You can't even call it the underworld because the perpetrators are so blatant about the fear they want to induce with their power.  At the same time, humor is infused and character of the film is built with time references to various films along the way. Almost as a pointer to the Bollywood-centric theme that part II is promised to have. While Gangs of Wasseypur touts itself as a revenge saga, you will realize it is a lot more. An anti-hero as a protagonist who finds it difficult to go without sexual release. He almost always comes across as the underdog because of the situations that he gets himself into and often he looks like he is making a fool of himself. Yet he is tender at heart for the people he really cares about. The dry humor used only adds to that judgement. You can't but wonder how his experiences as a son might have changed the equation with his sons. Strong women who aren't lead ladies by Hindi film standards - they are proud of how brutally the men of their lives use power against the entire world (except for them), a staunch friend, a few double crossers, sons who find it difficult to get out of their dad's shadow even though they hate him, all don’t let Gangs of Wasseypur remain a standard revenge saga.Yes, it is violent. Yes, it does try to make the same ol' point that revenge films have always tried - that it is futile because too many people on all sides die too gory a death. But Gangs of Wasseypur goes beyond that, it has characters who represent dissent - to them truce is not an option, never. Very few 'gang war' films allow room to those people who were bruised so bad that they cannot forgive. Also you see that exiting the trade is not an option. Even if a goon wants to mend his ways, if he is high profile enough, whatever business he gets into will invite unhealthy attention from rivals. To single out any one or two actors as being good at their job might imply that the others weren't as good and that woul be plain wrong. And what about the other stars of the film - the outstanding music, the way each film uses natural sources of light and keeps artificial ones at minimum, the fairly simple but amazingly perfect composition of frames, the three or four times slow-motion is used, especially in the last scene, the background score that becomes outright crazy given the context it is used in. No review would be complete without mentioning these heroes.Gangs of Wasseypur may demand patience from some of the viewers, but I enjoyed the pace and the time it took to settle down. It's like reading beautiful prose, whether or not you like what is written, you admire the way it is written. More often than not, you find yourself wondering if this is India's very own Godfather. Yet, it doesn't take away from the nagging incomplete feeling. Though what it also means is you are asking for the more you have been promised with utmost eagerness. Ps. What is it about use of abusive language in films that makes young adult males giggle like teenage girls?

An epic with some of the best music in recent times..
Hats off to Manoj, Anurag and cast of Gow.

AditiKhairnar:
          The music is lecheroulsy attractive!The cinematography impeccable!Casting could not have been better!Script is flawless!Hail Anurag!#GOW
        
Slowbum:
          Anurag Kashyap's vision of an Indian 'Godfather'? Visceral in spurts, rambling in others. Reserving my judgment till concluding part #GOW
        
ryecatching:
          "..Wasseypur" Is Not "Shanghai". Period. - I rated Gangs of Wasseypur ★★★☆☆. http://gomiso.com/r/ZeUz

WhorribleWriter:
          Gangs of Wasseypur is so predictable you can easily imagine what is coming to you. A lot of characters hastily mixed in a hot potpourri.
        
taruche:
          Saw/suffered a "movie"called Gangs of Wasseypur. Why did they make it? Shldv taken @madversity 's suggestion abt Vicky Donor seriously.
        
SurajitDasgupta:
          #GOW Expletives do not a film make. There is more to Bihar/Jharkhand than gaand, laand, aand, madar/beti-chod and bhonsdi ke.
        
snehachauhan12:
          #GOW post interval was a drag.
        
sir_s_r:
          A movie can't be good just because of foul language, cuss words and a learing character.. Disappointing GOW :-(
        
SagarMundhra:
          Just like Gangs Of Wasseypur RT @ChalHuttt Judge me if u like but I think Starbucks coffee is highly overrated.
        
phoenix2701:
          Tip:  do not watch 2nd half of 'gangs of wasseypur'...
        
KamathGurudutt:
          http://goo.gl/0myql A brilliant review of a dumb film Gangs of Wasseypur by @SudhishKamath in The Hindu. Mostly agree with him.
        
gnuger:
          Gangs of Wasseypur was a disappointment, ok the portrayal of hooliganism was good but again far too less than reality

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.@Sunny yep! that dark humor, it does draw your attention!On an unrelated note, Bollywood Hungama should get a new music reviewer.@Rahul ha ha ha ha!Glad to see the movie work out great!Meetu i have to laud your observation . "Women are proud of how brutaly the man of their lives use power against other except for them" . I believe this is the reality of all mafia lord wives around d world , no wonder it was detected by a woman ( you ) . I think u really sensed the movie's environment aptly. :DNicely written! While I am almost certain about movie's great show in the global arena, I too am skeptical about movie's show at the Box office. Also, I recently wrote a review of Gangs of Wasseypur for my movie blog that can be read at:http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/2012/06/gangs-of-wasseypur-2012-part-i-of.html@Amol possible, very possible that I miss out on the context being a woman. More often than not though, I can't help but feel that the laughter, LOLs, giggles, snickers are all out of seeing someone do/say the forbidden. You are right, it doesn't amuse me because to me they are just words, like any other words, and I guess it's my loss that I don't see the joke. What I have a problem with though is the constant loudness of laughter because of which you miss out on dialogue that follows. Oh well, I take it as a part of the atmosphere the film has created. @Harsh I thought the abusive language was used very, very matter-of-factly which was why it worked so well. I think the audience creating a joke out of it, made it look juvenile - which it certainly wasn't.@Amol @Harsh @Jitesh Obviously, I don't think people should stop laughing when they feel like it. I just wonder what it about profanity that makes them behave so immaturely - laugh out so loud, retort to the profanity, etc.@Abhinav ouch! @raaj you write about story and screenplay for what was shown. It was intentionally broken into two parts, so there had to be some logic behind it. I commented on what I saw thus far.Sorry, that was a mistake. Thanks for pointing it out, Sunil! Fixed.Good movie I liked it...http://www.lenstrade.comAn over-rated film, despite wanna be good performances, i wold score it 2.3/5   If viwers can criticise masla, why cant viewers criticise non-masala.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
