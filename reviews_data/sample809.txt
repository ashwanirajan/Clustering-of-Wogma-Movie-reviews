It is one adorable road trip! Another awesome performance by Vinay Pathak & a good one by Lara Dutta too! If only there was some control on the urge to do something dramatically drastic in the second half.  If you have even simply commuted to work using public transport, you know about that pesky co-traveller. You don't even need a trip longer than just-a-commute to know about that one. And imagine you are anal retentive, almost obsessive compulsive and that intrusive co-traveller is also unhygienic and loud. And now imagine this is you, but you are the third traveller watching one annoy the other. Damn funny, right? And why not? When you aren't the one suffering. And that’s exactly what happens in Challo Dilli. Unfortunately, it goes overboard with the situations in the second half.

You will have a smile pasted for every bit of the first half of the film. And then you see the writer's desperation to make the story a little more than just a regular road trip. You see them suddenly take a plunge into crime & politics. Maybe this is their attempt at picking the pace a bit post-interval, but it didn't work for me.
Maybe because I had settled into the lazy, pleasant stroll that the film had set-up. The shift in the quantity and quality of events thereafter came as a jolt. The subtle hints on the Mumbai vs. Delhi attitude, the city vs. small-town mentality, the upper middle class vs. lower middle-class divide transform into on-the-face comments about the society we live in and socio-politics take over.
But with Vinay Pathak and his all-so refreshing performance, everything looks tolerable. That Lara Dutta wasn't acting as if she had no brains was an added bonus. They had some very nice witty, everyday language going on too. 
The well-executed camera work and the engaging background music made the experience even better. Usually, when these departments draw attention, it gets registered in my head negatively. But here they add a lot to the two hours spent on the film. 
Go along, be the third person watching all the fun on this funny, quirky journey, even if it’s a DVD watch.

effayeffay:
          Watched "Chalo Dilli"... Good fun! Vinay Pathak is brilliantly obnoxious.
        
CyberBlabber:
          again: "Chalo Dilli" awesome. great performances. very apt depiction of the varied human nature in the multi-cultural landscape of India.
        
cotuc:
          Vinay Pathak rocks. Liked @DuttaLara too in Challo Dilli. Good movie. Paysa wasoool.

chaudhary_kapil:
          Chalo Dilli: Inspired from Due Date....funny and watchable....Vinay Pathak as usual awsome...lara was good but Yana was awsome..
        
atulsingh001:
          Watched "Chalo Dilli" a good entertaining movie. may be inspired by "Due Date" including lots of hindi filmy tadka. #fb
        
ashithakur:
          Dekh li ji #Chalo Dilli :) nai dekhta na, to "Badi baat ho jaati". Must see movie hai. Sirf Hasna (cont) http://www.twitlonger.com/show/abd4hp

ashish_pathak80:

anshulnitk06:
          chalo dilli ...gud movie for those who are not critic...
        
Anirudh_Shukla:
          Shor in the city and Chalo Dilli are cool movies to see...
Haunted is not at all watchable....
        
akinak87:
          Saw 'Chalo Dilli' yesterday. The 'Bheegi Basanti' production house makes you wonder for a bit, but a fab movie nonetheless!
        
adityakapoor:
          Chalo dilli - hilarious, vinay pathak gets my salute.
        
16geetika:
          Chalo Dilli....a cute, entertaining movie. And Vinay Pathak is such a fine actor!
        
shailip:
          Chalo Dilli was a pretty ok movie. Vinay Pathak is awesome.
        
rijujacobs:
          Chalo dilli... a feel good movie..vinay does what he is best at....lara...u've got a rich husband...be jus a producer...overall...time pass
        
namansaraiya:
          Just saw Chalo Dilli. Vinay Pathak, you beauty. Jab We Met re-incarnate. Needs stronger/shorter script. Over-all, decent. 3/5. #LateReview
        
md610:
          Chalo Dilli is a watchable movie.
        
Lath_rit:
          Saw chalo dilli can't understand why everybody is so mad about it. Its good but something just gets bored and slagging at the end.
        
Kruspace:
          Vinay Pathak made the otherwise weak Chalo Dilli worth a watch...the start 2 d picturesque road ride was promising but cld not hold ground
        
journopriyankka:
          Chalo Dilli was ok-toke........
        
hemrajsingh:
          Saw 'Chalo Dilli'. A good one-time watch. Don't expect a great deal. Reminds of 'Due Date' though. :)
        
Forever_Tarun:
          chalo dilli, one time watch hai ji. Kaun si badi baat ho gayi, no need to make it emotional in the end. Lara is good http://m.tweete.net/longtweet/lduzuih

Divyavaani:
          So chalo dilli is just kaam chalaoo..
        
biswamitra123:
          Chalo Dilli-a good muvi to watch..irritates u to the core and u r left wid no options other than to laugh..
        
arjun_mehra:
          Chalo Dilli- Lara Dutta's voice shouldn't have been dubbed. 
Vinay Pathak is a gem n the only above avg thing in the movie.
        
araushan:
          CHALO DILLI could have been little better....
        
_Manashwi:
          Weekend viewing: #Fast5 (whatever happened to 'fast' cars?); Chalo #Dilli (despite its moments felt like d 2hr flick went on for 2hrs45min)
        
suyognabar:
          Chalo Dilli not as gud as its hype... I guess @pathakvinay  das vidaniya & straight were much better.....
        
shakwrites:
          'Chalo Dilli' was like trying to take a decent short story and stretching it into a 400 page novel. Highly counter productive. #review
        
RootKanal:
          saw chalo dilli. vinay pathak is a saving grace. and so is akshay kumar for a change :S
        
pathiknagda:
          Chalo dili lasted 05 mins it sucks big time vinay pathak goes on n on and lara dutta tries to make faces thats it movie over
        
motihariwala:
          Walked out of Chalo Dilli. Really bad. I mean it. Real real bad.
        
khullarkapil:
          Chalo dili boring movie
        
GunjanArora25:
          Chalo Dilli is a stale dish with ingredients of boring jokes, predictable scenes and unending crap!
