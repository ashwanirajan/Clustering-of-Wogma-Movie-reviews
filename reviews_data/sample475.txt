Nautanki Saala! Makes you want to believe that lovely performances by two lead characters, witty dialogue and a philosophical concept delivered with humor would be enough to make a film rise above the ordinary. Unfortunately it is matched by plastic/caricaturish performances by the rest of the cast, some slapsticky humor and a run down south towards a typical climax. Ayushman Khurana's Vicky Donor and Rohan Sippy's Bluffmaster make you look forward to Nautanki Saala which brings them together. The trailer only adds on to that curiosity. Unfortunately though, you are reminded of Rohan Sippy's Dum Maaro Dum and you have to hold your excitement. In a way, that works out fine for Nautanki Saala because it keeps expectations under control. The trailer doesn't give much away beyond the fact that Ayushman Khurana plays a theater director/actor and there is some form of a love triangle in the making. All of it has a quirky edge which only builds curiosity. The songs too seem to be liked my almost all reviewers. A small budget film, which looks like it is going to be a different experience from the norm. Even if it isn't a good film, I might just enjoy the slight element of uniqueness it promises. Music Reviews:
Apun Ka Choice - "3/5"
Bollyspice - "4.5/5"
dunkdaft - "Many cooks has served a great broath together. "
Milliblog - "Nautanki Saala is a solid and fully loaded soundtrack, in variety and imagination!"
Music Aloud - "8/10"

  Ram vs. Raavan is a simple enough good vs. evil fight. Unless the struggle is between the Ram and Raavan in you. Nautanki Saala has this very intriguing conflict set at its heart - the one within. Remarkably enough, it also manages, to a great extent, to keep things light with quippy dialogue. Unfortunately though, it slacks off more often than not, the story loses its way and that kind of intrigue exists only in one of the characters. The plot starts out with a man of today called Ram (Ayushman Khurana), who is too good to be true, saving a stranger's life. Interestingly enough he plays Raavan in a stage show that he directs too. The quirky treatment to an outlandish start gives the film a dream-like ambiance. But it is pretty amazing how the atmosphere created doesn't let the implausibility of it all bother you. However, that lasts only for the first hour or so.The turn of events in the second half take Nautanki Saala into the regular girl-boy zone. Except for glimpses of the protagonist's struggle with himself, the situations become pretty ordinary. Not to mention, other than Ram and Mandar (Kunal Roy Kapoor), the other characters are lame from the outset. Especially the women. While Chitra (Gaelyn Mendonca) is refreshingly understanding her maturity isn't consistent. The other lady, Nandini (Pooja Salvi) is dumb and dumber both. That more than one man would fall in love with her, is extremely unconvincing. Also, neither Chitra nor Pooja are helped by the performances. Both Gaelyn and Pooja are plastic dolls given trendy styles to wear. The men however, do a magnificent job of keeping you engaged with their performances. Kunal Roy Kapoor's Mandar is eternally depressed and yet, quirkily funny evoking the side in you that enjoys dark humor. A few characters break into a regional language which seems both unnatural as a part of the film and is superficially delivered by the actors. Ayushman Khurana wins you over once again with a charming performance. He plays both Ram and the part of him trying to keep his internal Raavan at bay, with equal conviction. All this while making it look natural and effortless. Expect to be blown over by the way he kisses his girl - one of the most natural, comfortable and convincing on-screen kisses I have seen in Hindi cinema. It's pretty much these two and the witty dialogue that keeps you going for the 2+ hours of the film. It slows down considerably, picking pace very unevenly, and once in a longish while. The quirks are enjoyable, but there is enough slapstick humor, in the form of sexual and toilet humor and the usual slapping around and falling people, attempting to make you laugh. The ambiance created by the colors, lighting and music too is very slick and helps to keep the dragging parts alive.Yet, with the given premise, it's sad that the narrative didn't take itself beyond the obvious Ramayan references. The hat tip towards how each one of us wears a mask and churns out a life full of drama for ourselves is subtle and enjoyable. But, that it all boils down to a very ordinary romance takes all that away from Nautanki Saala!

          Nautanki Saala -- subtle & suave in bursts.. lost & long in bursts too.. overall average fluff.. good time-pass but little more. 3★

dg2weet:
          Nautanki saala - even though movie is okay but due to the background score being Zero even the funny scenes looks dull and movie slow.

          Nautanki Saala not a very good movie,  but still enjoyed it.  Intelligent pun and superb acting.

          Nautanki Saala is quite boring but I enjoyed it.

          Yes, Nautanki Saala is goofy and amusing but it would be a much more endearing film without the annoying female characters..

          Nautanki saala. Script is quite like chashme badoor. I would prefer CB. NS is kinda copy of CB. Ayushman not equal to 3 of CB.

          Nautanki Saala - a pathetic film! Weak script, forced act by lead cast. Rohan Sippy, please hire a talented writer next time. @Anushka_Arora

          Nautanki sala is such a  disappointment. Aayushman n kunal completely wasted thanks to the weak script. Funny in parts but that's just it!

          If anyone creates too much drama in your life, just make them sit through Nautanki Saala. Gross irritating and psychotic. Headache begins.

          . @Nautanki_Saala has some genuinely funny moments but overall doesn't add up to a fully satisfying film. Meanders in the 2nd half..

          Nautanki Saala has its moments but fails in delivering good performances by its lead actors. My rating: 2/5 stars. #disappointing

          "Nautanki Sala" was a terrible waste of 130 minutes. #CustomaryLateMovieReview

FarazSalat:
          #Nautanki #Saala will entertain you in parts. It's stretched to elastic limit only to break and fall flat. It's a champagne with no fizz.

booksroundup:
          After being totally disappointed by Nautanki Saala, time to watch Terrence Mallick's new film. That would be a great way to end the night

BBC3rdEye:
          Nautanki Sala is technically and artfully well done good acting but so moronic, are we inane and just dumber by the day?
        
AwakeOnRequest:
          It's been ages since i left a movie hall in shock coz of how bad the movie was. PLS AVOID Nautanki Saala. YUCK.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Ram (Ayushman Khurana) saves a stranger, Mandar (Kunal Roy Kapoor) who is trying to commit suicide. A dilemma arises when he tries to patch things up between Mandar and the woman he is in love with, Nandini (Pooja Salvi)Ram (Ayushman Khurana) saves a stranger, Mandar (Kunal Roy Kapoor) who is trying to commit suicide.

The titles. Sets the mood for a quirky ride. 
The nod to Puneri Paatya
The hospital receptionist, though it was a tad overdone when repeated the third time. 

Mandar's use of Marathi.
Mandar's aaji (grandmother) has had a cataract operation and claims to not be able to see, whereas when she takes her black glasses off, only one of her eyes is operated on, the other is just fine!
What was aaji's 'dhol' about?
The morphine sequence.
Lolly's caricaturish character, again overdone.
The 'kutta' (dog) scene at the flower shop which involved Lolly. 

The continuity jerk when Ram and Mandar parked on a highway and suddenly they meet with an accident  on a city road. 
Inspired by: Après VousThis movie a great relief to me in the genre of comedy....coz i was frustated after watching chasme badoor and himmatwala....ayushman was awsome....with a perfect comic timing....great work....Meetu there was a long tedious smooch scene i ever saw in the recent times , did u found it gratuitous ?Superb movie, great timepassAyushman and Kunal are fabolousI agree on the minus points too bt i found the marathi goodThe smooch scene was long but superbSongs are superb tooI liked the use of So Gaya Yeh Jahaan it was refreshing@Anup Yeah in comparison, this is a gem! :D@guddu I didn't find it gratuitous at all. I thought it was natural and very well done. @Silvano Yep! And good to see you back!The characters were good in the movie.. Good time pass and not boring at all.. Over all reviews it is a must watch movie for those people who want to have fun...Yay! The notepad is back!!! :P@Harsh :D Just for readers like you! :DYa I know :P :) Btw, I just came back after watching 'Commando' and logged in to check your review, only to see you haven't reviewed it!P.S. - One of the better-made commercial movies of the recent times, I must say..I love Ayushman because he is just like or any of my friends - and without any prejudice I can he was superb. I had some serious doubts about Kumal's acting but let me add here that he was awesome and I hate to say that he was probably better than AK.Good time pass movie !@Harsh oh is it? there weren't appropriate show-times, I believe, which is why I had to skip it. On your recommendation, will see if I can catch it next week.@Anil :DCopyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
