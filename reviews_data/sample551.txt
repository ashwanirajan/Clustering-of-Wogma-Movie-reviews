          Makhi has a concept, most of bollywood writers Missed in between three glorious decades ! #Movies
        
Yashviee:
          Liked Makkhi for its nice, fresh imagination.. although the film is a little dragged!
        
TadviManish:
          Makkhi is a more of a comedy than romantic, good script nice VFX but we have seen it in Robot  its a 2.5/5 for me Must watch one time.
        
SritikaDhar:
          So the ones who saw Aiyya are really regretting their decision.. while people like me who went for Makkhi are a lil better off..

AkhilaShankar:
          The day your folks ask you to watch makhi is the day you should come to term with the fact that they don't really like you
