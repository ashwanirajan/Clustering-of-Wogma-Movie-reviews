wogma rating: Add to 'must watch' list (?)
Aurangzeb makes the corrupt cop theme interesting. For that itself, it becomes worth a watch despite being a little drab and a little stretched out in the end.When I first heard of the film Aurangzeb, I wondered if it was going to be a periodic film. When I saw the suited Arjun Kapoor on posters, I wondered if it was about a son ousting his father from his proverbial throne - a business, a political party or even as the head of a mafia gang. But, from the trailer, it looks like another version of Don. After this initial disappointment though, there is some solace in the fact that the trailer didn't really look too bad and the film has Rishi Kapoor. I hope he is given a nice, meaty role to keep the interest going in Aurangzeb. There is also a chance that their take the story is different from what we've seen earlier. Another interesting bit is that the film is produced by Yash Raj Films. You don't really associate a crime film with this banner. But, then again, neither should have Tashan been associated with this banner (or any other!)I am 50-50 on this one from its promo material. How about you?Music Reviews:
glamsham - "2.5/5"
IBN Live - "'Aurangzeb' has interesting compositions and the music is well put together, but not an all round soundtrack as it won't appeal to the masses. "
Milliblog - "Aurangzeb has an interestingly thematic score, led by Vipin."

  As a skeleton, Aurangzeb comes across as Don with justification behind the sudden appearance of an underworld personality's look-alike. A look-alike who is willing to take the Don's place as a Police spy. But add on the flesh of complications and turbulences that the said justification brings along with it and you have an engaging, intriguing thriller. If only, it was a little less flat in its narration. It's been ages since I have seen a film that has worked so hard on a story; both in terms of the overall twists and turns and in bringing in the human factor to its relationships. That too on a theme as rundown as the underworld vs cops one. Of course, Aurangzeb is more than just that. It dwells on the themes of a father-son relationship from many angles. Interestingly, it doesn't dwell too much into the characters individually. Maybe that is why you don't get as involved as you could have been. Also later, the film does end up resorting to the most common thing that a gangster movie does to move the story ahead - kill someone. In that sense, one particular murder is more out of place and throws Aurangzeb into 'decent watch' categaory instead of 'must watch'. Otherwise, till this particular event, the film in fact, surprises you with its unpredictability. The change of hearts, for once, seem plausible. Motivations of the main players are clear enough for them to behave the way they do. And of course, the performances make all the events seem more believable than otherwise.Arjun Kapoor plays twin brothers, Ajay and Vishal well. He expresses the angst and turmoil well, however goes a little flat when he has to express the characters' softer side. Fortunately, Aurangzeb doesn't need him to show the mellow shades of characters for too long. You have an actor in a double role who does a good job and yet you have someone with a much smaller role outshine him. If you had to guess the name, Rishi Kapoor will be one of the people on that list. Even so, after Agneepath, this performance shouldn't surprise us at all. Prithviraj Sukumar remains his cool solemn-face self throughout and is teased by his screen wife about it too. Amruta Singh induces a slap-worthy performance which is good because her character invokes despise. Even with his two-minute role, Anupam Kher's face stayed back with me. Yet, I am glad they didn't add bits of his back-story just for the sake of it.Similarly, it is such a welcome relief to not see snazzy bits added in, just to make it 'commercially viable'. Whether in the name of item numbers or in terms of action sequences. Even if it means the narration feels drab as the movie progresses. Aurangzeb is one of those little surprises that makes you look forward to the director's next venture, even if you aren't completely satisfied with what was served this time. Just for the thought put in the story, just for making an otherwise done-to-death theme interesting, Aurangzeb is worth the watch.

          #Prithviraj delivers 2nd time arnd with #Aurangzeb. Even though the movie builds slowly it goes into top gear in 2nd half.

          'Aurangzeb' has a strong second half..the film belongs to Rishi Kapoor & Prithiviraj while Arjun shines in parts!

          Cant understand ppl liking SAW and calling #aurangzeb a dud. Powerful 1st half with only small slip ups. Intelligent till now.

BandishVora:
          Aurangzeb : Super movie. Brilliant dialogues.. Gripping till the end.. Excellent performance by Arjun Kapoor, Prithiviraj, Rishi Kapoor

          Kingship knows no kinship. - Aurangzeb 

One time watch movie. 2nd half thoda dry hain. But rishi kapoor s acting is the best.
        
SachinLalwani:
          Aurangzeb - A movie who's first half was good, couldn't concentrate on the second though.
        
rjstutee:
          While the plot is a little cumbersome gems like #rishikapoor #Jackieshroff #tanviazmi make it worth it! #Aurangzeb
        
PankajShuklaa:
          Aurangzeb is not a bad film, but it is certainly not a YRF fiilm. **

Could have been better !!
        
KamathGurudutt:
          Aurangzeb - interesting police thriller albeit convoluted, unbelievable, and filmi! Entertains to some extent. Script had a lot of potential

          #Aurangzeb good underutilized cast, drag for a story, but not an absolute lost cause, it is ok to watch once, #ramaursham in a new garb

          In other news, saw #Aurangzeb last night. I wonder why I bothered at all.
        
Vdaddy1230:
          After #SAW and #GoGoaGone, it's #Aurangzeb that goes haywire in the 2nd half. Dissapointed! Acting grt but long & boring,Overall: #dvd movie

          Aurangzeb gets 2 stars.

          Seemingly complex gangster flick turned out to be a family drama after 20 mins..! Too many sub plots spoilt it...! #Aurangzeb #Disappointing

          Phew. Finally the movie ended #Aurangzeb
        
gchikermane:
          The sole redeeming feature of #Aurangzeb is its excellent background score. Otherwise, the worst film I've seen in many, many years.

          Now after #Aurangzeb, I need to put all the alcohol in a bathing tub and just soak myself in it! Maybe I will recover from it. Pray!

: very good movie
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Really it Arjun Kapoor will go long.. movie trailors are nice plus rishi kapoor presence will surely increase the audienceOh well, time will tell :D(Note: This is first time I writing anything related to a movie)I am one of those who hardly watches any Hindi movies, but yesterday I went for late night show on my better half's insistence, and by the end of the movie I was glad I watched it. For a commercial Hindi movie to have such a good script is a rarity. In addition to that I think for a New comer, Arjun Kapoor gave a splendid performance - He may be the man to watch in the future. There was not a single boring moment in the movie and moved at a healthy pace. In most cases, you know the end of the movie by Interval, but Aurangzeb kept me guessing till about last 15 minutes..There were only 2 blemishes in the movie - that no-acting-only-skin-pug-faced whoever that girl is and the last fight sequence..@Arun Welcome to writing on films ;)I like the Rishi Kapoor presence in the movie. His role is incredile. So must watch this movie.@Nitin agree!Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.

Parental Guidance:


Violence: Quite a few gunshots and fist fights. Nothing too gory though.
Language: A few abusive words.
Nudity & Sexual content: A couple of kisses, a making out scene. Bikini clad women. Talk about escort girls and prostitution.
Concept: Are your personal ambitions bigger than your relationships
General Look and Feel: Set in urban Gurgaon for most parts, Aurangzeb has a gritty, steely feel about it.
