wogma rating: Add to 'must watch' list (?) - for campus romance lovers and those who like young rom-coms
    
  Mujhse Fraaandship Karoge is a kewl rom-com, if you like young, child-like fun. It's easy-going, well-edited and breezy-paced. The dialogue is witty and snappy, much like the characters. Campus romances have always occupied a soft corner in my heart. Like many of us, a huge portion of school and college revolved around "who likes who?" and what they are going to do about it. It took me back to those days, so, I 'like'.Mujhse Fraaanship Karoge - with a wannabe title like that, there isn't really much I expect from the film. That combined with falsifying identities to impress the opposite gender, sounds like we have a reasonably lame film at our hands. 
The actors are unknown and goes with Yash Raj Films inclination to encourage the talent in young India. But, at least the trailer doesn't give away if we are in for some good performances or not. Similarly, nothing much can be told about the writing except for the overall plot which seems like intentionally convoluted. 
Not too much dialogue is exposed in the promotional material either. The one major dialogue which shows up at minute 2:06 in the following trailer -

Is so similar to a scene from one of my favorite films, Chupke Chupke. Note in particular, the part of the dialogue that begins at minute 1:19 in the scene.
I don't really know how to react to such a blatant lift-off. All I can hope for is that it at least comes off as an apt tribute. And pray that there aren't too many of these tributes, rendering the film redundant. 
Anyway, heart goes out to an all-new crew. All I can say is good luck and hope you manage to entertain us!

  Have you ever noticed, that being around people younger than you, brings a spring in your step, makes you take life a little less seriously and deservedly so. Mujhse Fraaandship Karoge makes you spend two hours with regular yet vibrant twenty-one year-olds. And I don't know about that spring in the step, but it surely leaves a warm, mushy feeling. And despite all the predictability, the sharp dialogue and interesting characterization are good enough to make it worth the trip to the theaters.

There is only so much new that you can have in a girl-meets-boy story - somebody has to fall in love with somebody or someone has to live without someone . There is only that much more new you can expect from comic situations - there will be mistaken identities, there will be puns, there will be an attempt to infuse everyday, colloquial humor in the said situations and puns. Even if you come up with more such situations, hardly anything is going to be novel. 
The devil then lies in the details. And Mujhse Fraaandship Karoge does a wonderful job of getting the mini-situations in the situations, right. The lines are clever, they are delivered smartly and with control. Some of the back and forth between characters is so quick, that you miss what is told. Not the annoying hurried, quick. The kind of pacy dialogue that makes you sure, that you missed something good, given the tone of the film. 
Full credit to the almost brand new cast. From the main foursome, to the character roles - they are all played out well. I completely enjoyed Saqib Saleem and Saba Azad's performances. They annoy and entertain appropriately. 
Mujhse Fraaandship Karoge sticks to the genre it picks. It is not setting out to say anything profusely profound, but in its little way, it leaves around little quotable quotes and witticisms. Though the film never says it out loud, the overall impact is that - love is beyond a "hot" body and online personas. The next logical step is a story about how outdoor sports scores over the online "dhishoom-dhoosh!"
Of course, there is the underlying assumption that most urban romances are online rather than offline. We can argue about whether this is true or not, but the point is having made that assumption, the writers have a story to tell. They tell it well, and the director ably guides the youthful spirit of the story. 
In this particular case, the well-paced narration and the slick editing has a lot to add to the fresh feel of the film. The songs needed to have a little more zing. Except for the "dhyaun dhyaun" song, they are all pretty lame. But, they are again, elevated by the way they are edited. So brisk is the movement that you don't feel like you are listening to something average. 
Yes, I gladly take back all the nasty things I had to say after seeing the promo of the film. A decent film is so worth having to eat my words. Do I have a choice, considering a predictable boy-meets-girl story, with an unexplained transformation in character, created a string of moments that brought a tear to me eye?

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.So it's more or less avoidable type of movie I think?ultimate muvie guys.......... enjoyed a lot...... will  see it again definately..... thumbs up......@ajith no! it's very watchable!@Sushant :D@suman pretty cool, no? did you expect it to be this likeable?It is so goooooood!! Okay, only except the last yashraj-ished/Bollywoodized lame lame lame part. Watched it only because you said it was a must watch. Also because it was available on Netflix :PPerformances are fantastic! For once, I was really happy with the casting. Also, you do a great job with the review!! Because I could never have thought of writing anything like that. I am going to promote your review and the film now.@intelshwets Thank you!
