Medical science and the super-natural power of seeing dead people are mixed. This would have been fine if the light vein didn’t mix so abruptly but with the overflow of sentiments. Ultimately we are left with a dissatisfactory resolution which seems unintentional.NOT A REVIEW - Just wondering if seeing dead people could be funny or romantic, it's a rom-com they say…Arshad Warsi used to be an actor whose films I'd look forward to, even if he played a character role. Off late however, his comedy flicks have been a complete turn-off. He acts well and all that but the scrip selection has been not too short of torture.Hum Tum aur Ghost might, just might, be a break from that. For it has been written and produced by Arshad himself. Though there is that chicken-and-egg question. Did he produce a film because he wanted to cast himself as a lead actor or did he become the lead actor because he was producing the film? Either ways the intention doesn't look perfect.Somehow, so gelled is that image of Arshad Warsi as a side-hero, that it is really not easy to imagine him carrying a film off on his own. Same applies to the lead lady, Dia Mirza too. She's sweet, she's pretty, but because she's never really been cast by herself in the lead role, it's difficult not to look around for more girl-power in the film. Sure, she was the only woman actor in Acid FactoryThese images combined with the over-powering stature and lure of the ongoing IPL tournament are already negatives in the Hum Tum aur Ghost profit and loss statement. But this bit of news has aroused my curiosity a bit more than normal. The writer/producer Arshad Warsi and director Kabeer had a row due to creative differences. It was supposedly because of the treatment the film was being given. Arshad wants a light film but Kabeer is more interested in giving it a serious look. The funniest bit is this - 
So we decided that let the editor [Steven] decide what's best for the film. We decided to step out of the editing suite and let him take the decision.Really now? This is some education for me in film-making or 'behind-the-scenes'! Not only does the editor have the power to decide on the treatment, it is actually possible to decide on the tone of the film in post-production?! How? I mean, how?Anyway, turns out Arshad won that one. Come March 26 we will know whether it was a good one over the serious, "I see dead people"Meanwhile enjoy the cinematography of the first Hindi film shot in Newcastle -

  There’s a lot of confusion - in the story and in the execution. As is true of many stories that deal with paranormal and mental health, Hum Tum Aur Ghost too, shuttles between the two. Some take sides, some argue it out like a drawing room conversation. Here they don’t do either very intentionally. Which is refreshing but in turn they don’t get the audience involved in the story either.

Unfortunately this is despite trying really hard. Really hard to create sweet moments between Arman and Gehna (Arshad Warsi and Dia Mirza) and friendships between Arman and Mini (Sandhya Mridul) or Arman and Mr. Kapoor (Boman Irani) ; really hard to create comic drama around the mystery surrounding Arman’s “condition”; really hard to make the subject and story interesting. 
I felt like a pendulum that sways from subtle comedy to serious drama. And the shifts are pretty abrupt. As abrupt as some of the scenes are stuck together – literally looks like the film was randomly chopped and glued together. It was extremely disorienting. 
The entire cast looks like they have made a good-faith attempt at getting into character. You see romance and sweet nothings being exchanged. They should have brought that “aawwww” moments, but no such luck. The emotions look way to superficial. 
The saving grace though is that some of the comic lines are as subtly slid in as they are funny - very. But they are also very few and quite far between. And the sudden tone shift between funny and display of emotions doesn’t help either. 
Ultimately, the entire film feels like one big trial, a rehearsal for a mediocre show. The confusion in the minds of the makers is way too transparent. Maybe the only situation in which I’d say, I don’t want the thoughts of the writer/director to show through to me.
