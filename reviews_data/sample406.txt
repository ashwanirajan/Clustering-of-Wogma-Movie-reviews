Well tried. But, you expect a few more thrills from a thriller with sharks and expanses of open water.Warning's trailer gets you mildly intrigued. Sure, it doesn't give away anything more than a few friends are out on a boat and they might be drowning. But, that's what makes it interesting - that it doesn't give away what it is about. A general pointer towards the genre and Jaws, and that's about it.And of course, that it is in 3D with lots of water and barely-clad men and women. The music too seems to be only promotional material. I must say I enjoyed the surreal water theme across all the promotional material including the music videos.Whether it will be a thriller worth watching at all, we'll know soon enough. Going to walk in with a completely blank slate for once.

  A theme that involves a bunch of people stuck in a tight life or death situation can invoke only so much thrill. Especially, if you are exposed to thrillers.  You know some will die, some will make it. You know bad things will happen and either the characters will find a way out or not. The mystery of whether or not happens by itself isn't intriguing enough. Then what is it that hooks the audience in, if at all? Characters? Atmosphere? You need that extra spark to keep you with the film, which unfortunately is wanting in Warning. What Warning has though is an urge to do something that has rarely, if ever, been tried in Hindi films - use vast expanses of water to create a chilling atmosphere. It succeeds at times, and not so much at others but the effort to do something new is not lost on the audience. A large part of what didn't work can be attributed to the loss of brightness due to 3D. I won't say the 3D was bad, because it does shake you up a bit when a shark comes your way, if only the water was bluer maybe the film wouldn't come across as dull.True, once the situation sets in, there is hardly any up or down in the arc of the story. You have your regular drill of the blame-game, self-blame, introspection people bonding and/or fighting and so on.  There are huge group dynamics that can be explored in situations like this. But, neither the thrill element nor the human angle is touched upon more than superficially. It helps then that the actors do a decent job put together. Except for the French speaking woman who looks out-of-place, maybe intentionally, the rest of the cast goes about alternating between supportive, scared, strong, sad and so on pretty well. Another thing that worked well was the claustrophobia created by the open space that the ocean is. By the end of the film, you could feel your skin shrivel as if you were in the water for those over 1.5 hours. I don't know if I should happy then that an attempt was made or be unhappy that it wasn't taken a level deeper to engage and/or explore.

Twitter reviews for this movie are not available.No readers have rated this movie yet.This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.seems like its based on Piranhas.@mac Haven't seen that one. But from what I hear, just maybe.The commercial prospects of this film would definitely have been boosted had they just had a few "barely clad" women and done away with the men. Who wouldn't fancy a few bikini clad damsels in distress even if the plot's worth nothing at all! ;)Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.

Parental Guidance:


Violence: A few slaps and scenes where people beat each other or themselves up. A shark attack.
Language: Largely clean
Nudity & Sexual content: No sexual content. But bikini-clad and bare-backed women, shirtless men and so on.
Concept: A story of survival. 
General Look and Feel: 95% of the film is where the characters are in water.
