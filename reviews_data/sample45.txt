Ace rate dialogue and performances. The topic isn't broached often enough in films. But once it is, we know where it's headed, making this film predictable too.It is only apt that the censor board wanted to censor a whole lot – it is about women's liberty after all.  When husbands and boyfriends, fathers and brothers, some times the women in their lives too, extended family, society, governments – all want a say in that liberty, why not the censor board?The metaphor of a “burkha” is underlined, emboldened and italicised – just in case you miss it. Every dialogue, every frame is a social remark, especially in the first half. The comment is that about oppression under the garb of protection, tradition, culture and so on. Fortunately, the stifled voices don't get preachy, even though they are empowered, alright. The comment is left at that, in stating the fact as a fact. This stays true to the texture of the film too. If the film provided an over-arching solution, it would be quite out of place. In that sense, Lipstick Under My Burkha has a perfect climax. Also, well done by the writing department is the dialogue and its delivery. The lines are snappy and people talk like people and not actors. The main characters – none of whom are “right” in what they are doing. If only, the “villains” of their lives were not so one-dimensional. Then again, that is what these people become for stifled women – villains, be it a father or the society at large. That is how these women make you feel for them. Each of these women – Leela (Aahana Kumra), Rehana (Plabita Borthakur), Shirin (Konkona Sen Sharma), Usha (Ratna Pathak Shah) - do what they really want to do. Yet, it is the struggle they have to go through, both internal and external, which makes them even more real.Of course, that is all due to the spot-on depiction by Ratna Pathak Shah, Konkona Sen Sharma, Aahana Kumra and Plabita Borthakur. Ratna Pathak Shah has the most difficult task at hand. The biggest bit is to depict the sexuality of a 55-year old, but her character is also the strength of many around her. This contrast between being a support system and yet needing a hand to hold is very rarely seen in Hindi films. This is the kind of greyness in character that makes you identify with the film's characters. Even if you are not 55 nor 17 like the characters; even if you are not a suppressed housewife or an outgoing woman with desires of her own, you know an aunt, a cousin, a friend who is/has been there. Which is what makes you let go of the skewed take on gender. For that aunt, cousin or friend the world is indeed a dark cage. Does it mean we paint all men with a broad stroke of black then? That doesn't seem right or real either. It is this, even if not overt, male-bashing and the self-pity that it masks that bothered me after a while. Like many “social issue” films, it is difficult to look at movies like Lipstick Under My Burkha, as just a story - like say a story of these 4 women of different ages, from different religions, with different support systems who happen to live in one area of a big city. You cannot not think of the issue they want to discuss. The movie clearly has an agenda and flaunts it on its sleeve. If it is the agenda then, I know it, I live it. Men are not all mean. The level-headed ones might not be living it, but they know and are supportive of it – at home, in the workplace. The other men are unlikely to see the film. Even if they do, they are more likely to laugh at Ushaji (like the few men in the audience where I saw the film) than become sensitive to her desires as real. How does this help? I wouldn't have asked this question had it not come across as the one thing the film wanted to do – sensitize the viewer. Even so, Lipstick Under My Burkha can  be watched for its snappy dialogue and sensitive, intense performances.

        ...It moves with seductive stealth through the lives of the four women but does not eventually evoke the memorable images from the great feminist and post-feminist films of Indian cinema including Parched. Nonetheless this is a vital and in many ways, great film more remarkable for what it doesn’t say about women who long for sexual salvation than what it does say, so explicitly.

But to Sensharma and Pathak belong the film's finest moments, some that make you giggle and others that make you feel their pain. "Pata hai hamari galti kya hai? [You know what's the mistake we make]" asks Leela to Shirin whose silence and moist eyes speak volumes of her relationship with her husband. "Hum sapne bahut dekhti hai. [We dream a lot]" Shrivastava's film is a plea for women to not give up on their dreams and their voices silenced in the patriarchal society. That she does it without being preachy and in an engaging mode makes her film even better....

Despite projecting ourselves as a developing nation that aims to be a superpower in the future, the fact remains that we are largely a socially, culturally and religiously conservative country that needs to evolve vastly before it can hope to achieve any of these things. The importance of gender equality is widely discussed all over the globe. This discussion needs to pick up pace in countries like India where women ago through different kinds of suppression on a daily basis. The fact that this film was initially denied a certificate by the Censor Board for being 'lady-oriented' says it all.

I’m going with three-and-a-half out of five for Lipstick Under My Burkha. It’s accessible and entertaining; that rare film about empowerment that delivers plenty laughs. Make sure not to miss it.

          I think expectations 'ruined' Lipstick under my Burkha for me. I may have liked it better had it not been for all the brouhaha. But nice.
        
simple_sy:
          Caught Lipstick Under My Burkha last night. Liked the storytelling, not so much the story.

startafresh4:
          A sincere yet failed attempt. Lipstick under my burkha disappoints and falls a tad too short to meet exceptions.
        
siddhya:
          It does make the audience uncomfortable, as it should.

            Yay! Thumbs Up,

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.General Look and Feel: It is a grungy, Mumbai set-up portraying stifled lives.It is Bhopal, not Mumbai. It is mentioned  quite a  couple of times in the movie...1. Bhopal ki Britney2. The 1984 gas tragedyError fixed. Thank you so much, Minu. And apologies for the error.It is a nice film.  It is the need of the hour, to recognize and give the freedom to our mother, sister, wife, daughter.  Recognition might be there but often the giving part is missing.Before deciding to watch the film, please read carefully the parental guidance rating above.  Many scenes are extremely uncomfortable to watch in family.  They are very sexplicit.Coming to the censor board controversy.  As per my understanding the bone of contention was not the adults content, that is easily managed with an "A" certificate.  The issue on hand is the portrayal of Muslims as ultra conservative and patriarchal.  Films should not and must not be allowed to malign an entire region, community, religion (remember the generic maligning of Punjabis by a certain Kashyap guy?).  The film clearly gives the message against a community, even if that was not intended.  There was no balancing act done by showing a liberal Muslim family.  And that is incorrect to portray.  This portrayal is equivalent to saying every Muslim is a terrorist; which as everyone accepts is wrong.  Now we can always debate if it is the job of the Indian Censor Board to discourage films from inciting religious hatred. I believe that there has to be a watchdog, referee, umpire, whatever you want to name to ensure a fair match.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.

Parental Guidance:


Violence: A scene with man slapping his wife
Language: Abusive words
Nudity & Sexual content: Sex is not the only, but a predominant theme. Lots of liplocks, a few making-out scenes and a couple scenes where the couple is having sex.
Concept: The cage that women stay in – sexual, economic, expression, etc.
General Look and Feel: It is a grungy, Mumbai Indian small-town set-up portraying stifled lives. (Error rectified thanks to reader, Minu)
