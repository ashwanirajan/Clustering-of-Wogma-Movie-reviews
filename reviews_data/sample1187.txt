wogma rating: Watch if you have nothing better to do (?)
Two hard laughs, two emotional scenes and an attempt to evoke patriotism in the Indian cinema goer. Worked for some, didn't work for the rest of us. Akshay Kumar gives an appreciably controlled performance and while Katrina Kaif gives her best so far, yet leaves loads of room for improvement. The story has way too many holes. Then again, we can't expect anything more in a romantic comedy.I felt sad while watching this movie…really really sad. No, it had nothing to do with the generally predictable storyline. It was also not because I saw too many genres being mixed to no particular end. It was the songs. Don’t get me wrong, they had awesome lighting! I am certainly not saying I expected better from Himesh Reshammiya. Its not the video album style picturisation either. But, Jaaved Saahab? “Aanan-Faanan”, “Rafta rafta”, “Chakna chakna”? Your poetry has moved me to tears many a time, and this time too, but obviously for all the wrong reasons. I am grieving because it feels like we are losing you Sir, to the inane-word-rhyming competition.

Oh well, coming back to the story. It heavily draws from , Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam (the sacrificing husband), Purab Aur Paschim (the patriotism bit). Cinematically, the parts shot in Punjab reminded me of Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jaayenge. One scene particularly reminded me of Dil Hai Ki Manta Nahi - would give away a little more than I like, if I said which one. In that sense then, they were original because they were the ones who thought of the combination! While there are some scenes that go contrary to your predictions, they are so unreal or out-of-place with the characterizations that they would make more sense as dream sequences. 
Akshay Kumar almost plays himself – a Punjabi dude who listens to music on an ipod while sporting a pink silk kurta – but with a remarkable amount of restraint. He doesn’t get loud or go over-the-top. The flaw is actually in his character which forgets his Jatt pride because he is head-over-heels in love with the lady of his life. Katrina looks dainty and has her share of expressions. This might very well be her best performance till date. Wait dear, that is not a compliment just yet. 
Javed Shaikh (Parvez Khan) could use a lesson or two from Rishi Kapoor and Nina Wadia (his wife) for body language and dialogue delivery. The only reason for Upen Patel’s track to exist is the ‘Western Union’ advertisement. I kid you not, they had to put an advertisement they had shot with Upen Patel and Katrina Kaif in it and that is why they chose this cast. That would also explain why Upen Patel was acting like he was a model – to maintain consistency. 
The entertainment in the movie is very sporadic. There are two sequences which really work because of their humor. These are not jokes you could narrate; it’s the way it’s done on screen that makes you laugh your heart out. That I guess makes the movie a comedy. There are a couple of emotional scenes where you really feel sorry for Arjun (Akshay Kumar). There’s the romance for you. 
Then there is the routine of a foreigner belittling the capabilities of Indians, and an Indian giving it back to them and rightly so, with a slap across their face but sans violence. The good thing about the dialogue is that it is well delivered and that it doesn’t get preachy about Indian culture and tradition. It just states facts. Soon enough, it digresses into some irrelevant facts and loses all grace. 
It’s the reinforced stereotypes that got tiring. The racism - all white people (except one in this case) are mean to Asians and don’t take a breather before ridiculing them. The fight of cultures - all the second generation immigrants do is drink, shop and party. And all first generation Indian immigrants make no attempt to socialize with the natives of the country they migrate into. In fact, they are so desperate to get their daughter an Indian groom, that they take pride when an Indian guy eve-teases her?!? Why is it painted so black and white and inevitably the black turning into white (no pun intended)? 
Anyway, shouldn’t patriotism be stimulated more often than the few times an Indian actor gives a mouthful to the side character – who exists for the sole purpose of being whacked verbally anyway– in a movie? Shouldn’t we wait at least until a match starts before bashing our cricket team? Oh, look who is digressing now…
Maybe, its pure bad timing. Two movies released in a day both of which deal with the troubles of NRIs and the cultural disparities. Three in eight days. Too much of the same thing not presented in a very different way?

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Warning: this section has some details that could distort your experience while watching the movie. I strongly recommend reading this only after you have seen the movie or if you have decided not to see it.First generation Indian immigrant Rishi Kapoor desperately wants to get his daughter, Jasmeet aka Jazz to get married to a Punjabi guy. She obviously is not interested. How the tug of war takes off and lands is for you to find out if you are interested, that is.First generation Indian immigrant Rishi Kapoor desperately wants to get his daughter, Jasmeet aka Jazz to get married to a Punjabi guy.

The lighting of the whole sequence of the India trip.
The groom-hunt is hilarious!!!
The Arjun-Jazz flash forward scene.

Here are other things that Anurag Anand, a reader,  liked -

The 'Maori style' Rugby celebrations by Rishi Kapoor.
The authentic depiction of Punjab...haven't seen Punjabi locales being
captured so well, not even in Veer Zaara or Gadar (Gulzar's Maachis captured
it well, but not so colourfully).
Thank you Anurag!

What did not
Note: This section simply lists the things that I did not like in this movie. This is not the overall impression about this movie. Please read the full review here

Two scenes, one with Katrina Kaif and the other with Rishi Kapoor, have them walking/running straight after they are completely drunk.
Did they really have to show Jazz going to work, tapping two keys on the computer keyboard and leaving? That she didn't really need to work because she was seeing her boss was obvious, right?
Why was Jazz happily dancing in the farms and churning malai when she intended to run away? The idea of going with the flow was Imran's, not hers.
The music that was playing at a Punjabi wedding, just didn't seem right.
If Jazz has such an attitude, why is she still living with her parents?
Why does Imran go to the mosque when he was just going to change his religion? To say good-bye to his religion just does not make sense.
Katrina Kaif's accent - it was more American than British.
In the Anurag-Jazz flashforward sequence, Katrina Kaif reminded me of Riteish Deshmukh dressed as woman (Apna Sapna Money Money)

Nitty-Gritty
This section lists things that I think are not important to the overall impact of the movie. In most cases, it could be explained away by something like, "we noticed the glitch after the scene was shot and there were schedule/budget issues and thus we could not re-shoot it". I like giving the makers the benefit of doubt, but I am amused nevertheless. Hopefully, they will tickle you too.

There was something wrong with the print quality in the first half hour of the movie (in the theater where I saw it). Everything seemed a little out of focus. I hope it was just this print.
Katrina Kaif's dubbing seemed a little off.
Upen Patel had a feather-weight suitcase when he moved out of his parents' house.
Behold our man of the hour, Arjun, who can charge car batteries without so much as looking at the car, let alone looking at the engine.
Why  were the girls giggling while giving Jazz lassi? She wasn't even a handsome man for goodness sake! 
Did they really have to make Rishi Kapoor eating malai, so gross?
Not only does Western Union transfer money in a few minutes. You don't need to sign a receipt or show any identification when you take the money. 
One candle is still burning when Imran cuts his birthday cake.
In "Dil-e-beqaraar",  were Arjun and Jazz together or not in the "shoe" stanza? The picturization is confusing. In the same song, the guard at the ticket counter allows two people to go on one ticket - in London!

Did they really have to show Jazz going to work, tapping two keys on the computer keyboard and leaving? That she didn't really need to work because she was seeing her boss was obvious, right?
Why was Jazz happily dancing in the farms and churning malai when she intended to run away? The idea of going with the flow was Imran's, not hers.
The music that was playing at a Punjabi wedding, just didn't seem right.
If Jazz has such an attitude, why is she still living with her parents?
Why does Imran go to the mosque when he was just going to change his religion? To say good-bye to his religion just does not make sense.
Katrina Kaif's accent - it was more American than British.
In the Anurag-Jazz flashforward sequence, Katrina Kaif reminded me of Riteish Deshmukh dressed as woman (Apna Sapna Money Money)

There was something wrong with the print quality in the first half hour of the movie (in the theater where I saw it). Everything seemed a little out of focus. I hope it was just this print.
Katrina Kaif's dubbing seemed a little off.
Upen Patel had a feather-weight suitcase when he moved out of his parents' house.
Behold our man of the hour, Arjun, who can charge car batteries without so much as looking at the car, let alone looking at the engine.
Why  were the girls giggling while giving Jazz lassi? She wasn't even a handsome man for goodness sake! 
Did they really have to make Rishi Kapoor eating malai, so gross?
Not only does Western Union transfer money in a few minutes. You don't need to sign a receipt or show any identification when you take the money. 
One candle is still burning when Imran cuts his birthday cake.
In "Dil-e-beqaraar",  were Arjun and Jazz together or not in the "shoe" stanza? The picturization is confusing. In the same song, the guard at the ticket counter allows two people to go on one ticket - in London!
Aaliyah, you got me all wrong there. I *did not* think the songs in this movie had any poetry whatsoever and that is what I was complaining about. I am talking about being moved by the other poetries that the lyricist, Javed Akhtar has written. But, please do not let this keep you from renewing your membership. You will surely come across much better products from this industry.hi i liked this movie,and i loved all the songs of the filmGood but more explaination should be provided ....some pictures should be showed ....and a little bit of video.....i like this  and all the songs of the movie  gud moviethis movie songs are good. i cannot tell in words about this movieok thats alli like this movie and songs very much. its a vry good M.rocking movie maaaaaaaan  !!ah ...what can i said abt this movie.... its really a nice movie to watch ...katrina is  looking really a british by her look and by her style ...and akshay he looks superb in this movie .....all nd all i can say its on e of my fav movie i have ever watched"music is good $ himesh is best""movie was ok $ katrina does not know the acting"[...] Namastey London is still entertaining???
