A relatively engaging last half hour. Only if you can sit through gun fight after gun fight after gun fight that is typical of a film based in the underworld.The trailer has a very Sarkar-esque feel to it. Which also means it has the Ram Gopal Varma touch to it. Now, that could really go either way, but one will walk into the theater with skepticism.The story again, doesn't seem to be any different from the other mafia leader-Robinhood stories we have seen plenty of. The only thing that seems worth looking forward to is Arjun Rampal as Arun Gawli. The make-up, the beetlenut-stuffed mouth seems to be spot on. Hope the rest of the performance follows through. And of course, I hope against hope that the story has some other factor that differentiates it from the rest of the films in this sub-genre – more depth, if nothing else. Else, the question would remain unanswered – are all these films as close to reality as it gets or is this film keeping arms distance from reality too?Daddy releases on 8 September, 2017Music Review:

  There is nothing remarkable about Daddy for about an hour and a half of the film. The film looks and feels like any other mafia gang war film and the story is exactly that too. The last half hour or so has some actual meat to it, showing us a peek into what Arun Gawli (Arjun Rampal) thought and did. While relentless gun fights, gory violence included, is a given in a film of this genre, the narrative tool used was the most off-putting. You follow Inspector Vijay (Nishikant Kamat) as he interviews people close to Gawli – his mother, his associates, his friend's girlfriend and so on. Which would have been fine, if he was learning about Gawli along with the audience. Here, the inspector clearly ought to have known whatever he was interrogating about in the first place and in fact even says so at one point. This “tell, don't show” structure kept me at an arm's distance through most of the film.It doesn't help that the subject of the film – the glorification of a renown mafia leader – isn't enticing in the first place. Even if he took from the rich to give to the poor, even if he wished to reform himself, even if his heart was never into violence to begin with – his misdeeds aren't easily forgivable. Also, there is always a nagging feeling that under the garb of an impartial take, there still lies a bias in the story-telling. I strongly sensed that we weren't being given the whole story made a little more obvious by the gaping holes in the story. There were other elements in the story that seemed more gratuitious than the need of the situation. These mostly related to the scenes with sexual intimacy. Given the context, none of them made them were a necessary part of the story. Fortunately, you have believable performances across the board. The action-heavy nature of the film doesn't necessarily need a huge variety of emoting, but Arjun Rampal, Nishikant Kamat, Aishwarya Rajesh, Rajesh Shringarpore keep things real. In terms of the milieu too, the grungy, sepia tone works. I must say though, the men's hairstyles were quite distracting. Many of them felt like they were uncomfortable in their wigs instead of the hairdo blending with the characters.Daddy, comes across as an earnest defense for one of the most feared men of his times. I lived in Mumbai during those times. I don't remember hearing of any of his Robinhood deeds. Maybe they were deliberately kept under wraps. If this film was made to invoke sympathy for a man who might wrongfully be in prison today, it didn't really do much in that direction. Lacking balance, it just might have pushed the audience, that can be bothered to care, even further in the other direction.

Arjun Rampal’s sincere act of the reluctant Robin Hood like don seeking to go legit via politics, though easily one of his better performances, still makes Gawli come off as one of the duller characters of the film. But to be fair to him, Gawli’s characterization too plays a hand in this. And Farhan Akhtar’s casting as Dawood (called Maqsood here) just doesn’t come off. Script problems aside, just taking care of these two issues could have resulted in a cracker of a film. As it is, Daddy ends up as an undeniably good effort but has you ruing that it could have been so much more.
