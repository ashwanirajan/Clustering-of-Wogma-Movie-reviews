wogma rating: Watch if you have nothing better to do (?)
This is a perfect 21st century hindi masala flick - action, drama, romance, comedy, animation, song, dance, dudes, chicks and NO STORY! There are a few, very amusing scenes and the music sounds good, but the whole thing is very shoddily put together.Just because of the comedy scenes every once in a while,
this movie's ranking is saved from being at the bottom of the pile.
- Due credit goes to Ajay Devgan's timing and the dialogues too.
This makes it worth a watch, but only if you have nothing better to do.

Just because I have to find a new way to complain, 
I'm wondering what we did to deserve the maker's disarray. 
- If they were given a chance to explain, 
Here is what I think they would have to say -
Just because this is an action flick, 
Glitter, style and oomph is all we feed. 
- good dialogues, acting is for lesser mortals,
cleavages and speedy vehicles is the hour's need.
Just because we wanted to get creative, here is what we did - 
We started an action heist movie at a slow pace and we stuck to it.
- At times we used repetitive dialogue to make every point clear, 
at others we thought viewers are sharp, as if they knew what we knew.
Just because we have a story board, 
doesn't mean we have to have a story, you see.
- four long-haired dudes, boat, bike, skate-board,
and a brilliantly-endowed babe to each, where's the necessity? 
Just because we have eight personalities,
Who says they need their own individual identities? 
- they all have the exact same attitude: cop, anti-hero or villain,
and they all love to make their cars do a screeching U-turn.
Just because we ran out of money to make other things screech,
We won't cut the length; we'll use animation - ugly and cheap.
- the editor then, will earn his buck - lots of interspersing to do,
You may have seen it in Hollywood, but we do it with better ado.
Just because we have an audience,
they don't need orientation to any thing or place.
- whether it is how characters know what they know,
or who is where, to do what and is fighting whom on the show.
Just because, we had a few songs in store,
we had to get as many girls dancing to the score,
- for you we imported from Brazil an item number-er. 
Why we left Dia no song, is for you to gossip-monger
Just because we made a foot-tapping fusion with Indian and misirlou,
we know the records will sell, no matter what we do with the other few.
- they come at regular intervals - exactly when one is overdue.
the dancers don't get groovy moves, but you will shake a leg or two
Just because this writer wants this to look like poetry, 
doesn't mean she will stick to a meter or go on a rhyming spree.

    - meeta, a part of the audience

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Warning: this section has some details that could distort your experience while watching the movie. I strongly recommend reading this only after you have seen the movie or if you have decided not to see it.A bunch of thieves want to rob a bunch of diamonds.A bunch of thieves want to rob a bunch of diamonds.
Riteish Deshmukh's entry on a skate board. The action choreography is cool. 
A couple of jokes given to Riteish Deshmukh are really funny.
The scene where Shayina's (Shamita Shetty's) car breaks down. It was a good blend of comedy, action and romance.
Some action scenes were really cool - silly but cool! Like the "kabbadi" with cars sequence.
The use of red and black in "Reham kare"

Just because they had Riya (Ayesha Takia), they had to put her to some use. They made her the smiley audience to an irritating, poor poor-joke-cracking narrative.
It's really sad when in an action movie - which has speed as a major form action - the only way to gauge the speed of the vehicle is through the expressions of the actors.
Where exactly is Angad (Sunil Shetty) when he is shown for the first time? First he is shown on a bike, then a few seconds later on a boat.
Did Pooja's (Esha Deol's) house have two entrances? If yes, then, it was very convenient that the two guys arrived at the same time but from two different entrances.
Was Shayina (Shamita Shetty) supposed to be a smart security officer or not? How come she acted plain dumb at times, like when she doesn't see her name on the cake?
What kind of a security system does the museum where the painting lies have? How could Lucky (Riteish Deshmukh) just pick the painting up, without any alarms going off?
How did the police know that Danny (Zayed Khan) was going to be in the water? Lucky had already lost the cops on his way to Danny.
Why did Danny set-off a blast in the water near the boat?
The van that carried the money in Shayina's convoy was blasted on the top. How come it kept running without interruption and the only damage caused was the hole on the top?
Why were Pooja, Lucky and Danny called in the night club by Doc (Ajay Devgan), where the song "Reham kare" was played? 
Why didn't the police arrive at Angad's (Sunil Shetty's) place?
How and why does everybody reach Pooja's house?
Where does everybody get all their cool vehicles from for the last fight sequence?

When Lucky (Riteish Deshmukh) and Danny (Zayed Khan) are robbing the bank in France, what is the bank security service doing? How come they come in so late?
The sound effect of a Volkswagon Beetle starting sounded like that of a bike.
Was Karan (Ajay Devgan) staying in a building or a bungalow? The entrance alley looked like it was a building but the rest of the place looked like a bungalow.
Why is it raining 10 dollar bills on Karan long after Pooja, Danny and Lucky are done throwing the money at him?
Review - Cash...This is a perfect 21st century hindi masala flick - action, drama, romance, comedy, animation, song, dance, dudes, chicks and NO STORY! There are a few, very amusing scenes and the music sounds good, but the whole thing is very shoddily put together. M...BROTHERS & SISTERS DONT watch CASH if1* IF U HAVE HUUUUGE EXPECTATIONS from this FILM...2* IF U DONT LIKE ACTION FLICKS...3* IF U DONT HAVE BRAINS or if u have it & U DONT LIKE TO USE IT !!! 4* IF U NEED A REASON & DETAIL of each & every scene in a MOVIE... (coz MANY MANY & MANY SCENES goes (OVER-the-HEAD)...ANUBHAV SINHA seems to PRACTISE for his NXT FILM in CASH itself as his MOVIE will be AN FULL-FLEGED ANIMATION FILM named "SHLOK"...The use of ANIMATION, ek hadd tak theek tha BUT FILM mein kuch zyaada hi ho gaya tha [:P]....[...] reviews Cash.

Aren't movies "supposed" to narrate stories. Action movies should at least have a coherent plot. By the way, Cash didn't even have "cool" action. It was old stuff repeated over and over.Cricketers get hurt while playing a match/during practice. Do we stop complaining when the team we favor loses? It's a part of their job to get hurt.
