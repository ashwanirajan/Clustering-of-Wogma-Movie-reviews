Four losers bond over some foolish plans to make it rich quick. Quirky and fun in the second half, it is a pain to go through in the first half though.You can tell the writers of Fukrey are in love with their characters and it is a joy to see the writers so invested in their characters. Except they get carried away. The introduction is so slow that even when fun quirkiness sets in, you have to literally been jerked out of drowsiness. The character exposition is so tardy and lacklustre that you wonder how you are going to spend the next two hours. And while it is good to see writers who care so deeply about the audience's understanding of the characters, they don't go beyond the initial set-up. As the movie develops, you don't really discover anything new, let alone interesting about most of the characters. However, as the movie progresses a couple of characters get into their element and bring life into the film, Chucha (Varun Sharma) and Bholi Punjabi (Richa Chaddha). Their characters' quirks and the language they use add zing to the film. That Chucha uses his dreams to win lotteries combined with his outlandish sense of humor, gradually wake you up and you begin to expect a peak in the film's comedy.  Bholi's brash lady-goon reminds you of Neha Dhupia's Munni gangster from Phas Gaya Re Obama and you are happy that you are enjoying her role better. She seems more at home with the language and the mannerisms.Yet, only two characters and the actors who perform them can take a movie only so far. Also ultimately, the movie wants to become greater than what it has been so far and forces a message in. In addition, there is this fact that all the main characters are pretty much losers who you don't feel much for or identify with. Sure, the two characters take away a lot of the credit, but the other actors do a great job too. Especially the women, Vishakha Singh and Priya Anand. I especially enjoyed scenes between Priya Anand and Pulkit Samrat where they communicate with their eyes. Hilarious and romantic moments at the same time. Also,though  Pankaj Tripathi's role seems too small to warrant an actor of his calibre, he of course, does well with what he has.Yet, with all that's going well for Fukrey, at 2.5+ hours, there is a lot that isn't. There isn't enough for you to warrant a trip to the theaters. Finally, I'll always remember Fukrey as the film that started with a guy peeing and cracking some toilet joke. Even so, a film in which the director and writer tried. A DVD watch where you can skip the first half sounds more like it.

: Poor 'Delhi Belly' wannabe
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Thanks a lot for the review. I have not seen the movie yet but since its from the production house of Farhan Akhtar and Ritesh Sidhwani , i have high hopes from this movie. But like you said there are some errors , which is unfortunate. Actually in India there are very less movies with target audience as youngsters, movie industry in India makes family movies mainly. So going by that thumbs up for the makers of this movies for the effort. However like you mentioned movie is just average which is disappointing.@Meetu : Is it ever possible for u to actually "like" a movie...you're one fussy girl i must say :P  1 +ve for about 10 -ve's...that's how most of your reviews go :D@majaal yep! But I'm a little confused, did you see the movie?@Anuj Yeah, maybe that is why I wanted my voice heard and started the blog. ;) I must add though, that there are few people who think I go easy. They'd  have loved to trash a film completely, but I have at least something positive to say about the film. :DI was told my many over the past week that this is the "movie of the year", so I naturally went in with very high expectations, almost expecting another big surprise a la Vicky Donor. Suffice to say, I was thoroughly disappointed. I agree with most of Meetu's review, except the praise for Bholi Panjaban, which I thought was a character that was over exaggerated and overly "in your face". The only saving grace for me was Varun Sharma as Chucha, which managed to get a few laughs out of me. Other than that, I wish I hadn't spent my hard earned money on this movie !@Kunal "movie of the year"? Wow...oh well to each his own. Bholi Punjaban is one of those characters who could get on your nerves, if you are already annoyed with the film when she is introduced. She has the power to get to you.@Meetu : Congrats...you're the minority once again!! :P This one's getting immense appreciation and praise among the multiplex audiences in particular. Although Jolly LLB continues to be the movie of the year for me as of now.@Anuj naah, there are enough nay-sayers for this one.There will always be a "few" nay sayers,be it Munnabhai,RDB or even Sholay for that matter.Its the "majority" that matters when it comes to box office verdicts :PP.S : I myself am a nay sayer and a huge critic of DDLJ and HAHK  :D@Anuj well, if the only thing we are talking about here is box office, I don't really concern myself with that. The box office will sing its own tune, doesn't mean I have to agree with it. :DThank to share movie information i din't watch movie but some guys told me movie is good not bad so watch this weekendMeetu,I wish I had read your review before getting the DVD. Nothing seems to work in this try-hard insipid film. I had to fast forward repeatedly to reach the end, just because a friend had praised it highly.The only silver lining was Richha Chaddha.@Moviemagik did you end up watching it then?@Samir Oh well...next time ;)I have been skipping my 12 free showcase movies offered free with a Megapack subscription from last 2 years. This year my better half made me sit and utilise that over this one and boy I wasn't disappointed.As meetu said in her review the movie starts slowly in the first half but as soon as the Bholi Punjabi (Richa Chaddha) character is introduced the movie just picks up and turns into a laughing riot. The movie is best enjoyed in the comfort of your room with friends/spouse sitting beside you. Definitely a worth watch.@Nishant some times, some films are best watched in at your pace, in the comfort of your home.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
