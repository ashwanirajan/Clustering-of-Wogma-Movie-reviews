
wogma rating: Watch if you have nothing better to do (?)
Break ke baad has Deepika Padukone and Imran Khan go all wordy and repetitive on us. You've seen the promos, you've seen the film. The few insights either get lost in the rambling or become redundant with every recurrence. Just like real life. But, of course, the film is far, far from it. So, watch if you've nothing better to do, haven't fought with the partner in a while and are missing the banter.The question is no longer, "how many love stories can you watch?" It is now, "how many love stories with break-ups and the inevitable patch-ups can you watch?" And at this rate, it might as well be, "how many love stories starring Deepika Padukone having break-ups can you watch?"
Director, Danish Aslam promises that we will find parts of ourselves in the lead pair. If even half the things he says about the lead pairs relationship really comes out in the film, I'm likely to enjoy the film -
This is not a love story. It’s a story about how to make love work. It’s a story about the many many facets of love that we experience every day of our modern, sped-up, sanitized lives: falling in it, falling out of it, taking it for granted, not realizing that it’s dying a slow claustrophobic death, fighting for it with every last reserve of strength & shred of dignity, rescuing it from the worst possible whimsies of fate & character and emerging triumphant, bloody, battered & glowing from the sheer ecstasy of it all. 
Earlier in the same piece, he mentions that he sees a little of him in both the Abhay (Imran Khan) and Aalia's (Deepika Padukone) characters. That struck me as odd, as in a film acknowledging that each one of us has a bit of both feminity and masculinity, our gender usually determines which traits dominate. Not too many films make such comments especially in context of a man-woman relationship. A look at the promo below takes it a step further. Very few men behave the way Abhay behaves here. 


The role reversal of the stereotype continues -


Looking at all these trailers is surely getting me excited. And I always look forward to see Sharmila Tagore on screen. She has such a warm presence. I only hope they haven't exhausted all the fresh lines in the promos. 
Meanwhile, I've been listening to the music as I write this article and have enjoyed every song. Here are the regular reviews - 
milliblog - "It’s a delightful feeling to see Vishal Shekhar deliver great music so consistently!"
dunkdaft - "a nice little soundtrack that shines with awesome lyrics by Prasoon Joshi "
music aloud - "8.5/10"
apun ka choice - "Light rock music of the 80s has clearly influenced the album as most of the songs are not too hard on ears; they are rather soft and fresh in approach."
Bollyspice - "2.5/5"
Bollywood Hungama - "3.5/5"
Rediff - "The man's flair for juggling with words and imagery is at its optimum in Dhoop ke makaan, easily the best of the lot."

  Break Ke Baad the is title inviting. For reviewers to poke fun at. But we shall refrain. Make that try to refrain. Neither before interval not after is there a high point in the film. The conflict comes in the promos and stays there until the zzzzz climax. Like Abhay (Imran Khan) and Aaliya's (Deepika Padukone) on and off relationship, moments come and go. But nothing lingers, except for a looming sense of boredom.

With focus on just two characters, you'd hope, the film would take us to a level that we know exactly how they are going to behave. The problem though is that we know our writers much better. We know, they like Abhay, will never take risks. Actually, half-way through the film, you know there's only disappointment written for you in the end. If everyone lives happily ever after, you are going to yawn. If they choose otherwise, you are going to be ridiculing the pointlessness of the film. 
The writers brought a no-win situation upon themselves. Way too many times a beautiful thought is ruthlessly murdered by making it verbose. A film that aims at relating to the youngsters has to have something more interesting than their own fights, no? You understand the pain but don't get what the big deal is! 
A girl and a boy love each other. And like all girls and boys who are in love, they bicker until they get on our nerves. One is clingy, the other wants space. They are used to each other, so they ricochet between staying together and apart. Every once in a while they say something remarkably insightful about each other. Like two people who actually know each other. Our life on screen. In fact, they add a zest, they don’t take their fights too seriously. Good.
Only all this happens in the first half hour and repeats some 3-4 times till the end. Yet, you don't sense the claustrophobia both of them are going through. And ultimately, the characters behave like characters in a film and not like normal human beings. From being cool with their differences and conflict, suddenly these kids go on a break and are back or not or not. Bad. Very bad.
When a film chooses to mimic life and its relationships, you expect a certain warmth, which is completely missing. It's not that the actors are not doing a good job. Deepika Padukone's straight back has always made her not-so-human for me. But, the director chooses a lot of close-up shots for her and she uses them well too. The irritation, the confusion, the straightforwardness comes through.  Imran Khan wears a lot of make-up. He looks like a school boy. His character is a little on the feminine side. That's cool and he passes off as the guy who who's love struck too. But it's all very ordinary. They still don't make the characters believable.
Also, I'd much rather not see Sharmila Tagore and Navin Nischol, than see them in such shoddily written characters with some of the silliest lines. There are a couple of side characters who were interesting, but the writers didn’t have time from converting dialogues into long, mundane monologues, to delve into them. I appreciate the subtlety in Nadia's (Shahana Goswami) relationship with both Abhay and Aaliya but it looked like the editing took a whole lot of her out of the film.
Equally wasted is some awesome music. The songs come and go in the background without registering much visually. Only saving grace is that the picturisation don't kill the songs either, even if they don't add to them. I'm still going to buy the album. 
Actually, the title Break Ke Baad is a sham. Because no one has ventured into what a person goes through when he/she has broken up. Whether they have broken up or the other person has, it's still hurtful and that pain comes across only once or twice in the film. And, even then, it doesn't cut through you. Baah! What a romanticized world I live in. I'm expecting romantic films to touch me.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Girl (Deepika Padukone) and boy (Imran Khan)have been in love ever since they knew each other. But girl wants more in life than just love and boy is happy just with love. Girl (Deepika Padukone) and boy (Imran Khan)have been in love ever since they knew each other.

Loved the way the focus is drawn towards the names in the opening credits even while characters are being introduced.
The Sunita scene. Lovely idea.
The first catching up scene between Abhay and Aaliya.
Nadia's sarcasm.
The fact that Aaliya was always thinking about her mom.
The moment of realization by Aaliya after the graduation ceremony.

The references to other films and Shah Rukh Khan - whatever!
The Sunita scene. Lovely idea killed by keeping it that long.
Symbolic dialogue about "daag". Again might have been better if it had fewer words.
Story doesn't move an inch till the interval.
No, Abhay wasn't looking like crap when Nadia said he was. He was looking plain vanilla, alright.
How come she's driving a BMW?

In an arranged marriage, why would anyone send a photograph of their daughter fully dressed as a bride? Wouldn't that mean she was a bride once? Or did she dress up as a bride for the photograph.
A super boring, obnoxiously self appreciating,  pits of a decrepit script that tells about people who drive Beetles and use Zen mobiles, of guys who kick their dad’s burgeoning cinema hall business  to start a roadside kiosk in racially tense Australia, and of course, of a woman whose dumb, selfish behavior is such an exaggeration that you would just want to give her a kick in the shins to sort her out. But wait, we are the well heeled people no? We cannot have problems!Poor Imran Khan, he is only getting same type of movies again and again..his chocolaty face does the trick always.I do not know..it is good or bad.The film is just a time pass and an average film.I would NOT say "must watch".Watch it if you have nothing better to do.A movie made with a queer perspective.For all Hindi/Tamil/Telugu Songs LyricsVisit: http://www.lyricswale.comFor all Tamil Songs LyricsVisit: http://www.tamillyrics.co.inFor all Hindi Songs LyricsVisit: http://www.hindilyrics4u.co.inFor all Telugu Songs LyricsVisit: http://www.telugulyrics.co.inCopyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.

Parental Guidance:


Violence: None.
Language: A few curses and one crass character who talks either in sexual innuendoes or is directly sexual. Let's say that is about 10-15 lines in the film
Nudity & Sexual content: Casual shorts and skirts. And a couple of scenes implying there was "sleeping around"
Concept: That of finding oneself and setting priorities
General Look and Feel: Bright and peppy
