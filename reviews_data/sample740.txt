
wogma rating: Watch if you have nothing better to do (?)
Seasons change faster than some of the scenes in Mausam. Seriously. And it takes all of two hours and f-o-r-t-y long minutes for boy to meet girl, about four times after which I lost count. 
Mausam is beautifully shot, no doubt about that, but a regular love story takes forever to finish, and then there's some more left. And nope, after the first half of the first half is over, there is nothing at all that could make the lovers' frustrating journey engaging.

Mausam is beautifully shot, no doubt about that, but a regular love story takes forever to finish, and then there's some more left. And nope, after the first half of the first half is over, there is nothing at all that could make the lovers' frustrating journey engaging.When I first heard that Pankaj Kapur is directing a film, I had this imagery of a grim and gritty film. And when I saw the first look of the film, I didn't know what to make of it because it was as romantic a picture as it could get. The trailer puts all doubts to rest, if there were any left after seeing the poster. 

My heart sank as I saw Shahid Kapoor do a 'nagada nagada' (Jab We Met) in this song. No, not because he wasn't doing it well, but because I am expecting something unusual,  something not-seen-before from Mausam. 
I know not, where these expectations come from. Maybe they are just because I believe Pankaj Kapur is an exceptional actor and if he is trying something new, there is hope that it will be good. It could have something to do with the fact that he is a veteran. I mean, wouldn't we all be excited if Kay Kay Menon ventured into direction? 
One good thing that has come out of the trailer is that it has reset the expectations. Also, another thing I liked about the trailer above is that it reminded me a lot of Parineeta. Yes, the train shot that the trailer opens with adds to to that feel. 
And yet, none of the good things bring back the original excitement that I had to see a Pankaj Kapur film. I know it's unfair, but at least now there won't be extra expectations for him to satisfy. 
What about you? Did you feel let down by the promos of Mausam too?

  Mausam is like a pleasant evening breeze - you enjoy it for a bit and then fall asleep. Which is extremely sad, because you see the labour of love in each frame. It's pretty in every corner. But, the love story unfortunately goes on and on like a battery in its advert. Fine, I didn’t fall asleep but that's because I don't believe in sleeping in films, especially the ones I'm reviewing. But, I could completely imagine someone dozing off for a bit, and guess what they wouldn't have missed much when they woke up. 





(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});


Ironically, the eased-out pace Mausam starts with, is the only bit that's charming about the story. It's so pretty, so serene, so simple that high expectations are set for the drama to unfold. I enjoyed the leisurely life of a village with its cute sense of humor. But maybe, like life in the village, the story doesn't move. The characters move on, their problems and state of mind remain the same. Which is fine, that's what happens when we are in love. But, I'd enjoy my love story, I lose connection with the love between Harry (Shahid Kapoor) and Aayat (Sonam Kapoor). And there are enough, "aawwww, so sweet" moments in the first half hour. 
I also admired how the "sarson de khet" (mustard farms) I've been fed for over 15 years, felt fresh in the way they have been captured. The straight lines that railway tracks and electrical poles formed; the curves that bumpy paths and underground water pipes lying around the said "sarso de khet" formed - all very painstakingly framed. In fact, except for a tacky video-game-ish air-attack sequence, Mausam is beautifully shot. 
But, the sweetness of a relationship and the cinematography of a film can take it only so far. Of course, there is value to getting exasperated along with the characters' frustrations. But, not if it translates to irritation with the film itself. Not if, in a love story, you are forced to say, "true love and all is ok, make them meet and get done with it already!" 
And it's not like the writers haven't put in distractions along the way. There are enough of them. And I'm not talking about just the energetic songs which make you feel like you can watch Shahid Kapoor dance forever. There is historical and political context within which our lead pair struggles. Politics that you and I have witnessed. Times that we have horrific memories of. We should've gotten involved, we should've rooted for the lead pair. We don't. 
This is despite the fact that you see at least one of the two beautiful people in each frame of the screen. I didn't quite get why Harry went so rigid. I was almost going to blame Shahid Kapoor for not being able to carry off the "serious" facet of Harry, but soon realized that Harry had lost all his charm and vigor. Sonam Kapoor on the other hand maintains a status quo throughout the film. In fact, her expressions are a carry forward from her debut film, Saawariya.
A love story between a Hindu boy and a Muslim girl minus the parents who usually raise hell. The lovers' bad luck keeps getting worse and the hatred around them won't let them be together. Hatred that isn't even directly linked to their lives. The tragedy is rather poetic, in that, the two who want to live in a time and space oblivion are separated by geography and a timeline. But poetry can be boring.

          Mausam Review by me- 2 star

          Jus watched #mausam was ok but too long

          #mausam I give it 3/5 - a good movie - cud've done with crisper editing. Hang on for the review!
        
Balreet_Mandair:
          My take on "Mausam" 1st half loved it! So authentically  Punjabi! So witty and funny. 2nd half meh, too long and some things did not add up.
        
anotherkate:
          MAUSAM is a decent, if silly, romantic melodrama and contains many many shots of Shahid Kapoor striding in slow-motion in a flight suit.
        
anjan_sengupta:
          watched 'Mausam'. this movie is too lengthy, some parts are really boring and the ending has no meaning. though I liked the story line.

Phenommenon:
          can't get over the trauma that'Mausam' was made by #PankajKapoor.a love story(I think) which only made me cry cause it stretched on forever.
        
orangejammies:
          It's interesting how neither protagonist in #Mausam displays much post-traumatic stress. I suppose they left that to the audience.

          Mausam was boring. The pace of the movie sluggish and slow. The script was confused. It had no clue where it was headed (cc @krishorey)

enayatgalsulkar:

          Just like great footballers don't necessarily succeed in coaching, great actors don't necessarily succeed in directing #Mausam

shahid & sonam (stinkys).
        
akkiman:
          "Mausam ha chitrapat ajibat awesome naahiye"
Overheard on radio. That pretty much sums up the movie.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Harry (Shahid Kapoor) and Aayat (Sonam Kapoor) fall in love with each other. But destiny, as usual, has other plans for them before it decides whether they can be together.Harry (Shahid Kapoor) and Aayat (Sonam Kapoor) fall in love with each other. But destiny, as usual, has other plans for them before it decides whether they can be together.
The mute romance between Harry and Aayat in the first hour or so of the film. Many sweet moments.
Rajjo's character.
Hindi as the binding language between Punjabi and Urdu.
The rain scene in December 1997, a bit too filmy, but beautifully composed.

The talk between friends while they are sitting in a pipe - it sounded as if they were meeting after a long time when they were obviously spending a lot of time together.
Sonam Kapoor looked like she was cat-walking in a scene or two when she's walking in the farms.
Rains in Punjab in December? Just asking.
The romance between Harry and Aayat after their first separation. They went overboard with the simplicity, the silences and the general old-school-ishness. 
The mistaken identity scene with Anupam Kher.
I couldn't stop laughing when the super-imposes that mentioned the place and time of a particular section of the film started getting more and more generic. From specific months and years, villages it became India, a few years later. As if the filmmakers got tired of it all themselves.
The song in the end credits! Gave an exasperated, "isn't it over yet?" feeling.
@Anand I'm not saying I want to watch a grim film, I just felt Pankaj Kapur would make a grim feeling, just the setting in my head. for the rest, I hope so too!@Rachit Apologies. Completely missed that one. I'm going to change that to Kay Kay Menon. Thanks for pointing out the mistake.Also, interesting...Aradhana + Veer Zara + Parineeta. Also means, we get a feel its not original. Let's hope we are wrong, no?@Rohit i'll still hold on till i see the movie, who knows, it might have something different after all. Trishna - Nicely shot, etc but i feel like I know the story already. Only name that makes it interesting is Michael Winterbottom.:( I so want to watch this movie, I love Pankaj Kapoor and he is the reason why I will go!@chintan I know exactly what you mean! :( :(@Anand Good luck! and let us know what you thought.@Rajan Haanji pehchana! :D next time you are in India, party!@Kapil I know...sorry... :PI'm just coming back after seeing the movie. I found it should have been trimmed. Quite a few scenes and probably few characters were unnecessary. The romantic scenes between the leads were also slow but honest - I liked that. It was an okay movie to watch but I expected more from Pankaj Kapoor.@Simy we are movie-soul sisters, looks like.@Anand only a lesson for next time. :P ;)Mausam was an awesome movie of Shahid Kapoor. I like him so much and you reviewed Mausam very beautifully. I like your wordsMausam was an awesome movie of Shahid Kapoor. I like him so much and you reviewed Mausam very beautifully. I like your wordsThis movie is very nice and romanticWow, beautiful and romantic movie of Shahid Kapoor.
