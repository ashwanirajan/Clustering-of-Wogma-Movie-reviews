Action choreographers do their job best. The rest couldn't be bothered. Rocky Handsome's trailer opens with a romantic track and it plays long enough for you to wonder if Rocky Handsome is only about John Abraham being handsome. As the track switches, you see the romance fade away into gloom and you wonder if it is yet another revenge saga. And then, everything you have seen so far seems to have no bearing to what you are currently watching. Thankfully, this last bit is the longest and most interesting part of the trailer and makes me look forward to the film. The action to go along with it is stylish, gruesome and leaves a mark. Add to that, the name of a director who has a decent record with thrillers and you wish to forget the apprehension that the first half of the trailer brought. Maybe it was just a tool to get the viewer watching. But then again, what does it say about the film, if they have to use tools for engagement tactics, play games with the audience?Music Reviews:

  Even if it mostly involved thorough research and referencing to put together a bunch of choreographed action sequences, it is a job well done. It is brutal, it is gruesome and it is well-edited. That is about the only good thing you can say about Rocky Handsome. Other than it attempts a sensitive track without engaging emotionally even for a bit; and tries its hand at thrilling with little to surprise you. The big reveal is no reveal because you are expecting it and because it is unfolded rather mechanically. The issues addressed are way too many from drug-trafficking to human-trafficking to organ-trafficking. If the idea was to just display the brutality of the said “businesses”, it came through alright. However, none of it is not new. Except for the numbers maybe. It was cute the way the writers introduced the statistics involved in the movie instead of having them run as end credits. Yes, this is trying to grasp any visible straw. The performances are wooden, this despite cute Baby Diya Chalwad. John Abraham broods and manages a smile here or there. The villains instill fear but it is more because of the way in which they operate rather than their performances. Those seem more comic than villainous. Shruti Haasan's special appearance seems to exist only to add some oomph to a story that didn't have it. It is another matter that the story didn't need it either. This is where the film suffers further. Use of slow-motion under the garb of “stylization” is bad enough, it is used rather randomly too. Same goes for the background music. It takes special effort to ignore the music so that you can somehow stay connected to the story and what's on the screen. The story itself is all over the place in terms of the issues it wishes to take on. The cartels have a familiar hierarchy and the changes within are predictable too. The caricatures trotting around as menacing villains because of their quirks get annoying really soon. Rocky Handsome came out as rather poorly written than anything else. Maybe, we could have excused the lapses in execution and narrative had it been for a gripping story or even if it had somewhat interesting characters. Pure action it wanted to show you and that it does well.
