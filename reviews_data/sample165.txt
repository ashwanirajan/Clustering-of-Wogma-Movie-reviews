Lots of style. Not substance-less but you can tell that wasn't the focus.Main aur Charles' trailer is intriguing, the cast oozes oomph, the style is unmissable. Would it translate to a film that keeps interest? Will it end up glamorizing an unapologetic criminal? These contradicting thoughts itself make me look forward to the film. Grey characters entice and style bring you back to reality. Other than these thoughts though, there is nothing much the trailer gives away. “Wait and watch” in the true sense this one is.

  Main Aur Charles is stylish. Charles is suave. He is also supposedly a charming seducer – so you are told, not shown. The film builds an air about the character Charles Sobhraj (Randeep Hooda), but leaves it at that and doesn't get into the details. His overwhelming effect is shown, but the cause is to be assumed. For example, a criminal psychologist interviews Charles Sobhraj and she comes out rather impressed. How did he do it? Well, this movie won't tell you. The only vague attempt is made through Meera (Richa Chadda) when she talks about how she feels about him. However, she backs out and steps in too haphazardly to make sense. The performances though are the kind that keep you with the film. You want to smack the smirk off Randeep Hooda's face and that is his achievement. However, Richa Chadda isn't too convincing as Charles' dreamy-eyed lover. Adil Hussain though brings balance to the lop-sided view of Charles Sobhraj. He firmly represents a voice from the audience that says, “why is this murderer being romanticized?”The entire film is made to give that aura to the character, begging you to be seduced by him, by overcome by his slithery charm. The sepia tone, the accent, the Bond/Don-esque theme music all work towards that. There were a few distractions in terms of authenticity of the era – for example, a scene from the 80s is interspersed with a shot of a newspaper dated 1965. The clothes in Goa, especially those being sold by street vendors, looked very similar to the ones I saw in my recent trip to Goa. But hey, for all I know, fashion might have has done a full circle. All of which would have been totally ignored, were I engrossed in the story being told. They are stylish snippets that have little detail in the telling. Yet again, we have a film based on a real life personality that doesn't tell us much more about the personality than what we new from newspapers or a quick Internet search.

        ...The film, written and directed by Prawaal Raman, is classy and not show offy. It keeps its attention on the polite inmate accused of several murders. Hooda’s Charles, like the real one, maintains and conveys a grandeur by talking of books, of wanting to belong to a woman, a country, of books and philosophers, even when his hands are chained and he is talking from across a wire mesh. But it also catches him in the solitude of his cell, and with his accomplices — moments when he shows his commitment to meticulously controlling the story and images that get played in the media.

is a downer, too long..and just plays on one part of his life....and just drags on till the end to kick off..not much.

          "Main Aur Charles" is a disappointment for a film based on a very complex and enigmatic personality. Too much... https://t.co/yxAzfEO4ih

          Watched Main Aur Charles. Terrible direction/screenplay/editing and general homework wrt what the 80s looked like.

            So-So,
            by Mohit Chauhan
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.I'm little surprised to see no mention of the soundtrack in the preview. I felt it was 'different' and interesting. Particularly 'neeli bullet' and  'main yehin hoon'.I rarely listen to the music before the release of the film. I prefer to experience it with the film. There was only one music review available when I wrote the preview :)So it can be a good one time watch!@richa Yeah, I guess you could say a "one time watch".The movie is not as good as part 1. The dance lover are going to love this dance sequence but unfortunately it lacks drama and story.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
