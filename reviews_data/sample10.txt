An underwhelming fairy tale in characterization, narration and presentation. Not Bhansali’s visual best either. Yet, Padmaavat keeps you interested in Padmavati through 165 minutes, just not as interested as Khilji is in her. Spent hard-earned ₹709 for one ticket of the preview show. Not worried if it’s money well-spent because I’ve promised myself that whether or not I like it, I’ll watch it 2 more times in theater. You know, just because.There is really nothing more to say except I am really hoping that I like the film ;).

  You support it. You want it to do well just because. You even walk in with a strong hope to like it. It will still need more than grit and valour to make a film seem like it’s well-made, especially when it is over 2.5 hours. That aside, it is equally heartbreaking as it is infuriating that such furor has been allowed over a fairy tale. Fictional as the historic character, Padmavati might or might not be, queens and princesses have never been glorified so, even in fairy tales. This woman plays nurse, is witty, strategizes war and political moves, hunts deer, plays nurse, sews clothes, is a dedicated wife and dances with elegance and grace wearing a 50 kilogram ghaghra (gorgeous skirt). Okay fine, I am exaggerating, but it still weighs heavy enough for a leading newspaper to cover it – 30 kilograms. Only in a fairy tale can valiant kings and barbaric ones, both be romantics at heart who are adept at flirting and romancing. Only in a fairy tale can a warrior king who wants to rule the world be swayed not by beauty, but by the mere description of beauty. That too when the description isn’t even particularly poetic. Sanjay Leela Bhansali is to be blamed here for he is the one guilty of making macho men and empowered women into blinded lovers. It’s not that it can’t be true, but it is getting repetitive across films and you feel a ‘been there, seen that’ feel. This déjà vu cuts across from characters and situations to the sets and the costumes – which would have been fine for I could spend another two hours looking at films that look like Bajirao Mastani and Ram-Leela. Except that Padmaavat is a tad underwhelming in those two departments that you watch a Bhansali film for. While it is not his finest work visually, every frame is still picture-perfect. That’s how good his other work is. Unfortunately, the music is not even a patch on his regular fare. The dances too are visually less mesmerizing to the ones in his earlier films. Yet, they are interestingly choreographed. And this might not necessarily be a good thing. ‘bint-e-dil’ came out of nowhere and was mildly amusing and Khalibali’ madcap steps made me worry for the 100 dancers’ knees. And that I worry for knees and general well-being of performers certainly means I am distracted from the story. The one-line plot is as ‘good versus evil’ as it gets. It is an absolute one-sided view. Not that I wanted to see a dietified version of the Khiljis, but there surely must have been aspects of the Rajput royalty that failed. Or maybe the subtle hints that pointed to their failings is all we can get for now – hints at how totally incapable Rajput men were at strategizing or how a Rajput king can completely ignore a first wife after the second one enters the scene or how Rajputs allowed child brides and pregnant women to be led to their deaths under the veil of honour. In that sense, Padmaavat is a story we have never seen on screen before. However, these subtleties, if at all intentional, are few and far between. The writing otherwise holds no emotional connect – not even that occasional moment of warmth or terror that you can expect from a Bhansali product. As far as characterizations go, I take film characters at face value. I do not expect them to be what I think they should be nor do I have an image of an ideal villain or hero or side hero. I try my best to not ascribe externalities like religious intent to them. In that sense, I did not have issues with the one-sided portrayal of Ratan Singh or Alaudin Khilji or Padmavati or Nagmati. There could be a story when one man is an epitome of the values he represents – good or bad. I don’t suspect manipulation of religious sentiments or pandering in any of that. For me the basic problem is that they are black and white – literally, attire-wise; figuratively, as per the principles they stand by; behaviourally, according to the actions they take. Because this is what makes the story predictable and boring after the initial exposition.In such a scenario, we could say that each actor tried their best and yet was lacking. The pick of the lot is of course, Ranveer Singh. Some of Khilji’s mannerisms feel so much like Ranveer Singh’s offline persona and yet you don’t really think of Khilji as Ranveer Singh. You realise it as an afterthought when you are thinking about the performance. In comparison, it looks like Deepika Padukone and Shahid Kapoor muster what they can weighed down by all the costume paraphernelia. Deepika Padukone gives her sincerest best while trying to be inspirational. But often she is caught staring into the distance – which is what Shahid Kapoor does through and through except for that one time he delivers a line just like his father, Pankaj Kapoor. That ‘staring into the distance’ connection is just about the chemistry that the lead couple has. Their love for each other seems forced or at least, it pales in comparison with that between Jim Sarbh and Ranveer Singh or can be considered even less than the love-and-hate relationship between Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh – who don’t even share a single frame. In any case, the performances aren’t engaging enough to keep you from wondering about how tired the actors must be from wearing and taking off all that magnificent make-up, jewelry, and costumes.You have ample time to wonder how much budget would it take for a Hindi film to get special effects close to those from Hollywood – at least to the level that actors don’t look like wax models of themselves. You have enough room to observe Ranveer Singh’s carefully designed boorish look. And that you observe all of this instead of being engaged in the narration or being taken over by the visuals, is a let down.   As far as the depiction of history or portrayal of feminism goes it is a tight-rope act.  While Padmaavat portrays unacceptable acts as bravery and there is also merit in portraying that those acts were indeed considered brave in that time and age. After all, the film is declared as a portrayal of a queen as she was presented in a poem. The poet thought of her actions as brave, exemplary and something that should inspire her entire clan and make them proud. In that sense, the film is consistent in that those were also times when it is claimed people stuck to their principles come what may. Therefore, what to us seems like naivete and stupidity was virtue then.This trail of thought along with the constant zoning in and out from questions about costumes, budgets and computer graphics keep you from enjoying Padmaavat. Fortunately or unfortunately, they are all an intrinsic part of the lackluster story.

This is probably the first instance of a royal’s same-sex love since Razia Sultan, and this relationship is the film’s most interesting. Malik Kafur gets the best introduction scene, hinting at his androgyny — he’s presented like a slave girl, in a veil, and the next minute, he turns into a cold-blooded killer. He’s the film’s only truly Bhansali-esque character, filled with unrequited love, his smile fading every time his master speaks of Padmavati. Bhansali should have made that movie, and the Karni Sena wouldn’t have bothered at all...

But contrary to Bhansali’s artistically cloaked objective it’s the portrayal of Khilji that receives the most whistles and praise. And rightfully so because Ranveer is electric in his assumption of an oppressor, a sort of antiquated Khalnayak, who prized his so called Naayaab cheezen (so called priceless possessions) above human life....

The climax in which a pregnant woman with a young child walks towards committing Jauhar (self-immolation) to ward off capture from Khilji and his troop was a new low. While suspending belief and surrendering to a period epic unconditionally is a pre-requisite to enjoy a lavish costume drama, the last scenes in which the spirited Padukone gears up for suicide in a poetic manner comes across as unbecoming. The battle scenes are long, so take a plunge into Padmaavat if you are the mood for a grand spectacle that celebrates love,  honour, life and death on a strictly superficial level. ...

At two hours and 43 minutes, the film feels long. I can think of two songs featuring Singh that could have been discarded. Another pitfall is that Bhansali doesn't go beyond his template, this time too. He resorts to the usual tropes, like a victory dance number — in this case Khalbali, while his last release 'Bajirao Mastani' had Malhari. The story has too many loose ends. But its biggest shortcoming probably lies in the fact that the film fails to connect on an emotional level. The final scene where Padukone explains why she commits Jauhar might not connect with the audience of today....

I was really expecting thing film to be good, because of the huge budget, a good star cast, and a genius Director but it's a Magnum Disappointment....

        ...Padmaavat feels like Bhansali’s attempt to carve out some of that Baahubali territory for himself. This includes the decision to make the film in 3D, a first for the director. Bhansali is a remarkable visual stylist, but the detailing that he normally brings to sets and costumes seems to get lost here. The images in the foreground are a lot sharper—a waste of screen space, considering this is a director who packs every inch of his frames with purpose. Some of the scenes are actively worse for being in 3D; during a battle sequence, flaming arrows are beautifully framed against a dark sky, but the sensation of them flying into your glasses a second later ruins the effect....

        ...Still, there are some lovely touches in Padmaavat. The fluttering fabric of the palanquin the queen is carried in when her king brings her home, the way the villain's shoulderplates bounce as he runs with feverish urgency, the sight of an imposing crown being used to weigh down and blind a fragile princess. There are even hints at Khilji being bisexual, limited to verbal digs in what is otherwise a highly visual film. These deft asides are tragically dwarfed by the rest of this exhausting and bombastic affair, where captive princesses are made to stand in wading pools while being pelted by pearls....

        ...In Padmaavat, however, neither does he manage to hit the right notes when it comes to the soundtrack nor is there a single sequence which lingers on. No character reaches out; no moment is able to move you. Padmaavat may well be Bhansali’s most sterile and insipid outing since Saawariya and Guzaarish. It manages to wear down and exhaust rather than engage.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.The selective portrayal of history by those who haven’t read anything properly is a grave threat to the historical legacy of the country.I am a big fan of Sanjay Leela Bhansali brand of films.  At the same time I know how much of a bloated self esteem Mr. Bhansali has of himself.  He loves to pretend that a lot of research, hardwork and dedication has been poured into for each minutest object or frame portrayed.  Important word in the previous sentence being "pretend".  There is zero research, and the moment he is challenged he hides behind the pretext that the film is entirely based on a book, so if the book is right then the story is right and if the book is fiction then the story is fiction.  Which makes him a highly irresponsible director, in the category of Bhardwaj and Kashyap.  So coming to the opening sentence, pretending and twisting history is by no terms a creative liberty.  It is blatant lying and even a criminal disservice to the people of the country.Coming to the bullshit of freedom of expression.  As per the constitution of India, freedom of expression cannot be granted at the expense of hurting a community's sentiments.  This is written in black and white, and is non negotiable.  And forget freedom of expression in a bigger world, there ain't no freedom of expression on this board where an Anuj with keen interest in films and film based economics is blocked for hurting somebody's feelings.  All that is fine, but when it comes to Hindu bashing and Hindu culture bashing, suddenly freedom of expression becomes of paramount importance.In the late 1980s a mediocre book by the name of Satanic verses hit the headlines.  The book was banned in India by Congress party as it hurt the sentiments of the Indian Muslims.  I chose to respect the feelings of the Indian Muslims and did not read the mediocre book.  Now a mediocre film comes along that hurts the sentiments of the proud Rajput community.  I will choose to respect the feelings of the proud Rajput community and not watch the mediocre film.To each his own. I pick not being offended as a cause because it allows me to be exposed to different opinions.Freedom of speech includes right to offend, whether the offended party is a Hindu, a Muslim or an Ambani@Andy and I guess right to be offended too :/Don't really understand the reason for fuss around. Its a nice movie but I didn't like the songs.Constitution of India is very clear.  Freedom of expression doesn't give the freedom to defame any community.  We are talking of Indian laws.  If you have any doubts then read up the constitution.@Meeta: you choose not to be offended?  Seems nice intellectually heavy progressive statement.  Why doesn't it match up with your past statements on films like Masti series, or on bloggers like Anuj - a few examples where it offends your sensibilities.  Suffering from selective choosing, like the intelligentsia?  When it is Hindu bashing, I believe in freedom of choice.  Otherwise, no derogatory, inflammatory, insulting, allowed?The good quality of a person can be assessed if his/her behaviour remains identical in every situation dealing with the subject, and not when it changes based on religious/political/national affiliations.I have no issues neither with the fact that not everyone is offended by the same matters.  What is pitiable is that such so called progressive people are unable to accept that the sensibilities of a large number is affected and so let's show some empathy towards them.  That's where such pseudos get fully exposed, and that's how they are labelled pseudo as they are unreal.@FANYou're implying "Practice what you preach" here, correct? Sounds ideal, but often does it match up with the behaviour of the likes of people like me in the real world? I have no issues with those in favor of it or against it as long as they don't resort to violence. Not flattering, but your writing skills are excellent.If I misunderstood, simply forget it!! Given my French, that's only understandable. P.S. Hi meetu!@Fan Are you taking about the same movie I saw? Because all Padmaavat does is glorify Rajputs and their valor, scene after scene. If one was a Khilji admirer, I can still understand the anger. This movie was like a grand tribute to Rajputs.@Fan I knew there was a chance you would bring up the Masti series! I don't have an objection to people making those films. If that is what they want to do with their time, money, energy, and talent, so be it. I just can't make myself watch them. I didn't even say, readers shouldn't watch it. I just informed readers that I cannot make myself watch it. Am I offended? Not really, it is just not my taste. Would I like less of such films? Yes, of course. And actually, in my comment I only expressed my opinion on "taking offense", like you expressed yours. As far as Anuj's comments being monitored goes, I don't like personal attacks on other people (readers or filmmakers) on my website. That is it. Am I offended by it? Nope, life is too short to get offended by such things. Do I want less of it on my site? Yes, of course and I shall do what it takes.Having said all of that, I am sure there are things out there that I am offended by - cockroaches might fit the bill. And yet, whenever I see myself being offended I work on managing my intolerance - you'll be surprised, I tried it for cockroaches too. Unsuccessfully, though. Will keep working on it. Will I ask people who don't mind cockroaches to take an offense, naah. Their wish.@LostInConfusion Hello-hello! Welcome back.@Mohit That aside, all people should do is not watch it themselves, if they don't like the idea.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
