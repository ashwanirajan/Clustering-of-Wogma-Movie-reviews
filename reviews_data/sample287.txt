An engaging conman story that loses steam a little too often.As soon as I hear of a smart conman with a mentor, I think of Bluffmaster and Khosla Ka Ghosla. Raja Natwarlal seems to be a combination of both. While the film seems to be in good hands as far as the actors are concerned, the same can't be said about the director, Kunal Deshmukh. His earlier outings aren't really inspiring. Although, this time we have a different producer.On the other hand, the combination of Kay Kay Menon, Paresh Rawal and Emraan Hashmi is inspiring enough. Other than that though, there is nothing in the trailer in terms of dialogue or plot that stands out. The treatment seems to have an element of style that could go either way for the film. While comparisons with other conman films might be easier to handle, a thriller of this sort banks heavily on the twists and I hope those will keep us glued. There's no telling how that one will go. Meanwhile, the music doesn't seem to be too impressive. Music Reviews:
Bollyspice - "1.5/5" 
Bollywood Hungama - "2.5/5" 
glamsham - "3/5" 
koimoi - "3/5"  
Milliblog - "an oddly mild Hindi debut!" 
Music Aloud - "6.5/10"

  Raja Natwarlal has a few very interesting twists and a few edge-of-the-seat moments. But the fact that the person in the soup gets out way too easily, the person who is supposed to be duped is conned too easily and the utlimate climax is a little too simplistic - all take away from the thrills that are set-up. It does engage only to fizzle out too soon. A prime example of this is the climax. The build-up to the climax is truly engaging. It has the appropriate twists, it has the perfect measure of the hero being caught in a tight spot, you really want to know how he is going to squeeze out of this one, but the climax itself is as lame as it gets. An anti-climax of sorts.These dips after a reasonable high comes across as lazy writing. Given that there is hardly any effort spent on according depth to the characters, and the dialogue is simple except for the lines for Paresh Rawal's character, the high in the thrilling situations is the only thing that makes the story kick. It is unfortunate, that a film with one of the best cliff-hangers I have seen at interval, isn't able to retain the interest. Emraan Hashmi and Paresh Rawal perfectly pose as the smart Alek and the experienced conman respectively. Paresh Rawal's introduction in fact is equally amusing and cool - the kind of arrogance and smart that you think is deserved. But, he doesn't get to show much of that off later in the film. Kay Kay Menon too starts out as a menacing character but later tones down. Though he makes the most of the bits given to him, as we are used to expecting now. Humaima Malick brings nothing to the table in terms of her performance. In fact, Deepak Tijori with his short, restrained yet comfortable appearance leaves a longer impression. The main problem with Raja Natwarlal is it is different from the conman films we are used to. Yes, and unfortunately, "different" goes against the film. It takes itself too seriously. Other films of this genre like Bluffmaster or Bunty Aur Babli have a slick, sweet humor about them that doesn't allow the story to dip. Even Khosla Ka Ghosla, in fact - which also suffers from the other problem of a very smart businessman turning gullible to suit the story's requirement - has a subtle humor about it which keeps that smile intact. Even so, Raja Natwarlal can be a casual TV watch which you won't regret. Especially, since you can forward/switch channels when the run-time lengthening, otherwise irrelevant songs show up.

        ...It’s the performances where 'Raja Natwarlal' manages to score. The casting is spot on. The talented Emraan beautifully blends vengeance and vulnerability. He’s back to locking lips and packing a punch and fans will simply lap him up. Paresh as Yogi brings a certain dignity to the role of a crook in a way only he can. His is the most layered character in the film and he pulls it off with panache. Kay Kay Menon’s steely eyes and cold-blooded reserve bring to life the savage scoundrel of Varda. The only weak link is Humaima Malik who overdoes the part of a shrill, over-concerned girlfriend. The music is very average, which is not common in Kunal Deshmukh films. But given that Emraan is back as the roadside Romeo hero, and that Bollywood has well trained us to go easy on the logic bit, 'Raja Natwarlal' could just be a watchable fare....

This one is just not cool enough a con-film, after you have watched films like Special 26 in the recent past. An attempt to create a 'naya India ka naya Natwarlal' had to be smarter, else it is just demeaning the original icon!...

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.A conman wants revenge.A conman wants revenge.
The tribute to Mithilesh Kumar Srivastav. 
Music of the opening song started before the song as background music, leads up to the song nicely even if the song itself is irrelevant.

Two songs - five minutes apart within the first 15-20 minutes of the film. A huge put-off. 
The car-switch to rob the money. Why did it involve such a complicated set-up? Couldn't Raja have made his way into the trunk just like that?
Why the long scene with Deepak Tijori's wife, when she doesn't really appear for too long for the rest of the film? These dips in pace add to both the run-time and the dip in the excitement.
What was the purpose of Yogi's tests for Raja?
The vague nod to Ocean's Eleven works against the film, because it is nowhere close to Ocean's Eleven and its suave. 
The many loopholes - unfortunately, can't mention them since they give parts of the movie away.
Where did the set-up money come from? 
Why did they open the bodybag before throwing it in the water?
A body is disposed off in broad daylight?
The explanation in the end. Both the explanation itself and the way it is done. 
@Meetu i think this movie reminds me of one of the earlier movie Ek Khiladi Ek Hasina and it was a decent film.Hope I am wrong but it seems heavily inspired by that.Meetu, here's a comparison....The Sting. From the trailer you can tell this movie is a rip off of The Sting. Conman's partner dies, so he joins hands with a more experienced conman to take revenge on the guy who is responsible of his friend's death. Emraan is playing Redford's character, Paresh is playing Paul Newman's, and KK is playing Robert Shaw's. This is going to be a horrible movie.@Siddharth Haven't seen that one.@Roy J haven't seen that either :/Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
