
wogma rating: Watch if you have nothing better to do (?)
The best part of the film is its title track that recaps the previous film. Fukrey Returns had a chance to engage and entertain had it not been for its episodic, often nauseating, slapsticky humour.Choocha and Bholi Punjaban are back. They seem to carry the same quirks as the last time. So, the slightly engaging novelty will be missing this time around. The trailer doesn’t have anything to look forward to except the hope that Pankaj Tripathi might have a bigger role. That’s too little to hang on. In fact, the jokes might seem to be a tad juvenile. From the reviews, the music seems to be no great shakes. What do we hang on to? Just, crossed fingers, I guess.Fukrey Returns releases on 8 December, 2017.Music Reviews:
Bollywood Hungama – "2.5/5" 
glamsham - "3/5" 
Milliblog - "Aptly titled soundtrack that’s a far cry from Ram Sampat’s superior original."

  A story-building game kids play at parties, has one person start a story with one line. Each child has to add a line to the story in turn. The story takes direction according to the imagination of the group. It is a lot of fun and often an entertaining, engaging story comes of it. Fukrey Returns is a film made out of one such story. The overall story is interesting and amusing, but the details needed to make a kids’ party story into a film, are just not funny.So, from poison being sucked out of a snake-bitten butt to jokes about organ trafficking to laughing at someone because they are dark-skinned to objectifying women – Fukrey takes a shot at anything that might get kids at a party to laugh. This is unfortunate considering the overall plot of these four good-for-nothings finding themselves in a soup caused by an underworld don is quite refreshing, especially in the logicless slapstick genre. The back and forth, the out-smarting and the double-crossing are disconnected and episodic. Yet, they could have worked if the connecting fibre wasn’t juvenile humor.   Sure, some of the humour comes through to make you smile at the silliness of it all. But, it is out of pity – for the makers, actors and the audience.The biggest losers in this venture are the actors. For each one of them, is quite capable. That they get the timing right is of no consequence when it is an unfunny quip or scene. Their talent is exploited by making them repetitive. Also, Ali Fazal and Manjot Singh are redundant. In terms of both quantity and quality, their roles are as dispensable, as those of Vishakha Singh and Priya Anand, are gratuitous. Altogether these four characters are a little more relevant to the plot than the item number and significantly less relevant than the individual characters, ‘chungu mungu’, Richa Chadda’s henchmen, and the lioness and her cub.It is not that Fukrey Returns doesn’t evoke emotion. But, I am assuming disgust and boredom aren’t what they were going for.

This is a world of rapidfire happenings where what goes around doesn't necessarily come around....

As it stands, the humour is more sitcom like and keeps you entertained in parts without being involved. The movie just about passes muster thanks to Choocha, Bholi Punjaban and Panditji. But it’s December, and the weather is great, we are in a mood to forgive, wind down and enjoy the holiday season. If you are not very exacting about your entertainment this will work for you.

Injunctions of Choocha's clowning in such instances appear forced, and fail to inspire laughs. Unfortunately, despite their acting prowess, Vishakha Singh and Priya Anand are reduced to mere props.
