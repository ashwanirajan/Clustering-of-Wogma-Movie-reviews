With next to nothing happening in the first 70 minutes and a disgustingly horrifying last 20 minutes, Bhoot Returns pretty much yells 'don't watch me'. Even if the aim of the film is to disgust and horrify you, the approach it takes doesn't make the film any more palatable. Another comeback by a lead actress from a decade or so ago. This time it's Manisha Koirala. She picks the horror genre and we have no less than Ram Gopal Verma directing the film. Very interesting combination, I say. A mother who is afraid of her daughter because the daughter seems to be possessed. Interesting concept too. The trailer also suggest that they have avoided the usual trappings of a horror film that can break the film. It does look like a reasonably horrifying film. But, then again it is Ram Gopal Verma. Just because I am hoping against hope that he won't torment with tight close ups and pounding music, he is unlikely to keep them at bay. I am so wary of the extra dimension at his disposal. I am all game to get scared even though I don't enjoy horror, but I don't want to be annoyed by a dominant department of film-making. However, I guess, at least this once they are used in the right genre. One thing that does bother me about any horror film involving kids is the effect that might have on the child artist. Is it fair to them? Is it fair to their childhood, to have them know of concepts way beyond what is appropriate for their age? Are they at the very least protected and well taken care of psychologically during the making of the film? It is almost impossible for me to keep that nagging feeling away while judging how I liked the film.

  Just the experience of watching a film like Bhoot Returns in the theater is annoying, where the audience is so sure of having come for a comedy film masked as a horror film that it can never stop giggling. Save a few minutes in the the last quarter of the film there wasn't a minute of silence in the audience. Continious chitter-chatter and/or laughter was on because of what was happening on screen or rather because of what was NOT happening. The plot barely moved an inch in the first half. Night turned into day and day turned into night, with the nights getting longer but the material stayed pretty much the same. The attempt at replicating the Paranormal Activity effect again was superficial and quite plainly didn't work. While days passed, the dialogue was outright hilarious because it was so inane. While some of it might have been intentionally comic like say the hide-and-seek sequence, but it looked all too silly. For a change though background music, albeit loud, had been used a little differently and created a tiny bit of tension. The use of 3D on the other hand, was rather comical. It was employed either to give a wide-angle effect or to make items in the foreground obstruct the view to things/people in the background. While Manisha Koirala did a decent job of being scared, her character Namrata is disturbingly not your standard  loving mother. Even if a mother is self-centered, it is difficult to imagine her yelling at her child who is so obviously in need of help. The rest of the cast was just about okay but the dismal tele-marketing kind of dubbing for Madhu Shalini was extremely distracting. Not to mention, the only reason for her existence in the film seemed to be to add some X factor, for there's nothing she, as the possessed child's aunt did that either parent couldn't have done.Personal judgments and role definitions aside the much advertised horrifying climax was a bit too uncomfortable to digest. And maybe that was exactly the aim of the film – to make its audience uncomfortable at the very thought. Yet, it makes me sick to even think that there might be people out there who are okay with what the conclusion implies. My usual complaint about having child artists play roles of possessed humans stays though, I guess, I can be relatively relieved that it is kept down to just one sequence which was not that intense either. While one can thank Mr Verma for keeping the film short at 90 minutes, the re-return of the Bhoot seems imminent. And that, I am certainly wary of.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.this movie will SUCK!!@Lil I was hoping at least the acting will be good. Let's see...Said so@Lil :PI am a little curious, so asking :Rajeev Masand calls the film 'time-pass entertainment' (though I agree, accompanied by a 2 star rating), and yet its tagged as a 'thumbs down' wala review. Any comments?@Harsh At first read (I must admit a quick one, since there were 4 films this week), his review read it as he didn't quite like the film. Thus the thumbs down, also of course encouraged by the below 2.5 rating. 2.5 rating goes straight to so-so.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
