
wogma rating: Beg or borrow, but do watch (?)
Ferrari Ki Sawaari is worth a watch in the theaters, just for the love with which it is put together and the warmth with which you come out. Who would have thought we'd be getting a positive lesson in parenting from a Hindi film and that too at the hands of Sharman Joshi and Satyadeep Misra?Ferrari Ki Sawaari seems to be a fun film sandwiched between two political dramas, Shanghai and Gangs of Wasseypur. While, it might be a good break between two potentially heavy films, I don't think it will be a break from meaningful, good cinema. I like what the Vidhu Vinod Chopra - Rajkumar Hirani combination has produced, thus far. A lovely, flavorful mix where humor addresses a socially relevant issue.
What I loved about the trailer is that it doesn't give away much about the issue they are addressing or the medium they are going to use. In addition, it creates interest for the connection between the Ferrari and cricket, except of course Sachin Tendulkar.

Of course, it does look like it's going to be about a parent's aspiration for his child, a grandparent's skepticism and will hopefully bring about chemistry between the three generations. What with Sharman Joshi and Boman Irani playing those two roles! 
That the music and lyrics of the songs sound like it's right out of Rajkumar Hirani's stable, it’s a surprise that it is actually by Pritam Chakraborty - a sentiment that is echoed in many of the music reviews. Oh yeah, and there is Vidya Balan's item number. While the song doesn't itself look anything very different from a regular lavni, that Vidya Balan is doing it, is interesting enough. Hopefully, there is more reason for it the song to be in the film than just that. And with Rajkumar Hirani being on board, there is scope for that, a la Munnabhai MBBS' 'dekh le'.
Another film to look forward to on back-to-back Fridays!

  The brand-combination Rajkumar Hirani-Vidhu Vinod Chopra invariably brings a warm film, fairly well-made film. They make very simple use of the tools, no glitter, no glamor, no grit or grim either. Just an outlandish yet sweet story and a very strict focus on their intention, on what it is they want to convey this time. They do touch upon many side issues that come along organically, but they don't lose sight of the basic issue they take up. And like every other time they manage to make me forgive the irritants and go with the flow and enjoy their film for what it is.I'm not taking anything away from director, Rajesh Mapuskar for all the good things going for the film. Just the performances alone make him worthy of all the credit he deserves. It's just that the Hirani-VVC stamp is so resounding in the story-telling. A 12-year old, Kayo (Ritvik Sahore) is good with the cricket bat, exceptionally good. But his curse is that his dad, Rustom (Sharman Joshi) can't afford a training camp in London which Kayo so deserves to go to. Another deterrent is a disgruntled and non-supportive grandfather, Deboo (Boman Irani). And then you join in on a fun trip on how Rustom makes sure his son's aspirations are met. The means Rustom uses put the film in fantasy zone. But, the makers want exactly that - to suck you into the unbelievability of the basic plot and make you root for its characters. Characters which have been beautifully developed. So warm they are, that you let go of your need for unpredictability. Rustom is introduced to you as the ideal citizen who, given his background and the premise of the story, will have to at some point sell his soul. You know Deboo is in dire need of a cathartic moment and he'll have to find it in the next two hours or so. And yet, the how is engaging and entertaining.This brand's weakness for coming up with an over-the-top, even more unbelievable climax is well-known. And they pretty much stick to it. But hey, a few beautiful moments, some wonderful scenes between characters, a heart that's warming you from the inside as you walk out of the theater - if these are the takeaways, why not? But for a moment or two, the climax sticks to the overall tone of the story thus far. The things that happen in those couple of moments are annoying but the quibble in the head dissolves as you accept it, even if grudgingly so.The many issues the film touches upon either in passing or with a little more importance than that and the subtlety with which it's done reaches out to you. From the standard potshot at media behavior and a little more elaborate one at the bureaucracy in Indian sports and well the, law & administration to the irony of Sachin Tendulkar and his Ferrari - Ferrari Ki Sawari covers a broad spectrum.Parenting - the basic theme that it covers - is the one that attaches the film to its audience. The father-son-father relationship is handled with such brilliant charm. It is a battle of generations, it is a battle of parenting styles. The manner in which Rustom (along with Kayo's coach) handles Kayo's aspirations and behavior issues can serve as a parenting guide. In contrast, only to show a mirror to the regular, and if I may add, Indian parenting methodology you have Rustom's dad and another relationship between a politician and his son. Of utmost importance is the missing mother or in fact, any significant female character. And the one woman in a supporting role has very little feminine about her (which is also subtly alluded to in a scene where she just about passes of as a man). As a woman, I am glad Ferrari Ki Sawaari was conscious to keep the lady-factor out. Behind all the Sachin-Sachin and Ferrari-Ferrari the film harps about, is a very strong thread of the relationship of a child with his father. A role that only HE can play. That I haven't mentioned the fantastic performances so far is a testimony to how much else there is going on in the film. Boman Irani - oh what a performer! - his stagger, the lopside of his mouth, the tongue sticking out demonstrating the slug that his life has turned him into, and I can go on. Rustom's simple-mindedness wouldn't have come across if it wasn't for Sharman Joshi's demeanor. Even Seema Bhargava as the jugaadu event manager is as real as any Bombayite could get. Aakash Dhabade as Sachin Tendulkar's domestic help is a huge take away from the film. The small exchange between Paresh Rawal and Boman Irani itself is worth the ticket money for an ardent film-lover.Yes, it would have worked better if the film was shorter. Yes, a few extra characters could have been avoided to make the film crisper. But Ferrari ki Sawaari wasn't intended to be crisp, it was intended to give you that lovely feeling inside. That feeling of having giving in to the fantasy, the feeling of being inspired and involved while watching a fun film, the feeling of having watched a decent film.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Will Kayo, a brilliant 12-year old batsman be able to get into an illustrious and sought after cricket camp despite it beign out of his reach financially?Will Kayo, a brilliant 12-year old batsman be able to get into an illustrious and sought after cricket camp despite it beign out of his reach financially?The fantasy world that Rustom creates for Kayo (Ritvik Sahore) when he is upset.
The manner in which Kayo stands up for his father.
The piggy bank staring back at Rustom.
The build-up for the first match and how it ends.
'Government of India' zindabad!! How cute is that!!
Deboo's comment on the loan system.
Deboo's comment on Don Bradman.
The Rome wedding.
Deboo ragging Rustom about phone and Sachin's Ferrari - said so much about their characters.
Deboo's idea of water-proofing business being the 'big' thing in Bombay.
The concept of 'Cricket ka *rishta* (relationship)' being stronger than blood relationships.
The sound of the Ferrari engine. :)
The Ferrari's cover in its parking spot placed like it was a funeral.
The Security guard-Tendulkar's domestic helper track was very cute, though it was given a lot more space than necessary in relation to the main story.
The scene between Dharmadhikari and Deboo (Boman Irani).
The confusion in the end about the money between Deboo and Rustom (Sharman Joshi).

If Kayo's team was batting first in a match, how could they be needing X runs in so many overs? Or did Rustom take that long at the shop that it was the second inning of the match.
Reliance brand placement.
That Kayo is good at everything - he's well-behaved, a good cricketer and head of school choir.
From being so righteous Rustom does what he does.
The item number.
The politician's track was a little over-played.
Media ignores a political scandal of THAT proportion to attend to a father-son relationship? Really?
Kayo patronizing Rustom in the scene above.
The attempt at showing Sachin. Why?
Ferrari ki Sawaari is a guide for parents.

Violence: A few gun shots in the air. None.
Language: Squeaky clean.
Nudity & Sexual content: None! There are barely any women characters.
Concept: Parent-child relationship across generations and backgrounds.
General Look and Feel: Bright and peppy
Isn't para no. 3 incomplete? "And then you join in on a fun trip on how Rustom "@Priya oops! You are right, thanks for pointing it out. Fixed.Mediocre film, completely predictable and slow. First time my trust on Wogma review has shaken.oh well :( hopefully won't happen too often. No two people can have the same choice 100% of the time. My attempt is to make clear why I liked the film and hopefully the reader can see if those are the things that appeal to them. Will keep trying. :)I totally agree with the review. Its a worth watch. Very Fun and away from cheapish films of today. One can easily watch with children around as well.Thanks! That is a very comprehensive review. I espescially loved the way you have categorized at the PG section and the tabulations. It sure is a very comprehensive review..@Amol Yeah, I know. The problem is once I save it, it's not wise for the site to change it. @Sunny @Vinay Thank you, guys!movie was not that much appealing . story is good but screenplay and direction  were very poor . i dont like other actors too except sharman and boman ...and there was no relation between stealing of Ferrari and cricket.@Mahaveer Thank you so much. As far as Ferrari Ki Sawari goes I enjoyed the 'slow' pace. Also, I somehow didn't expect it to be a 'cricket' film, so was saved from being disappointed. The trailer gave me the feel it will be about relationships more than the sport.@AnandR This one is a little different from the standard VVC-Hirani product, but the value system it uses is the same. @Amruta :) ouch...i thought the connection between the Ferrari and cricket was the most hilarious one."Nudity & Sexual content: None! There are barely any women characters."Associating nudity entirely with women is male chauvinism at the least. Hope you realize that.@Divya Point taken. Guilty as charged. Will watch out next time.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com. All rights reserved.(Credits: wogma logo by Ain Digytal Inc. wogma audio review signature tune by Shreyas Beltangdy.
