All the adjectives, all the phrases, all the clichés of the not-so-kind kind that apply to a mindless comedy, apply to Hum Tum Shabana. The good news is it will be pretty easy to watch Hum Tum Shabana with a clean slate. All that I enjoyed in Bheja Fry was appropriately cancelled out by Bheja Fry 2. So, there are actually zero expectations from Sagar Ballary's Hum Tum Shabana.
The bad news is that the trailer promises more a plain-Jane slapstick film. 

Even worse, there are glimpses of Golmaal in the trailer itself. And what could have been an interesting premise, protagonist wooing a woman who belongs to an underworld clan has already been done recently in Ready and a bit in Welcome - none of which can match Mickey Blue Eyes. Ok fine, the twist seems to be that there are two protagonists instead of one, doing the wooing. 
But doesn't it seem like there are two heroes only because neither of those "actors" is known to carry a film by themselves? I agree, both, Shreyas Talpade and Tusshar Kapoor of them individually can have crackling comic timing, but the rivalry their characters seem to share in Hum Tum Shabana, will require chemistry. And no, it really doesn't look like Minissha Lamba is going to be more than an accessory to the plot. 
So, there is nothing to look forward to. On the plus side, anything we get, a smile, a grin, a LOL even will be a bonus. Let's look forward to that then.

  I'm a little under the weather. The annoying type of being unwell where you don't have fever but are feverish. While walking into Hum Tum Shabana I thought all ache-able parts of my body are already aching. Nope. Hum Tum Shabana made me realize that my ears weren't aching at the beginning.

Hum (Shreyas Talpade/Tusshar Kapoor), Tum (Tusshar Kapoor/Shreyas Talpade) and Shabana (Minissha Lamba) are all loud and are surrounded by louder people. The story goes from weird (two guys falling in love at the same time with the same woman the first time they see her on screen) to berserk (wooing her in the most ridiculous fashion) to utter rubbish (they want to get out of proposing to her because of reasons you should find out for yourself, if you are interested despite this warning). Sometime in the berserk era, there is one scene that is so ridiculous that it's funny. "How could you even come up with that?" kind of funny. 
But save that there's nothing at all in the film. Well, I guess I got that  one laugh I was looking for. 
These are times I wish I could borrow, NW1W (not worth one word) concept from milliblog. Till then, here's my attempt at keeping it short and simple - Skip!
