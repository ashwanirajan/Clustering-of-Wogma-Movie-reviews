
wogma rating: Add to 'must watch' list (?)
A decent thriller. If only there were a couple edge-on-seat plot points.I am so tempted to repeat the first paragraph of the Raees review. It truly is heartening to see actors, who we associate with a certain type of cinema, do something slightly different. Just that bit is enough for me to not complain about them not breaking the mould completely. Kaabil might not be the best thriller out there, but it surely keeps you wondering, “HowHeDunnit”. And that bit doesn't disappoint.Kaabil reminded me a lot of  Aankhen. It had to, right? And I have this strong feeling that some plot points, if not all have been inspired from elsewhere. The tone of the film from the beginning kind of gives away how things are going to go with our hero. Also, the film spends a good half of the film on the couple but doesn't leave an emotional tug. These two things put together make Kaabil a little underwhelming.Nevertheless, the curiosity about how it is done takes you through the film. Also, Hrithik Roshan  is angry and sad more than being all goody-goody. When he does the latter, it usually gets annoying in the first few minutes. This could be why Yami Gautam and he don't make your hearts go all mush despite capable execution by Yami Gautam. The aggressive bits, Hrithik Roshan does much better though and that works for Kaabil. Ronit Roy and Girish Kulkarni add to this intensity by being the bad men that they might soon be stereotyped as. The songs jar and the item number thrown in for good measure distracts from the seriousness of the film. However, Sanjay Gupta does control himself in the editing and camerawork department. There are no unnecessary quirks or choppy cuts which add to the films intensity. While the dynamics of how the thrill is brought about are written well, the  main character's transition bothered me. On the other hand, it has always bothered me when films have a common man, who is disappointed by the system, take matters into his own hands. So, that would make me reject half the films in this genre, right?In that sense then, Kaabil is a worthy watch. Despite all the ifs and buts.

        ...On the whole, KAABIL is gripping, gut-wrenching and is likely to stay with you for a long time. Now that DANGAL has almost exhausted its run at the ticket windows, the box-office is quiet and subdued and KAABIL should have no difficulty filling seats at cineplexes, despite a strong opponent releasing alongside. Rich in merits, this film has the power and potential to emerge a success story at the box-office. Highly recommended!

The film won’t bore you even for a second. ‘Kaabil’ is overwhelming, magical and a feel good film. The film is one of the most interesting revenge sagas made in the recent times.

        ...Kaabil belongs to one man and that is its leading man Hrithik Dedicated Roshan. The actor who seems to have put all his heart and soul into the making of this riveting drama is worth the price of your tickets alone. While his earnest and hard worked performance compliments the tight script of the film, the straightforward yet seemingly outdated direction of the film by Sanjay Gupta keeps you thoroughly entertained. Kaabil is for viewers who don’t mind watching entertainers. Don't be surprised if the actor walks away with all major awards of the season next year.

At a runtime of just over two hours, the Hrithik Roshan starrer strikes all chords just spot on. With a tight screenplay and tighter execution, Kaabil hardly gives you anytime to deviate from its narration. The film that begins with a goofy yet appreciable romantic plot between its lead pair Hrithik and Yami, changes momentum in its second half to become an engaging drama! Kaabil won’t disappoint you. Go for it!

: Predictable To Death
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Dont agree actually.Nothing seems exceptional. Even on paper its so predictable , i dont understand why RAkesh decided to produce it , with Hritik in lead and Sanjay Gupta s director.i was literally saying the dialogues before actors opening their mouth.[comment deleted partially because it gives the movie away]so many plot holes.A complete out & out mass entertainer with HR delivering arguably his best since Lakshya. Unfortunately its box office prospects are dented thanks to [comment deleted partially because it is not relevant to the discussion of the film] star [comment deleted partially because it is not relevant to the discussion of the film] 65% of the screens for his film. Review coming up soon.Despite lack of novelty and plenty of loopholes, Kaabil excels thanks to a flawless performance by its main lead and some slick action that we associate with all Sanjay Gupta films coupled with a typical underdog [comment partially deleted because it gives movie away] Rakesh Roshan storyline http://bollywoodreviewguide.blogspot.in/2017/01/review-2-kaabil.html@Meeta : "On the other hand, it has always bothered me when films have a common man, who is disappointed by the system, take matters into his own hands." ~why exactly would that bother someone while watching a movie? Secondly, what do you have to say about A WEDNESDAY in the same context?@Anuj because it is out of character. Someone who behaves like he would think twice before hitting a mosquito that is drinking its blood, suddenly becomes this macho man and has no qualms about mercilessly hitting/murdering people. Of course, I will never know, right? Howmuchever I try, I will never know what it is like to go through the torture that some of the protagonists have gone through to have reached the tipping point. But, just doesn't seem likely from the way the protagonist is portrayed before and after the event. That is what makes 'A Wednesday' different, right? The protagonist was what he was from the beginning AND he did not actually physically injure anyone."because it is out of character" ~pure suspension of belief. The basic difference between real life & story telling. Especially when you watch Rakesh Roshan brand of films, be it Khoon Bhari Maang, Karan Arjun, Koi Mil Gaya or Kaabil.An incredible and a must watch movie! Awesome acting by Hrithik and well directed by Sanjay Gupta.Kaabil proves yet again that after Amitabh Bachhan if there is a real actor comfortable in various kinds of roles and genre of films then that is Hrithik Roshan.  Hrithik has nailed very well the mannerisms of a blind person, the previous time that I can remember of such an effort being that of Naseeruddin Shah in Sparsh.Other than Hrithik’s sincere and top-notch performance, Kaabil is an interesting watch thanks to its novelty value on how can a visually impaired person plan and execute the perfect revenge crimes.  Had the protagonist been a person with normal fully functioning physical body then the revenge drama might not have held the interest, but here it is different.  Unconsciously we perceive being blind as a handicap, simply because for us doing things with eyes closed is difficult.  But for the handicapped person, it is no longer a handicap.  [Comment edited because it gives a part of the movie away]  Premise is nice, plot has been executed fairly well, and the interest is kept intact till the end.On the basic revenge and vigilante justice system, of course it is not to be encouraged.  On the other hand, given the often under-performing law and order system to bring justice to rape victims, such genre of films reflect the growing anger of people against this social vice.  Hrithik and Yami portray well the victimized couple, your heart bleeds for them.  Once that is achieved, the rest is easy – the audience is already craving for the blood of the perpetrators.The film although is not very crisp.  It could have been shorter (reduce the introduction, remove the regular occurrences of Hrithik’s thoughts spoken out aloud, etc.).  Also: as in real life things do not go as planned (which makes the thriller part exciting), and then it is difficult to accept the twists and opportunities that favour the blind man regularly.  It becomes too much of a “lucky” or “coincidental” break.  But thanks to the intensity of Hrithik’s act, one can sit through it and even accept it.On the main characters other than Hrithik Roshan:  Yami risks getting seriously stereotyped[Comment edited because it gives a part of the movie away] (Action Jackson, Badlapur, and now Kaabil).  Ronit Roy is brilliant, there are traces of Nana Patekar in his act (probably due to the Maharashtrian character that he plays), all other characters being just alright.Overall: watch it to get a glimpse of the range of Hrithik's ability.  And also for the novelty aspect on how a perfect crime does not require a perfect 36 quality human being.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.

Parental Guidance:


Violence: Loads and some gory too. 
Language: No abusive language
Nudity & Sexual content: Rape is talked about and even though it is not explicitly shown, there are scenes where a rape has happened
Concept: Revenge drama
General Look and Feel: Despite being a thriller, the editing is not overdone. So moves along at a decent pace.
