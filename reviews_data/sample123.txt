The despair, the hope, the frustration – you see it all, though you might not necessarily feel it.Her character cried for her daughter, this one will wail for her brother – Being sad seems to translate to good acting in Aishwarya Rai's books.  The despair in the eyes that means the character grieves beyond repair has gotten too repetitive all too quickly. Hopefully, the film will have a lot more happening other than the above to tug our hearts and keep the pull on. Randeep Hooda' performance for instance is something to look forward to even if it looks a little over the top in being hysterical. I assume for now the story requires the eccentricity. Sarbjit's trailer make you enter the cinema hall with unsure steps, a heart hoping to be moved, while the brain trying its best to keep away from disappointment. Music Reviews:
Bollyspice – "3.5/5" 
Bollywood Hungama - "3/5" 
Milliblog - "Despite the streak of sadness all through the soundtrack, there’s some good music in here!"

  Probably the worst thing that one human can do to another is give them hope and then squash it. Even worse than the uncertainty of not knowing. Physical torture breaks the body, the resolve. Breaking hope breaks the spirit. Sarbjit for me was more about this will to keep the spirit alive versus the inhuman attempts at breaking it. Unfortunately though, Sarbjit had loftier aims of showing how all humans – Indian or Pakistani – are only human.  This aim it fails to achieve because it really has nothing new to say. Sarbjit's most glaring flaw would be its anecdotal nature. In its attempt at showing “this happened, then this happened, then this...but this was because that had happened a few years ago” Sarbjit completely misses out on connecting. And how is a story like Sarbjit to achieve whatever it has set out to do without that connection?While you could blame a film's missing connection on dialogue and performances, here it slips at the first step itself – the narrative. It doesn't help then that the other aspects of the film are trying so hard that the effort is way too obvious. Be it the dialogue, the protagonist's performance, the photography or the background score.The dialogue is rather film-y for a story based on true life. The use of browns and greys seem forced. Together with a background score (though beautiful at times) is screaming, “Look at us, we are so sad. Come on, you be sad too.”As harsh as it sounds, the same is true for Aishwarya Rai's performance too. Yes, I don't feel so good saying that her performance wasn't impressive because you can tell she has given it her all. The problem is that it shows. You always find yourself thinking, “oh wow, Aishwarya Rai is drawing on all the energy she has by bulging her eyes and screaming her lungs out” and never “I can't bear to see Sarbjit's sister in such pain.” Again we come back to not feeling the pain because there was no attempt as showing the times before the pain. The back and forth narrative is now a given for a grim, tragic story. You have to give the viewers a break, I guess. And the easiest way to give them a break is to flashback into happy times with a colorful song. But, the heroes (or victims) of these sad tales didn't get a break. I think this is the main reason we feel disconnected from the proceedings. We don't suffer for 10 continuous minutes what they suffered for over 2 decades. Of course, actors rise beyond these script limitations if they are up to it. Like Richa Chadda does in the one scene that her otherwise mute character is given. Randeep Hooda does well too but as ironic as it sounds it is not really his character, Sarbjit's movie. So, a movie about a wrongly imprisoned Indian in a Pakistani jail doesn't come off as a movie about other such cases. It is about, like a Pakistani character points out in the film, more about the ones suffering outside. It is about Sarbjit's sister's struggle. Interestingly, Sarbjit's wife and daughter correctly point out, after a while, it was the sister's struggle rather than anything else. This very human aspect along with the inhumanity of crushing hope are what made Sarbjit a better film than it really is. Masochistic it is, but for this film to be any better it would have to be a lot, lot sadder.

        ...As for this being Ms Bachchan’s Mother India, I am not too sure if hyperbole is an option here. Sarbjit has immense poignancy at its heart. But the execution of the theme of a homesick dying man imprisoned in a hostile country often tends to lean dangerously close to populism. Sarbjit manages to keep its head above the water even while the proceedings frequently revel in crowd-wooing conventions like singing dancing and rabble-rousing rhetorics.

Sarabjit is an ambitious story to pick for a second film, riddled as it is with undertones of Indo-Pak political tensions, human rights issues and the like. Kumar does a fair job, but the film bears the brunt of melodrama rearing its head in the form of flashbacks and over-the-top dialogue. And honestly, the director quoting himself at the end of the film is bizarre. ...

The result is a lot of visible hard work, but not quite a great performance. Chadha, catatonic for the most part, still manages to inject a few shades of doubt and jealousy into her under-written character. Rai Bachchan shows us Dalbir’s determination and little else. She attacks every scene with such hoarse fervour that she turns Dalbir into something less than a character and more of an ideal.
