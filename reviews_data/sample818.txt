It's brainless, it's banal, it's boring - nothing short of what you expect from an Anees Bazmi film.I go to watch films to like them. I rarely go with a preconceived notion because I believe that there will be something or the other to appreciate I the film - one scene, one joke, one song, one shot. Every single thing that I've seen or read about Thank you or know about its makers makes me resent the prospect of having to watch the film. I'm just not looking forward to watching this film because -

Just the trailers/song promos are insulting. Sample the first two seconds of this song promo  -
Too much negativity. Help! How do I walk into that theater and give this one a fair chance. It's almost crying for me to be unfair to it. It's wrong for the film to do this to me. The music too doesn't seem like it has anything to look forward to.
Music reviews:
milliblog - "Thankless, regurgitated noise. Pyaar mein offers minor solace, but overall, NW1W." - And that's the entire review!
music aloud - "6/10"
Bollyspice - "2.5/5"
Bollywood Hungama - "3.5/5"
HappySing - "I didn’t try listening to the remixes especially they were all merely ‘remix’es and mentioned nothing more specific than that."

  One would think we have enough films with three philandering husbands cheating on their gullible wives. Anees Bazmee is not that one. It's not the cheating that bothers me as it is the crassness and the way my mind goes numb for hours after watching such films. So, I actually looped with joy when there was no line at the online ticket counter. And the queue for current tickets was empty too! (I promise this had nothing to do with ample parking space available.)  An almost empty theater - die senseless films, die! And just before the film started I said, "come on Mr. Bazmee, make me regret my happiness." Nope not this time.

It's weird because the concept and where it's leading gives you the sense that it is anti-man and pro-woman. But, could it be any more derogatory to women if all main leads of the film have only one use for the fairer gender? Also, it wasn't comforting at all that only a man could bring a solution to all the women's problems. I'm no feminist (at least in the popular sense of the term) and don't mind seeing women as they are. But, a woman is either super-gullible or a piece of pretty furniture, seriously? 
We don't really expect much in terms of acting from Celina Jaitley and actually she isn't on screen long enough to prove either way. Don’t look at me boys, forward your complaints to Azmee. Sonam Kapoor still comes across as Bollywood's bachchi (kiddo), because the directors seem to be giving her one emotion per film. In this one she's made an unsuccessful attempt at sobbing to try and gain our sympathy. We are a desensitized lot, Baby Kapoor, you need to try harder and it better be quick, we aren't very patient either. And Rimi Sen can't blame herself. We have seen some awesome comic timing from her. She tries a fair bit here too, it just doesn't work. 
Well, if Irrfan Khan doesn't work, what else can? It's almost as if the director didn't want his actors to perform well. Suniel Shetty does the slapsticky bit (he made me laugh a couple of times) and Bobby Deol does the Bobby Deoly bit. 
Yes. That's it. That's all I have to say. Yes. That's my attempt at refusing to acknowledge any other "star" in the film who continues to assault my intelligence and gets support to do it again and again and again. This is my sign of 'non-support'.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Three husbands are cheating on their wives. A messiah of the martyr wives comes along to save their marriages.Three husbands are cheating on their wives. A messiah of the martyr wives comes along to save their marriages.
The titles. Stylish, nice!
Cinematography
The camerawork in the first fight scene. There was something different about it, don't know what it's called. But it looked really slick.

The make-up. Especially of the women.
The Krishna symbolism.
Choreography - awful!
Karva chaut! - no way!!
Akshay Kumar's monologue - a la Namastey London
@NGng & @yeahhh hmmm...i didn't like any of them except Deewangee.Shilpa :D that's exactly what i'm going to do. and yet, the optimist in me says, "if i'm going with negative expectations, maybe there'll be something i'll end up liking."Just back from the theater. By 5pm, hopefully.meetu your reviews are each week turning more and more professional.you are able to create the virtual admiration just like roger ebert,tasha robin,rajeev massand.i ll say there is no harm in making these movies atleast we are getting genuine answers for their insanely foolish attempts.Thanks guys! :)Oh we like your style of writing. To the point and cut throat. We also appreciate your honest reviews. We would be thrilled if you could publish a review about our next movie Teen Thay Bhai. Let us know if you need to see any particular trailers or behind the scene videos to write a pre-release review. Thank You.Paayalhey payal don't get furious upon meetu.Tell you what just check what other reviewers have said about your movie and how seemingly they have trashed it.if you did care about your film so much then why didn't you went through the script preciesly.Those days of ripping off movies and enjoying the box office have passed.Now there are plentifull internet site where reviewer are being paid just for reviewing.Times have really changed now and accordingly movies should be made.The audience now are more smart and intellectuals than back in late 90s.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
