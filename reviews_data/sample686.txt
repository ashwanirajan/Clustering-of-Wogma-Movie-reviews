Gore hidden behind special effects. So, no horror. And no comedy either. Tch, what a waste! Shiney Ahuja, the name, comes with a snicker and more. And just when I thought that the last joke on his personal laugh was dead, and thus his career, I saw a trailer of a film called Ghost and...well, I snickered. 

Interestingly, the giggle turned into the kind reserved for the on-the-face horror films. I admit, the gore in the trailer is pretty gross and it does unnerve you. But, somehow, the treatment to the subject seems to be as run-of-the-mill for the genre as can be. 
And yet, I know I get spooked very easily, so there is a good chance that Ghost will give me that creepy, under-the-skin crawl that any decent horror film ought to. That besides though, there isn't much to look forward to. The songs sound like any other genre from the Vikram Bhatt camp. And these views are echoed in the few music reviews for Ghost. 
It really doesn't feel like a movie that I'll enjoy watching, but might just end up being one which does what it sets out to do - chill the spine. 
Music Reviews:
Milliblog - "Functional music for the ghost"
Music Aloud - "6.25/10"
Happy Sing - "Somehow Sharib-Toshi are still able to maintain interest in their songs even with their repetitive style."

  One of the first few lines in Ghost go, "I'm a doctor. I have to behave responsibly, right?" And this along with the typical texture that goes with a B-grade horror film, seal the deal as far as how good the film is going to be. And the case gives itself little chance to be re-opened.

The little chance is afforded by the way in which spooks are created the first couple of times. Slimy insects and hardcore gore begin to do the do only to be rudely interrupted by special effects that make the images look like they are shot with a thermographic camera of some sort. I'm all game for filmmakers experimenting with techniques, but unfortunately this looked like a cop-out - a method in which they could avoid showing the implied gore. Or use of this technology was more feasible than the refined prosthetics skills that would be needed to pull it off. 
That could've made the film better in terms of number of genuine creeps provided. Unfortunately, the creeps come from cheesy dialogues in romantic situations like, "Why are you so beautiful, Suhani?" or "I'll not forget you till I forget myself." Incidentally, this is supposed to be a break from the 'intense' horror situations and thus the love affair is rhythmically interspersed with the core of the Ghost story. 
Usually this genre leave enough opportunities for the actors to scream, squeal and thus show their acting prowess. But Ghost's story doesn't have room for that because the lead pair barely every faces the spirit that's causing terror. Our man Shiney Ahuja has one break-down but that's about it. Sayali Bhagat has a few sequences to give a moderately scared expression and she quite firmly holds that one through most scenes - including the romance.

Shiney AhujaSpeaking of jokes, usually horror movies are associated with two kinds of laughter from the audience. One is kind that is at the film for trying to scare and the other is nervous laughter that comes right after a stand-alone spine-chilling scene. Ghost gives neither. 
It tries its bit of Christian symbolism with a character named Mary and frogs and locust-like insects, but the pace is so slow in many of the non-horror sequences that I could hardly be bothered to make sense of them. 
The only silver lining in this entire gamut of things that go wrong with Ghost is that it is directed by a woman. I don't think there are too many women have directed horror films. For what it's worth that needs to be applauded. And yet, I cannot recommend you to watch it even if you had nothing better to do.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Don't mind it meetu but u sound like favouring the film because it is made by a woman.Hos did you manage to sit through it, it sounds like pure torture!Absolutely unrecommended ! What a torture! Brutal murders, and more brutal murders.no story on gore and extremely brutal scenes. The director appears to be sick.@Guddu "Favoring the film"? I gave it a 'switch channels if it's on cable' rating! I wish I could have given it a better rating because it was a horror film made by a woman, but that was not possible :D@Sunil ha ha ha. that's how much i love my cinema :DCopyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.

Parental Guidance:


Violence: Loads and loads of gore. 
Language: Mostly clean. Religious bias shown in a few scenes.
Nudity & Sexual content: Skimpily clad women. A kiss. A making out scene.
Concept: A spirit is out to kill.
General Look and Feel: Typical B-grade horror movie stuff
