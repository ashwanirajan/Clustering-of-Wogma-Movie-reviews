Housefull 2 is nothing more and nothing less that what you'd expect from it. you know the director and his genre, so you know how you'll like the film. I was a tiny bit surprised with the momentum maintained in the chaos. But an 'aah...interesting' kind of a surprise doesn't necessarily make it a fun experience.After the initial shock of the intense trauma Housefull 2 promises to be, the logistical organizer in me was in awe of the scheduling nightmare that it must've been to shoot. The lead protagonist is a dirty dozen. 
Akshay Kumar, Asin, Rishi Kapoor
John Abraham, Jacquline Fernandez, Randhir Kapoor
Shreyas Talpade, Shazahn Padamsee, Boman Irani
Riteish Deshmukh, Zarine Khan, Mithun Chakrovarty
phew
Wait, it ain't over yet. There's support from cast like, Chunkey Pandey, Johnny Lever, and two reptiles called Fifi and Nagraaj. Check out the last 45 seconds of  if you don't believe me. Then there's the item number byMalaika Arora. And I read at various places Rani Mukherjee and Karishma Kapoor, hopefully, they are just names that might have been considered before the final decision. 
Now get this! I also came across Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Suresh Raina making special appearances in the film. Yep! You read that right! And I swallowed a tear of sorrow. Let's hope this is all one big rumor. 
It'd be only foolish of me to expect any form of coherent story or characterization in this chaos. I must confess that I do remember sort-of enjoying some moments from Housefull. But, I'm not sure I would want to endure Housefull 2 from what it shows in its trailers. The music though seems to be just alright given the genre. The rest we shall see, soon enough.

    - meeta, a part of the audience
  It's difficult to call the makers of Housefull 2 mindless or unintelligent. There's no way someone can make something so silly and not know it. It requires a high level of awareness to write and make a film so profoundly senseless. And from the manner in which the entire audience was laughing it looks like they have done their homework on what the 'first day first show' audience enjoys. Of course, none of this newfound admiration converts me into that part of the audience that enjoys such humor.

Given how little typical slapstick makes me laugh, it was almost a miracle that I laughed hard at a couple of the 'repeat phrase/expression' assigned to a couple of characters. And of course, they had to go ahead and spoil it by repeating it, for what feels like, a few hundred times! And that's the problem with films like these. They don't know where to stop, neither with their specific jokes nor the film itself. 
It's high time, we make it mandatory for writers to spend a year just on the climax. The utter tomfoolery in the last 20-30 minutes makes you want to bang your head on a wall harder than you were doing thus far. What with one of the worst opening sequences ever. 
Yet, a part of me is in awe of the writer's capacity to keep the utter chaos amongst twelve lead characters at a peak through most of the film. Of course again, I didn't enjoy the chaos but I certainly couldn't stop admiring how the writers seemed to have the story straight in their head amidst absolute commotion. 
The writing also attempts at a wide range of tools to create humor - from puns to rhymes to toilet humor to sexual jokes to sarcasm to 'pet phrases/expressions' to mimicry to what-say-you. Some work, most don't. Almost all repeat. 
Also, for a change I enjoyed Akshay Kumar and John Abraham's comic timing. Before it became repetitive. Amongst the women Asin gets a teeny-weeny bit to display her ability to make people laugh. While Riteish Deshmukh and Shreyas Talpade have as banal and inconsequential roles as the rest of the women, they at least are not insulted for being the gender they belong to. Please appreciate the amount of control I've maintained in not going all out and on and on about how ridiculously stupid ALL the women in the film are. Also, the lesser I say about the veterans  the quicker I'll be able to forget how insulted I felt by watching them in such menial roles. 
Housefull 2 is one of those rare films where I looked forward to the song breaks - nice, colorful, well-dressed good-looking people. That just about describes Housefull 2 in its entirety except that the film has some not-so-good-looking people too. 
Housefull 2 made me want to experience what it is the writers were having when they wrote it. Worry not, just as an experiment, one should know what it feels like, no?

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.@Anuj @Krishna Your comments put together give me the feeling that whatever I say about the film, I'm promised some brickbats!is this Sajid Khan's movie? coz i guess housefull 1 was his movie.  well, what can we expect from his movies.  after watching hey baby i realized that he is going to inflict a lot of torture on  the  viewers.nice review.  today i am reading all negative reviews.  i likes :D@Anuj I'm saying they are really intelligent people, though :P@debajyoti i know exactly what you mean! But, from the reaction of the people around me, it looks like he'll get enough encouragement to make Housefull 3 :)@anuj sorry, looks like a technical glitch. Will get it fixed.I will be sharing my experience tomorrow as i have nothing to do better . Also i want to see the six glamorous ladies , i don't think i will be disappointed to a greater extent... By d way Meetu i always follow your reviews and 90% of the time , my views are equal to your opinion but this time i am doubtful to your review. I think you might have miscalculated this film .@guddu and..?@Vikramjeet, @Aashkaran Like I said, for movies like these, reviewers are guaranteed one thing, brickbats - if the reviewer likes the film they get it from the one's who think the film is dumb, if they hate the film they are labelled by the people who thought it was paisa vasool...oh well... :)@Anuj ha ha. JA lovers say, 'not enough'. Brickbats ka toh aisa hai na Anuj, it's a mandatory part of the package.@Anuj I don't understand "its a lot more easier and safer reviewing smaller jems like Kahaani,PST,Udaan and A Wednesday" I've reviewed all types of films over the last 5 years. Why would be 'safer' to review one type versus the other? I remember getting horribly bored in Jodhaa Akbar, especially the romance, despite arguably two of the most beautiful looking people there could be.you think we are spared? I've experienced otherwise. I don't believe you mentioned Hrishikesh Mukherji films in the same vein as Jodha Akbar and Guzaarish. For me Hrishikesh Mukherjee films were all about simplicity and focus on content, even though they had the best stars from their day. JA was hardly simple and knew not where to focus, unless of course you are comparing it to Asoka and Veer.@Anuj I didn't expect JA to be simple, I have a strong objection to any similarity being drawn between Hrishikesh Mukherjee films and any of the current directors' filmography. :D I don't remember getting bored in any Hrishikesh Mukherjee film that I've seen, however slow it was, except Jhoot Bole Kauwa Kaate which was well... :(@B H Harsh sorry, there was a data entry error. Thanks for pointing it out.@Anuj paaayn! galat jawaab!! Even my current favorite male actor is Amitabh Bachchan. (doesn't mean I like ALL his films, of course) :D  I liked Dharmendra's older films more than the ones from the 80s. Guru Dutt and Dilip Kumar, with all respect, were too serious for me, I liked their films but not necessarily would watch out of choice. Raj Kapoor - never enjoyed his films, not that I've seen too many of them.@Anuj Of course, I have reviewed RGV films! I liked Sarkar, except for the caricaturish 'villains'. If I had to rate it, I would think it would be 'The keen must watch on screen; else DVD' @Abhay :)@Aditya exactly! It is difficult to call them stupid. That's what I'm saying too!wow....meetu, u must b one of the "intellectually superior" people in ur school, and subsequently in ur gang, right? n lemme guess, a huge fan of amir khan? how i luv u guys...always gives me great pleasure seeing u in deep thought, trying to change the world by lighting a candle, always looking for messages in everything...how cute. since i hv come across tonnes like u, i wudnt say much (this after i've written half a novel!!)...i watch movies to be entertained, and this movie entertained me...the minute i need a message or lesson, i will step outside to the real world, thank u very much. the fact that this movie, and many like these, r such huge hits really shudnt bother u...coz u dnt write/review for the general public...if u did, where wud the elitist charm go?  :D  (akshay kumar  fan)@rachit :)Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
