
wogma rating: Watch if you have nothing better to do (?)
No laughs from this one. Well, at least for me. If the name hasn't put you off immediately, the trailer certainly will. A Singh who doesn't get anything right falls in love at first sight with a woman coming out of the ocean in a swim suit. Can it get more unimaginative?That it has Akshay Kumar doing the honours with Prabhu Deva holding the reins, hardly rules in its favor. Nope, this once even Kay Kay Menon doesn't look like he will be able to help. Oh well, another one for me to hope against hopes that I will find at least two minutes worth of entertainment.

  From one film that wants you to think even after you are out of the theater into another that begs you to not even try – such is the scene at the theaters this week. I take solace in the fact that films in the Singh is Bliing genre have started making an attempt at some sort of a story. That they end up doing a blotchy job is another matter. People can't be expected to be good at everything. If they are so good at using saturated color and saturated sound too, they slip in the writing department. Is that such a crime?For some of us, yes. And we shall stick to it, even if the film is in the Akshay Kumar genre. Sure, the theater was in splits a lot of the time. It also sounded like they were laughing with the film, that had created that humor intentionally even. But, people peeing at each other or a dog dressed as a lion, never made me laugh as a child, don't make me laugh now. Some of the humor is creative, but still not funny.Other than that it is the usual loud fest and plastic performances with Akshay Kumar trying his best to infuse some life into the film. Lara Dutta does get a smile or two out but the randomness of the character is quite distracting. Of course, it can be argued that random equals funny. Amy Jackson is expectedly insufferable. The film tries to make its point about women empowerment and also throws in a bit on religious tolerance in the end. But, how can you take any of it seriously when empowerment is made equal to become protector from protect-ee, as if there is no in-between?Yes Meeta, do not go about over-intellectualizing what is not meant to be. Let go. Okay, at least tell me this – Singh didn't seem very bling, why name him so?

        ...For that infectious grin that lights up the screen every time Akshay’s Raftaar is happy – and he is happy most of the time — Singh Is Bling is worth a dekko. Rowdier than Rathod, Akshay’s Raftaar Singh is gloriously goofy and a great deal of fun to watch. Never mind the logistics. The fun never wanes.

Over all movie is comedy type and you can enjoy movie with family.

        ...It isn't particularly comforting to see the writing credit go to a company. Creative ideas are rarely churned out on an assembly line and it's a shame that the humans responsible for the onscreen fun of Singh is Bliing have to be reduced to Grazing Goat. That said, there isn't much by way of a plot or storytelling in this film. It's essentially a set of well-written comic sketches, featuring recurring characters. There's nothing evolved or sophisticated about this film, but that doesn't mean it's not worth a watch. Singh is Bliing is  — and it might be just what the doctor ordered to lift your spirits after watching Talvar.

But that’s probably not a fair demand because Prabhu Dheva actually arrives to make clear his intentions. In a lavatory, he aims and sprinkles his tinkle on Akshay. I was wrong.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Looking at the female lead, and the promo trailer above - looks like the movie is banking only on Akshay.  For a Prabhudeva film looks less southern compared to few of his recent past films - but then promos have regularly deceived.This might not be the masterpiece of the year, but if it is able to wipe out the disappointment of past few weeks with some pure unadulterated entertainment then it would be nice.Looks like the deleted portions from Singh is King have been put together and made into a movie, something like what Dabangg 2 & Singham 2 have looked like earlier. But the advantage is that unlike D2 and S2 which came within 2-3 years from their originals, Singh is Bling comes a good 7 years after SIK. Although Akshay's star power currently is nowhere near what it was when SIK released, I'm sure that if SIB is entertaining enough, the audiences will be ready to lap up Akshay in a Sardar avatar for a second time over.@Meetu: reading your review on Singh is King (http://wogma.com/movie/singh-is-kinng-review/) I would suggest that you stay off this new Singh adventure.  It seems a slightly degraded version of the original - so if the original horrified you then this second installment is not going to help. :-)Anyone with a pen in hand is a reviewer these days. But the funniest part is, these worthless good for nothing reviews keep coming up from time to time despite these reviewers knowing for a fact that their ratings would make a rat's difference to a commercial movie's prospects. I guess the only purpose of existence for reviewers these days is to review snoozefests like talvar and lunchbox and go orgasmic about how cinematically thought provoking they are when factually, 99% of the audience would rather watch Akshay Kumar's antics over Irrfan and Konkana's poker face which has been boring us to death for over 2 decades now! Unfortunately, Meeta Kabra's reviews these days are getting as bogus as Raja Sen's and wannabe Raja Sen's like Mihir Fadnavis' (if not worse).@meetu just take a look at latest reviews by you, 'watch if you have nothing better to do' or 'switch channels if...' which film do you expect that it will break this enlarging tail?Moment of extreme laughter scattered across an otherwise boring film. Read my review on :http://thesimplemoviereviewer.blogspot.in/The bumbling good for nothing but good hearted Singh is back. This time protecting another English speaking Indian damsel.  The film looks a continuation of Singh is king. It's a Prabhudheva film but still as far removed from Southern loudness as the North Pole is from the South Pole. One might even doubt if it's not another chap called Prabhudheva.  As if he had sensed this, Prabhu makes a cameo to reassure viewers that he is at the helm of affairs. There's no story. The film is a composition of one gag after another.  Akshay Kumar holds the entire show united and enjoyable to watch. Lara Dutta amazed with her small role.  I  found Amy alright in the role that she was given.  She is more believable than Katrina in Singh is king. And I  liked the fact that there was no attempt made to force her to speak in Hindi. Of course this has a negative commercial impact because in the hard core Hindi belts this film may not work due to generous use of  English. It's a light entertainer, and yes for some of us, we will stick to patronising light entertainment.  It's not a must watch, so no regrets if you miss it. On the other hand, as a buffer between a long wait amongst two good films if you do crave for some on screen entertainment then do watch it without being ashamed - it's a paisa vasool film. The theatre where I watched it erupted in whistles when Akshay with his intense look sprouted pro-Sardar dialogues like Singh kabhi aurat pe haath nshin uthata. Feel good. And for the feminists shouting blasphemy at such dialogues, well ..., grow up.Well, we liked Singh is Kinng and AK's Well-Meaning Bozo films in general, so if this pops up on Eros Online or Netflix Streaming we'll probably give it a try....Dont  have anything to discuss , except good 45mins at the start of the movie (just becuase of comic timing of AK) rest of the movie was waste of the time. Keeping everything aside , Just One Thing To say , never seen K K Menon doing such a bad character..Cant decide whether Nazir in Welcome Back or K K menon in SIB is more irritating.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
