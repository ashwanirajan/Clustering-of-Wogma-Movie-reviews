
wogma rating: Owner's Pride! (?)
Life is one long vacation, if you can dare yourself to think of it that way. We are a generation that can afford to live life moment-by-moment. So, why aren't we. Go watch the film, before all the people who've loved it get you so excited about it that you are left disappointed. It's raining "guy" films, Pyaar Ka Punchnama, Delhi Belly, and now Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara. Given the track record of the earlier two and the promos of the latest addition, there is a lot to look forward to. Cinematography that promise to justice to the exotic locations. Crazy adventure sports. One long bachelor party. What's there not to like. Also, this promises to be much cleaner than the other two films on this list of bachelor fun. 
But wait, there is something and some more for the girls too. A chiseled Greek god statue disguised as Hrithik Roshan, a good actor in Abhay Deol who has picked some of the most interesting scripts and just cho-chweet-how-can-you-not-like-him Farhan Akhtar. 
It is also interesting that the promo has already set up the characters and their situation. There seems to be no conflict to pull us to the theaters, only the fun and "cool" factors. The dialogues, however, are pretty disappointing already - both in terms of the actual lines and the off-timing in their delivery. Hopefully, it is just a case of bad promo editing and they will work just fine in the film. 
I have faith in both the writers, Reema Kagti and Zoya Akhtar. Same cannot be said though about Farhan Akhtar's dialogue writing, though. My fingers are crossed that if the dialogue is as lame as it looks, hopefully, it won't take away too much from the story. 
Similarly, the choice of the lead ladies could also go either way. I somehow wouldn't have imagined either Katrina Kaif or Kalki Koechlin in a film by Zoya Akhtar. Nice to see a break from preconceived notions and the underlying stereotypes. 
Meanwhile, from what I hear and read, the music is what one would expect from Shankar, Ehsaan and Loy. Here's more -
milliblog - " Nuanced, mature and engaging soundtrack from the trio!"
music aloud - "7.25/10"
Bollyspice - "4/5"
Bollywood Hungama - "3.5/5"
HappySing - "ZNMD is something to celebrate"
Planet Radiocity - "3.5/5"

    - meeta, a part of the audience

  I loved Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara. I don't know if it will last long enough to become classic or cult (never understood those terms). But, I enjoyed every single moment that I spent in that theater. Yes, even though it was a full two-and-a-half-hour-long film. Three friends are off to Spain to close on a deal they made with each other years ago - each will choose an adventure that the three of them have to experience together. The characters are alive, the cast is lively, the writer is thoughtful and the movie is clean, soft, perceptive entertainment.





(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});


There is nothing profound about Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara; neither does it bring any insight that you and I don't already have from our own relationships. But, it connects from the word go. Maybe, I connected with it instantly because some of the things are too close to home. 
I've spent a lovely week-long, road-trip in Spain. I've walked through the little towns on their narrow, stone-bricked lanes. I've lived in the quaint hotels with their lovely lobbies.  And the cinematographer brings all of this alive. Spain, what a beauty you are! 
Add to this nostalgic mood, a piece of adventure that the three friends are experiencing. Deep sea diving, my latest addition to the "I love" list. And sky-diving which I've wanted to do (with my mom, no less!) for the last 15 years. The third adventure, uh...well...that one I think I'll play the woman card and leave it at, "I'm happy to enjoy it vicariously through Abhay Deol, Farhan Akhtar and Hrithik Roshan."
Also fast getting on the list of "I love" are these three men! And goodness, even Katrina Kaif. Abhay Deol is instantly endearing as the sorted-out, problem-free, likeable guy who runs a little above average on emotion for a man. Farhan Akhtar's Imran is aptly described as an a$$hole. He plays the perfect shallow-outside-deep-inside, observant poet who doubles up as the comic relief. If I had to pick a weak-link it'd be Hrithik Roshan, but I'd be nit-picking about how his acting falls flat in the second half. He, after all, did get me annoyed with his "oblivious to my arrogance" attitude. 
Usually, introductions bore me; they are too in the face. And climaxes, disappoint me. The better the build-up towards it, the worse the fall in the end. Very few films manage the climax that is Goldilock's "just right". Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara's set-up is so subtle, that you don't even realize that's what it is till the opening credits begin. And the climax is yep, "just right"! A minute more after that would have been too much. 
Yeah-yeah-yeah, there I do have my mandatory reviewer's disclaimer "There are couple of flawed moments." But you know what, they pass by quickly, and the fun/sweet moments are many more.
Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara like zindagi itself, is about mistakes. It's about closure and the importance of closures. Because only then can we move on. Only then, can we have that new beginnings, we so deserve. 
"Life is a once-only gift. Live it to the fullest."  The cliché was alien to our parents. And is becoming the mantra of our responsibility-free generation. And why not? New money is becoming easier to get and even easier to spend. Savings is a dated concept. Because who knows? You might live long enough to enjoy retirement. Reminder: We live in a world of tsunamis and bomb blasts. So, there is merit to "live the moment"
So, when are you planning your next vacation? Fine, fine, take your time. Meanwhile, book your tickets before the praise that I've just showered upon the film raises your expectations so high, that they will only fall.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.A road trip. Three friends are off to Spain to close on a deal that they had promised themselves when they were in school - each will choose an adventure that the other two have to go along with. A road trip. Three friends are off to Spain to close on a deal that they had promised themselves when they were in school - each will choose an adventure that the other two have to go along with. 
The excitement in the air before the show began. I love my 'first day first show' crowd.
The innocence with which Kabir (Abhay Deol) admires his friend Imran's (Farhan Akhtar) humor.
Hrithik Roshan's eyes, expression and body language in a scene outside a gym, where he meets his ex.
The thick, cold air between Hrithik Roshan and Farhan Akhtar and the chemistry that creates it.
Bagwanti! Such a participant she was. She told me how it was too much money for Imran, too little for Kabir (Abhay Deol) and whatever for Arjun (Hrithik Roshan).
Katrina Kaif's attempt at improving her diction.
Poetries in the background. Brilliant. When was the last time we had poetry read out by a character?
The fact that the movie is beyond male-bonding.
Hrithik Roshan doing the SRK-arms-spread action in a dance to the word mohabbatein. 
The senorita song.
The drunken philosophies.
The cameos by the veterans. Won't give away their names. Such a fine example of how good actors can leave their mark in just 2-minutes of screen-time.
The hurt that "two people want different things" brings. Even if it is between a father and son.

Katrina Kaif pep speech. Blah! But was short, so that's good. 
The standard silhouette shot of the four sky-divers going towards an airplane. But then again, the background music for that sequence had me in splits.
B H Harsh, I guess I think of our film fraternity in terms of families or sub-fraternities, and both Katrina and Kalki seem like they are from different ones.@Apoorv i was referring to the dialogue that are in the promos. They seemed pretty blah in the promo, but in the film it all works :D So all good!And Mohit, Vishal and Harsh, wherever you guys are! This notepad is dedicated to you! I don't know you all, but if you guys didnt read it regularly, I wouldn't have written it. And while writing it wouldn't have realised how much I enjoy writing it and what purpose it serves. :DTimely review, thanks for watching this one first day, first show, first rowYour review says that your'e extremely pleased and it's really a commendable effort. Long time i am hearing such a glorifying review. I knew that it would be a worth watching  but i was  reluctant because of the assemble  cast which include some of the people i hate. But now i think your review has raised my zeal to check it out for sure.Neetish not first row, i just cannot do that. :Dguddu, yeah it was a good 2.5 hours@lost in confusion no-no, not at all like hangover (i hated it, if that helps you arrive at a conclusion)@shashank thank you! ;)I knew this one would get a good rating from you because - You did not give great ratings to Shor in the City, Shaitan and Delhi BellyHere is my take on it:The movie is an excellent setup for Spain Tourism promotionIf you love to see guys, this movie is again, brilliant!Katrina Kaif looks better than in most movies and I am not a fan of Kalki K.The Cinematography is the only thing that stood out. Brilliant. But full stop at that.I could not remember the tunes when I walked out of the theater - contrary to many other recent movies. The story was very simple, nothing in it, quite shallow and painfully slow. Acting - Abhay Deol and Farhan were genuine. Hrithik has started believing in his great body and that is all he showed in the movie, nothing as an actor, really. The film started off setting great expectations when they said they were going on a Bachelor's Trip... but there was nothing really in it. It was a Travel & Living Channel Show, with a few comments on Moral Education.I think, it is a Must watch on the big screen only for the cinematography. And if you have loved some of the recent movies - Shor in the City, Yeh Saali Zindagi, Shaitan, Delhi Belly... you will find this movie quite painful.@Aditya I don't see what one film has to do with another. They are all entirely independent of each other (and please note, that I liked Delhi Belly, and I didn't hate the others you have mentioned. On the same note, it's very interesting that you haven't brought up the other films I have liked and didn't like. I'm sure with the range of films that I have liked you will find some that you liked to...Gulaal? Manorama six feet under? Tere bin laden? Udaan? Stanley ka dabba?Also, you agree that cinematography is brilliant. But somehow, it still should have made an effort to make Spain look less beautiful?@Vishal What is "to each his own" technically?@Harpreet thanks for your review! :D@Anand @Parkisht exactly!!Meetu,I did not say that you did not rate the other movies well... but I would rather watch some of the other movies on Big Screen than this. Spain is beautiful, but there is nothing the producers did to make it look beautiful, nor the actors did something. The point I am trying to make is that as a movie, there really isn't anything in it- Acting is mediocre- Music is mediocreand - Story is very mediocre as wellAnd I would agree with one of the comments, this movie is not the case of "To each his own".Here are my ratings:    Direction: 4    Story: 2    Lead Actors: 2    Character Artists: 2    Dialogues: 2    Screenplay: 4    Music Director: 3    Lyrics: 3And so, the sum and the averages are low~Zindagi na milegi dobara is a nice entertaining movie i enjoyed a lot watch this movie in this site:http://www.watch-hindi-movies.com/@Durgesh i don't think @lost-in-confusion has seen ZNMd. He was asking me, not telling me.@someone_talked_of10 yay! we agree!!@Kishore what? come again please. i lost you at "Hrithik Abhay and Farhan all are oxymoronic"@keyur yep! exaactly!!@mohit thanks to you for the encouragement. you missed that step? koi nahi...go again!! :P@aditya oh no-no...are you saying the cinematography and other production values have nothing to do with how beautiful Spain came across? And if it is a job well done, how does it matter which country it promotes?I am really curious why "this movie is not the case of "To each his own"? why?@jj i've noticed that each one of us, who has liked the film, has taken something different away from the film. that is such an awesome thing the film has achieved.@Nirmal yeah long time! glad we agree. I like your point about chemistry. But for me, the cold air between Imran and Arjun was chemistry too. @lost in confusion lol! your sermons, your tareef and your gaalis (not literally, but disagreement and disappointment) are all welcome here :D" Hrithik Roshan doing the SRK-arms-spread action in a dance to the word mohabbatein. "which song was that? senorita? didnt notice it :(The movie was good.. because I didn't hear too much about it before I saw it.. the dialogues were funny even when i heard them the second time..after having seen it in trailer.. the bits about their actual adventures was not as enthralling as I would have like..for instance the underwater part, Actual that scene was better shot in Kites..Wish they had taken more pains in it.. Anyway, its been a long time since i went to a movie for which it was hard to get tickets :) good fun@ligne yeah, the SRK-arm-spread was in the Senorita song. I loved the underwater bit here. It might have to do with what it meant to the characters. Not only the way it was explained later, but what they felt while they were under water.@lost_in_confusion if only, i didn't know that my kids and a few nephews and nieces weren't reading what's written here :D@kapil wow! from your first comment I thought you hated the movie, and in your second one it looks like you enjoyed bits and pieces reasonably well. oh well, to each his own in different moods and modes too!By far one of the best films of the year. It was so real in many ways. Probably, the financial divide was dragged a bit too much. Music was understated and performances crisp, except Hritik.@Wild ha ha ha ha ha ha....out of this world, hilarious!@Nivii wow! your review has brought me a smile. :DSimply brilliant! Zoya Akhtar kills ii with this one!@Meetu - We American Bollywood Fans liked this one a lot, too. The cinematography of Spain was gorgeous, the acting was uniformly excellent (no problem here w/Hrithik Roshan's performance), the story was mainly an intelligent one (if a bit too convenient - did <b><i>every</b></i> "secret desire" have to have one guy who was phobic, and had to overcome his fear?), the fianc=C3=A9e Natasha was a bit of a caricature though she improved as the story went on, Ms. Kaif's Jock version of the Manic Pixie Dream Girl was surprisingly likeable if (again) a bit too convenient (so she keeps popping up just so Roshan's Arjun can fall in love with her?). But those are just quibbles - it was a great way to spend a Sunday evening, and looked smashing in DVD on a 42" HDTV set....@TimELiebe this is one of those films that has universal appeal. I love watching this one with my kids and they don't mind repeat watches either. Yes, despite the quibbles and makes for near 100% engagement and enjoyment.Direction: 4Story: 3Lead Actors: 4Character Artists: 4.5Dialogues: 4.5Screenplay: 4.5Music Director: 3.5Lyrics: 3.5Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
