Kamaal Dhamaal Malamaal should show up in the thesaurus look up for incoherent and 'all over the place'. Such a shame to see likes of Paresh Rawal, Om Puri and Nana Patekar in such lame roles.Another story by Priyadarshan with a good-for-nothing protagonist being proud of doing nothing, his only complaint being he is hit by anyone and everyone. The humor shall be added this once by a very hungry bodyguard to this protagonist, played by Nana Patekar. The very mention of 'very hungry' bring visuals of Nana Patekar stuffing his face in the name of comedy. And voila, all predictions come true right in the trailer.So, we are to look forward to the regular loud, slapsticky environment that Priyadarshan creates. And this time the very basis of the plot is a hero being slapped around! You can tell how excited I am about watching this one, despite having Shreyas Talpade and Nana Patekar who are known to have good comic timing. When the content is not something that appeals, what can one do. Yet, like always, we shall watch and hope for the best.Music Reviews:

  As expected, Kamaal Dhamaal Malamaal is everything we thought it would be – loud, ridiculously incoherent and annoyingly induces sleep. Yep, I strongly resisted my urge to nod off while waiting for the interval. I guess it was too loud to let me doze off.
It is such a shame to watch Paresh Rawal repeat himself endlessly and try to put his heart into it. It is so frustrating to watch Om Puri be at his loudest best. It is so disappointing to see Nana Patekar come back after such a long time and have nothing to do with his character except play emotionless, which of course he does well. And it is extremely upsetting to see Shreyas Talpade reduced to shouting in the name of acting. I am not even going to venture into talking about the plot and how it doesn't make sense, about the character transformations, etc. Any effort I put in seems like it would be more than what the writers could be bothered with. The minutest interest is triggered with how good-for-nothing and shameless Johnny (Shreyas Talpade) is. But that too wears off. How long can you hold on to yelling after all? What I am left with after the film is this ordeal of course of having to review it. But also with this thought. It's easy to pass a verdict and say that such films shouldn't be made. But, what if this is the only thing that keeps these actors in the game? And the trade-off is that it also keeps these directors/writers in too. Tough call.
