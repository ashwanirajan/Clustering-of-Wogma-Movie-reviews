Love Breakups Zindagi is a very sedate kind of a relationships film. It is a casual and everyday-like take on the subject but it also turns out to be long-drawn and boring. Not worth a trip to the theaters for the one or two insightful things it has to say about romantic relationships.Love Breakups Zindagi seems to be satisfying this week's requirement of the "a rom-com a week" trend. And given how clichéd the genre can get, the movie looks promising. Despite, Zayed Khan. Case-in-point, minute 1:33 in the trailer below. Awesome line, awful delivery.There are other light, fun elements in the film. Also, the film seems to be based on a theme within the "romance" sphere - that of the fallacy behind "opposites attract". 
"Is this your story?" the closing line of the trailer probes. Not mine, but I'd love to watch it. Okay-okay maybe some bits in my relationship too has fallen prey to the said fallacy. But, that's the beauty isn't it? ANY relationship would have some elements that face in diagonally opposite directions, and it becomes a restraint in one way or the other. I think it'd be fun to make fun of that, and in some sense celebrate those differences via the characters. 
The hope is that the other actors do a better job at timing their lines. And of course, another hope is that not all the punch lines are exhausted in the trailer. 
Something about the trailer, makes me look forward to the film. I think a lot of it goes to the light look of the film. And the background music that enhances the peppy feel. The music isn't being raved about, but has gotten above average reviews. Here's hoping that the movie rings a similar tune with its audiences.

  Love Breakups Zindagi has very deliberately written and made film. You can see the thought put in the growth of the characters and their interactions. Unfortunately, the makers aren't able to build momentum soon enough. They take too long to establish the chemistry between various characters and it ends up being a little too slow.





(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});


Unfortunately, this happens because they are trying to imitate life. It takes time to establish friendships and romantic relationships. The little things that attract people to each other take their own sweet time to reveal themselves. Real people give a lot of thought before breaking up with their partner and it is a tough decision. But, there are times when the slow pace works in a film and there are times when it doesn't. In Love Breakups Zindagi it mostly doesn't. 
Sadly, it is not for lack of trying. I really like the simple theme picked to make the film about, "Opposites attract, but choose a like-minded partner" but ironically, the simplicity makes it too dull. The effort is visible. The restraint in spending about 30-45 minutes of a film in a wedding set-up and keeping it quite is visible and I actually appreciate it too. But, the dialogue is too plain and thus too boring. 
Maybe, if the film were left to better actors, it would have pepped the film up a bit. But, Zayed Khan just doesn't work as a romantic hero. Every time he tries to emote a sentimental emotion, he brings a cringe. Dia Mirza is good as the confused girl who wants to do the right thing, but there is nothing special about her. Cyrus Sahukar has an effected dialogue delivery, the words don't flow. Tisca Chopra is the only one who looks competent and fit for her role, but then again this must be a cake walk for her. 
I usually, avoid talking about cameos, but here Shah Rukh Khan's special appearance brings about a very real, very believable reaction from Naina (Dia Mirza). It is adorable. But other than that the cameo, like most cameos, is dispensible. 
And that hurts because the biggest culprit in Love Breakups Zindagi's failure is the length. Had these cameos been chopped off, had a couple of side-stories been taken away, the film would be a crisper product rather than a limp one, which you are most likely to watch among many other things while flipping channels. 
Love Breakups Zindagi is one of those cases where rating it as "watch if you have nothing better to do" sounds a bit too harsh. It doesn't have laugh out loud or super-aawwww moments. But it is sweet and it does have a few relatable insights about relationships. But you have to be a very patient person to enjoy them.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Girl (Dia Mirza) meets boy (Zayed Khan). Only problem is girl has already met another boy and boy has already met another girl. Now what?Girl (Dia Mirza) meets boy (Zayed Khan). Only problem is girl has already met another boy and boy has already met another girl. Now what?
Naina's (Dia Mirza) disappointment when she finds out her boyfriend is showing up.
I liked the fact that the choreography in the sangeet dance wasn't professional. Gave the wedding a very homely feel.
Dia Mirza outfit in the dance mentioned above.
The breakups are handled by characters in a very mature fashion.

"main se meena se na saaki se" was cute for a bit, but the entire song?! Goodness no!
How come ALL people who have come for a wedding have appropriate white clothes for a funeral?!
There is no high point or conflict in the film.
Ritu's side story.
Boman Irani's character.
Riteish Deshmkh's character.
Shah Rukh Khanbeing himself.
Shah Rukh Khan handing away gyaan on relationships.
The "do it for biji" spiel in the end!
Nice to read this post..very live !!While reading the review I was remembering a Brazilian writer from my creative writing classes."Art has to seem life-like but it should be without the boring parts of real life, that is the skill of the writer", she used to repeat.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
