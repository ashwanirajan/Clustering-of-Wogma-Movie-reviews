
wogma rating: Add to 'must watch' list (?)
Lootera reminds you of the times you have wondered, why people fall in love despite themselves.The last thing you'd expect after watchng Vikramaditya Motwane's Udaan is his next film to be a romance. Or for it to star Sonakshi Sinha in the lead. But hey, here you have it and just this bit makes you look forward to it. The first trailer though isn't too impressive. It feels too much like a typical love story. Also, Sonakshi Sinha's suppressed dialogue delivery gets annoying very quickly. However, the second trailer got my curiosity and I'm now looking forward to it. It sounds and feels like a tragedy that will suck you in. The situation, of a guy who fakes love for whatever reason and inevitably falls in love with the girl who he was trying to fool, isn't novel at all. In fact, we have had Ranveer Singh himself do it in Ladies Vs Ricky Bahl. But, the treatment, the halted pace suck you in. The music seems to have been loved across board. Oh, wouldn't it be nice to have two lovely romances in a span of one month!Music Reviews:
Bollyspice - "3.5/5" 
Bollywood Hungama - "3/5" 
dunkdaft - "Still, this is one 'must hear' soundtrack, that shows how versatile AT can be." 
FirstPost - "If Lootera's soundtrack had any other music director's name on it, then all of these songs would have thrilled all of us. For Trivedi though, perhaps unfairly, the standards are higher and we want every song to be strikingly original and memorable."   
IBN Live, IANS - "3.5/5"   
koimoi - "4/5"   
Milliblog - "Trust Amit to spring back with a vengeance from his recent middling state!" 
Music Aloud - "8.5/10"

  thehraav is the one word that kept coming to mind all through watching Lootera. Literally translated it means 'pause' or even 'permanence'. But a usage that applies better is when the word is used for notes to be held while singing. To keep the voice from cracking or going flat while holding a note, a singer needs control of breath and voice. This is the control you see in Lootera. And the moment you see yourself using a word applied to music, while watching a film, you know you are not watching just a film, it is poetry in motion. There are a few points which put you off what's going on but the beauty of the climax sets everything right.I haven't seen a climax as mesmerising as Lootera's. It's not a twist, it's not a revelation. In fact, it is predictable. It is just pure love. It is a shame then, that the makers felt the need to explain it in such detail with flashbacks and repetitions. And I am in love with the finish, despite this reservation.I am getting ahead of myself though. The first thing that should be told to people who want to know whether or not they should watch Lootera is that the film takes its slow pace very seriously. It is almost as if the makers want to push the envelope on how long a pause can be held, a scene can go on without background music, and so on. It does help that the film is set in the 50s.  The times when, most likely, people enjoyed their pauses. To top it off, you have a palace, the majesty of which is waning with the abolishment of the zamindari system. Amidst this is the daughter of a zamindar (Pakhi) who is falling in love with a guy who's job it is to take advantage of the zamindar's situation (Varun). There is something not so old school about the way Varun's (Ranveer Singh) relationship with Pakhi (Sonakshi Sinha) develops. Sure, there are distances and awkward exchange of glances but there is also boldness about Pakhi's demeanour that you do not associate with the 50s. Yet, this does not take away from your experience. And of course, references to films and songs from that era take you charmingly back to the ambiance of the film. Also, along with the 'paused' treatment, the film has a heavy grainy texture to add to the feel of that era - something reserved for flashbacks in films. You do feel like you are watching a two-hour long flashback, like someone has transported you to those times to narrate a story to you, that can be best enjoyed only if it is told only in that one tone. The camera complements this tone and moves like it is in love with its object. Be it Sonakshi or a street in Dalhousie or a barren tree. The performances then are like the last cog that need to fit in well, to make this clock work. While one can say that both Ranveer Singh and Sonakshi Sinha got by with just one or two expressions, it would be unfair to them both. With the limited range that the roles offer, you don't know what to make of their performances. And when you don't know if an actor acted well or not, it is safe to say they did a darn good job. After all, you are rooting for Varun even though he has wronged other people grossly. You don't think Pakhi is being stupid when she is falling in love, despite herself. You know her confidence, you know her insecurity. And her elegance shines through both. A couple scenes between them will stay with me for a long time. 
The dialogue is kept simple. No way does it want to interfere with the silences, neither do you want it to. There is a little bit of fun thrown in every once in a while but it always keeps with the spirit of the film. There are lapses in the way the story plays out and they are rather looming ones or rely heavily on coincidence. And yet, if you are in for a sweet-paced travel back to 60 years ago, you let go of those. If you want action and entertainment (in the funny fun sense of the word), you don't want to watch Lootera at all. It has no story, as such. Nothing is going to 'happen'. It is a simple love story.

Do not watch Lootera.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.lootera : movie is coming soon waiting for this, hope this will be good movie...................:) must watchwhy am I getting the feeling that this film will end up being rather boring while attempting to become a milestone in Bollywood!!@Nirmal oh no! I am getting a good feeling. Let's exchange notes later. :Da classic tale,,its like aslow poetry going on,,,,to love astranger,,relation of father anddaughter who is ill,,cop vs herochase,,,,some political turns related tozamidaars after india got independentand some very shocking twists inbefore interval....The directer doesnt have hurry foranything,,,,his execution for the movieis very slow and motwane doesntbother this,,,,he is just concentratedon what he want to show instead ofwhat audience wants to see... I m not a big fan of amit trivedi as amusic directer but believe me,,,,thisman has done a tremendous job in thismovie,,,,sawaar loon,,sikayatein andzinda hoon mein are some songs likewhich doesnt being discovered muchin bollywood,,,,background score is attop notch,,,,in every second of themovie the back ground score will tie uup with the movie,,,,cinematography is very beautiful,,,,editing could have been a litl crisp in thesecond half but its ok.... u know I was so muchshocked by seeing that sonakhi canreally act very well,,,,infact she wasthe soul of the movie,,,,from a childishgirl who live with her farther in aluxurious life to a girl who is fightingfor the living she was perfect,,,,andsame can be said for ranbir,,,,he reallyhave too much potential to go head tohead with the other actors in thisindustry,,,,and vikrant as ranbir's frndwas great,,,,he definatly will get morerole after this,,,,....this one is a must watch if not in big screen then at home,,,,but needs some patince,,,,This movie show the era and way of making movies which bollywood have almost forgotten....a classic tale,,its like aslow poetry going on,,,,to love astranger,,relation of father anddaughter who is ill,,cop vs herochase,,,,some political turns related tozamidaars after india got independentand some very shocking twists inbefore interval....The directer doesnt have hurry foranything,,,,his execution for the movieis very slow and motwane doesntbother this,,,,he is just concentratedon what he want to show instead ofwhat audience wants to see...

This is indeed a golden period of Bollywood; especially in the genre of depiction of love and fervor.@Anup Finally we agree! @Suman Amazing, innit?@Sammya great times, indeed!meetu - Its not like m always against u,,,,if it would have like that,,i was not prefering ur reviews over others....;-)Very well written indeed... your thoughts seem to be in sync with my own thoughts. The biggest compliment that I can give is that there is nothing "Bollywood-like" about it... Lootera seems to carry the stamp of a quintessential art house product from European cinema. Vikramaditya Motwane and team need to be congratulated for their commendable effort!Please take some time out to check my blog's review of Lootera:http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/2013/07/lootera-2013-indian-filmmaker.htmlVery good film. Loved it. Must watch in theatre.@Anup I know. I was just teasing ;)@Murtuza Thank you ji! Will read your review too.@vg Yep!Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
