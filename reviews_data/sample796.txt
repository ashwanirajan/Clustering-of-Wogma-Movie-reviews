A brain-dead love story. A mind-numbing experience. Something that I won't call the worst I have seen only because I've seen worse. What kind of juvenile writing is this? Boy meets girl after he is engaged to her. They don't want to get married to each other. They play games so that the families go against the marriage. And then, guess what? They want to get married! And no I'm not giving the movie away. There's more in the story. How I wish there was more "to" the story too.

It's one of those cases in which even the characters' motivations are explained, you can't be made to care, because everything is just so outrageous. I mean, how can you take any film that has this scene seriously - there is ominous music when a girl tells her ex she didn't call him when there was a stressful event in her life because she had deleted his number from her mobile! And the accompanying dialogue is atrocious too. 
The performances are just about passable. The makeup is awful. The camerawork is basic and purely functional. The music is .. whatever...
Oh well, the entire film has a more or less regressive "whatever" feel to it. Who are these films made for? Do such films have any takers? Really?

            Yay! Thumbs Up,
            by Prachi
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.@Shashank all sympathy is accepted :DHi meetu, I haven't watched this (and don't intend to), but your write-up made me think how important execution is compared to the plot. If we described Socha Na Tha,  we'd have a similar plot outline to narrate - but that one is such a pleasant film.@Shuchi I haven't seen 'socha na tha' yet. But have heard the premise and a load of good things about it. will try to catch it soon.@Prachi wow! that's cool...didn't think there'd be too many people who liked the film.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
