Cheeni Kum comes across as the perfect recipe for the weekend.  Great performances, great dialogues, hilarious situations, well-defined characters, great visuals…the ingredients are all there.Cheeni Kum comes across as the perfect recipe for the weekend.  Great performances, great dialogues, hilarious situations, well-defined characters, great visuals…the ingredients are all there.
R Balki (Balkrishnan), the debutant director, has done a commendable job, and not since Farhan Akhtar’s Dil Chahta Hai has a first directorial venture come out so impressively. Like Farhan in DCH, Balki has done the story himself and has come up with well-etched out characters. The characterization has been done so well that even cameos like the chef’s crew or medical store-owner impress.
The performances of Amitabh and Tabu are of the highest quality, though Tabu impresses a little more than Big B, and her screen persona at times reminds you of Shabana Azmi. Both lead actors impress with their comical timing (non-slapstick) and their Urdu diction is always spot-on - I wish the irritating journalists of ‘Aaj Tak’ could speak Urdu like this.
The movie also marks the return of music maestro Illaiyaraja, and he has done a tidy job. The mellifluous "Jane do na" number by Shreya Ghoshal has a lilting effect. Singer Vijay Prakash has done Amitabh's playback wonderfully well - thank god there is no Sudesh Bhonsle for a change!
Editing by Chandan Arora is slick and glitch-free.  PC Sreeram’s Cinematography is impressive, and he has captured the locales of both London and Delhi beautifully. The dialogues of Cheeni Kum clearly take the cake, with the sarcastic repartee every now and then being the flavour of the movie.
Remember Ayesha kapoor? The girl who bagged all the awards for her role in Black. Well, she is not there in the movie, but she might have been one of Balki’s inspirations while writing the movie (more on this in the notepad section).
The movie is primarily a comedy, but it is neither devoid of a story, nor is it a palliative for the neurons. And what’s more, it has a message too, which the young at heart would surely love. 
Vis-à-vis other movies of its ilk, Cheeni Kum comfortably scores over Jogger’s Park (though JP had richer & varied music) and Nishabd. Amitabh’s role is cleanly developed and thankfully there are no traces of the gaucherie of Sexy Sam.
All in all, Cheeni Kum is a movie that should certainly be watched. The movie has one or two small sequences (though comical), which may warrant parental discretion, so decide for yourselves if you would like to take your kids along. 
Happy viewing!

        ...Cheeni Kum's biggest asset also turns out to be its biggest liability - Amitabh Bachchan. Make no mistake. The actor is in fine form and delivers yet again but writer-director Balki seems to have forgotten that Bachchan apart, there are other elements too that make up a film in totality - a coherent screenplay for one....

: The performances of Amitabh and Tabu are of the highest quality, though Tabu impresses a little more
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Warning: this section has some details that could distort your experience while watching the movie. I strongly recommend reading this only after you have seen the movie or if you have decided not to see it.Buddhadev (Amitabh) is the 64-year old Chef-cum-owner of Spice 6, a London restaurant. He thinks his restaurant is the only place around that serves authentic Indian cuisine, though for his own dinner he opts for the food cooked by his aged mom (Zohra Sehgal). A customer Nina (Tabu) does not find the preparation of ‘Hyderabadi Zafarani pulao’ authentic, and later demonstates THE proper method of preparing it. Buddha and Nina get to meet frequently thereafter and romance sets in. They decide to get married, but Buddha must break the news to Nina’s cricket-crazy, Gandhian father Om Prakash (Paresh Rawal) first. OP vehemently disapproves of the association, but Buddha, aided by the blessings of his mom and timely advise from his 7-year old confidante Sexy (Swini Khara), manages to trigger a change of heart in OP.Buddhadev (Amitabh) is the 64-year old Chef-cum-owner of Spice 6, a London restaurant.

OP vehemently disapproves of the association, but Buddha, aided by the blessings of his mom and timely advise from his 7-year old confidante Sexy (Swini Khara), manages to trigger a change of heart in OP.The mental struggle of an arrogant Buddha when he has to say “I am sorry” to Nina
The authentic potrayal of a restaurant kitchen (a quantum leap from the one in Manmohan Desai’s Naseeb)
The acerbic sense of humour of Buddha and Nina
The characterization of Sexy, the terminally-ill precocious neighbour of Buddha. Her interactions with Buddha are a laugh riot.
My gut feeling is that the character might have been inspired by the on-stage conduct of Ayeesha Kapoor, the girl who bagged all the awards for her role in Black. Ayesha used to refer to Big B in first person and so does Sexy! And like Ayesha, I think Swini would bag all the film awards next year in the Child Actor category.
The dialogues given to poker-faced waiter Colgate (Krishna Bhatt) take off from where Rajpal Yadav left in Waqt
The movie’s second half actually has  some vital moments shot in India. During the interval I was wondering whether it would be another all West & no India affair (a la Ta Ra Rum Pum), but the Delhi capsule was refreshing
OP’s Gandhian opposition to the Buddha-Nina alliance is so cute, reminds you of a few of Utpal Dutt’s performances in Hrishikesh Mukherjee films
The concern for detail demonstrated by the director in :
Having the protagonists get their urdu diction right. 
Depicting a cancer patient (who is receiving chemotherepy) don a cap all the time

Ayesha used to refer to Big B in first person and so does Sexy! And like Ayesha, I think Swini would bag all the film awards next year in the Child Actor category.The overuse of Qutab’s miracle tower in the climax
The craving for chicken shown by a Gandhian OP
The interest shown by the mohallawallas in OP’s satyagrahaHow come Buddha’s restaurant is vacant when Tabu comes to return his umbrella, even though it is ususally rather crowded ?
Why does Buddha, now settled in London for over twenty years, quote the price of a bouquet of roses as two hundred “rupees”?
Why does Zohra Sehgal on her return from Haridwar choose to listen to her son’s entire tale of woe without disembarking from the train?Yep, I too loved the film, and for most parts worked for me! My review is here:http://www.deepakjeswal.com/cheeni-kum/its not a social film and not suited to be watched with family especially with elders...its not a movie. it's a boring movie yaar. it's a waste of time and money.Wow, Fahd! Where did you get that from!? Tabu a manifestation of Sexy...wow...wouldn't have thought of that in a thousand years!It's one of the best movies I have ever seen.Meetu was right when she recommended this to me - it's an intelligent, enjoyable humorous romantic movie with well-written and played and mainly realistic leads, brilliantly played by Tabu and Amitabh Bachchan. There's an adorable neighbor moppet dying of "blood cancer" who Bachchan's chef/restauranteur befriends - she's just as believable thanks to Swiri Khara's performance (as is so often the case with Indian child actors, I'm amazed at how good they are!). The secondary characters, his mother and her father, might be a bit more cartoonish, but still well-acted by Zohra Sehgal and Paresh Rawal. There aren't any big musical numbers, but in a movie like this they'd be out of place - and what songs there are are well-integrated into the plot. I bought this on DVD because it wasn't available on Netflix - and I'm glad I did.@TimELiebe Yay! I'm so glad you liked it!Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
