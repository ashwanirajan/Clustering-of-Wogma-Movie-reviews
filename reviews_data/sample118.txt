Sultan is one movie repeated twice – once before the interval and once after. Both are equally predictable and melodramatic.The good news is that the film is not your standard Salman Khan film that asks you to leave your brain behind. The not-so-good news is that it is still a predictable, melodramatic affair. The bad news is that the plot repeats itself twice over. It seems like telling it once didn't take it to optimum runtime, so the writers decided to say it all over again. In turn, this one ended up being almost 3 hours long. With nothing new to tell it is interesting that the second half is more engaging than the first. It could have to do with a fresh set of action choreography in terms of the wrestling matches. Despite being a sports film, at its heart Sultan is romantic. But it is very conscious about being romantic. So, a boy woos a girl - twice. Each time, the boy is willing to go to any extent to win her love but of course he is too macho to accept it. Instead he calls it a fight with himself. eyeroll That and dialogue you would find in any coach-prodigy film like, “I see myself in you.” make Sultan even more predictable.The only surprises then, can come from individual situations or performances. Individual situations try hard to seem progressive in the form of the lead lady giving a lecture on a woman's rightful place in this new age. Unfortunately, it cannot hold its own for too long and falls prey to putting the man on a pedestal despite his faults. So be it. Anyway, so is it in real life. With a pinch of salt, we can applaud a Salman Khan film to be close to reality. It also nods its head to reality by acknowledging that it is rife with melodrama. That still doesn't make the melodrama any more tolerable. Interestingly though, the performances do their best in keeping the melodrama at bay. There are no histrionics and minimal hamming from lead actors Salman Khan and Anushka Sharma. Supporting acts by one and all are pretty good too. Though each one of them slips in their accent and it looks particularly unnatural coming from Anushka Sharma. Even so, Sultan doesn't get boring. The music is engaging, the visuals are crisp and fight sequences from the second half arrest your attention while they last. They take the edge off the flat plot, yet not a whole lot.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.The biggie season is being kicked (pun intended) off.The trailer did not do any wonders for me, and I would not be incorrect to say that the trailer even put me off going to watch the film.  The songs too have not yet grown on me after having heard all of them a couple of times.So basically: I am not getting that palpitation feeling expected at the launch of a Salman Khan film.  To the contrary I am getting a mixed feeling that this Sultan is going to lose the fight.  But then, it's early days to write-off a Salman Khan film however mundane the trailer might look.My mind says to wait for the initial word of mouth to come before heading for the theatre, but the (filmi) heart says that buy the first day tickets as soon as they go on sale.  And I know who is going to win in this fight of heart and mind.Music,Cinematography,Locations Screenplay,Editing,Action is "Fabulous". It has beautiful sweet emotional story of a man wins world. Overall Sultan is complete entertainer film. Sultan 1st half is engaging, lots of funny moments, action ,& emotional angle. 2nd half is very predictable but screenplay is tight.Overall its must a watch film after long period of time.Two things.  First is - my opinion of the film. Second is - what I believe will be the public acceptance of the filmFor my appreciation - it is an alright masala film, slightly above average.  Lots of flaws but can be ignored under the cinematic licence granted to Salman Khan. For the public reception of the film - I am convinced that this has B L O C K B U S T E Rwritten all over it.  As we are reminded in the film that in sports nothing sells more than a home team ( or champion) beating the hell out of the visiting team,  so it is in films.  Nothing works more than your home grown hero beating the hell out of the pretenders. I can imagine how the non metro circuits would burst into applause and whistles with each Sultan throw at his opponent.As regards the predicability aspect, I am sufficiently grown up to realise that no where in the world has a sports based film be made where the lead actor/team loses a critical match.Performance wise I found Salman extremely subdued and down to earth.  Welcome change.  Are also missing the one liners usually associated with his recent films.  I did find him old and fat. He should stop playing a 30 year old; doesn't work.  The topless moment is there but not in your Rambo type scene.  Anushka looked a misfit for the role.  The actor who played Govind did impress me.Finally, @Meeta : the film was not repeated twice.  It was repeated once only. :-)Right from the promos to the posters, Sultan was surely never gonna be in the Bodyguard/Kick range, which were more of dumbed down masala entertainers catering to blind Salman fanatics alone. Sultan is in the Bajrangi Bhaijaan range, a movie catering to a completely universal target audience, right from the the gold class audiences of metros to the single screens of towns. MEGA BLOCKBUSTERThe movie has earned 38 cr on day 1. As per trends :if word of mouth is 90%+ : 360-400 crif wom is 80% : 320-360 crif wom is 70% : 280-320 crif wom is 60% : 240-280 crif wom is 50% : 200-240 crEven with a 50% word of mouth the movie would still cross 200 cr. I suppose it would be somewhere around the 70-80% mark which means a 300+ finish. Don't think it can garner as much goodwill as Bajrangi Bhaijaan. Salman however, has once again proved his ability to give record grossers even with negative wom's, like he did with bodyguard and ett. His criminal background and notorious record notwithstanding, he is Hindi cinema's biggest superstar since Amitabh Bachchan. No question about that!The positive wom will be more than 50%.  Plus the spiral success from pan - India will fuel further footfalls.  Add to that a clean family entertainer tag.Commercially i don't see how this one can fail.I love your quick review, didnt feel the need to read the rest of the review... But did anyway. Well writtenInflation adjusted collections for Salman starrers over the last 6 years :Dabangg (2010) : 280-300 crBodyguard (2011) : 210-225 crReady (2011) : 190-200 cr (non holiday)ETT (2012) : 240-250 crDabangg 2 (2012) : 200 crKick (2014) : 240 crBajrangi Bhaijaan (2015) : 335 crLets see how Sultan fares in comparison to these.Salman is back, but some Khans will need controversy to promote their films whereas, some are struggling to release their films.Sultan works and works well, thanks to its unadulterated entertainment that would find favor among the urban and mass audience alike. ALL TIME BLOCKBUSTER. I expect this to surpass PK & Bajrangi Bhaijaan with ease.http://simplebollywoodreviewer.blogspot.in/2016/07/sultan-review-strong-relationship-drama.html#Sultan | The director has worked on the backdrop. Anushka Sharma's training is paying off. It's a long film though. #Sultan | What's a Bollywood film without cliches. This one is also not devoid of them. Salman Khan's superstardom is at work though. From Haryana to London to Delhi, #Sultan travels places. Randeep Hooda's powerful presence ups the thrill quotient. #Sultan | Aditya Chopra's screenplay is the best thing about this film. Freestyle fight choreography is another good thing.@Aparna Thank you! Glad it served the purpose :DSuperb Film.I really loved the film.Music,Cinematography,Screenplay,Editing,Action are "Very Good". Definitely Sultan Is a BLOCKBUSTER MovieI liked watching Sultan movie. Salman Khan, Randeep Hooda are good. And this movie is hard work for the team. Music is also good especially the song Jag ghoomeya.Now we have bogus box office websites well known for fabricating and fudging numbers passing judgements on the so-called television "disasters" like Airlift, Neerja and Kapoor & Sons :http://boxofficeindia.com/report-details.php?articleid=2172The kind of sources are the antithesis for the cozy club of elites & pseudo intellectuals who make icons out of the likes of Anurag Kashyap and Vishal Bharadwaj. Factually, both sides of the spectrum are detrimental to an analysis based on facts and figures. Now someone needs to tell these dimwits at boxofficeindia that television viewership is not restricted to the Star Gold's and Set Max's of the world in today's age. Viewers who watch Airlft or Kapoor & Sons on Tata Sky/Airtel Digital TV would obviously not catch up with them on Star Gold. And there is NO measure of TRP's for films releasing on digital TV. Not even by the bogus fudgers calling themselves "boxofficeindia". I'm quite surprised why no one from within the industry has taken this website to court in the last 13 years since its inception. No wonder even the ever so manipulative Taran Adarsh has more credibility and followers than this joke of a website called "boxofficeindia.com" who claim to be the know it all of Bollywood since the last 6 decades, be it collections or footfalls. What more amusing is that there are viewers who're willing to take their lies at face value!When boi.com released exaggerated figures, a commenter copied and pasted their content, now he is trolling them. Take a stand and maintain it and do not move like those in need of Risperidone.[comment deleted because it is a personal attack]This person who is obsessed with a particular star, keep it up. BOI fan in PK era, BOI enemy in Sultan era. The fact is PK will still thrash all your hero's films.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
