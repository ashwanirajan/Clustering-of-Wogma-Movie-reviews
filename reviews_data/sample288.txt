wogma rating: Add to 'must watch' list (?)
Three characters tell you they are only human. They are all insecure. They are self-destructive when in love. They are directionless. And unfortunately, this last sentence can be said about the film too. While the characters are superbly set-up individually, when woven together they just don't gel. And the standards set by the start leave you feeling high and dry by the time it reaches the finish line.NOT A REVIEW - just wondering what makes atyachar (torture) worth it... So we are flipping channels one evening and a Dev D promo shows up. The flipping stops. Abhay Deol is snorting up something. I get this queer déjà vu that feels like Requiem for a dream. The better half says, "paagal hai ye aadmi!" (This man is mad!) in-sync with director, Anurag Kashyap's name showing up on screen. And he hasn't even seen No Smoking! 
I'd say, "long live such craziness." - The kind that guarantees something 'different' for its audience - whether they like it or not. The brand that even a non-consumer recognizes. 
This time around it's Devdas - a novel written almost a century ago - readjusted to fit or misfit in today's environment. So, the parameters are set and yet the promos convince you that it's not going to be the same. 
I'm not a huge fan of stories with Loser protagonists - especially the ones with a capital L - lead characters who are clueless and spineless. Devdas surely falls into that category. I'm getting over this misgiving, convincing myself it’s the pathos of the losers that makes for movie material. Getting there...gradually. 
Meanwhile, along with the promos, the music has also piqued interest. 18 songs by the man behind the music of Aamir, Amit Trivedi. In combination with the man behind the visuals of No smoking's songs - I'm certainly in for an audio-visual treat. An intelligent musical? Is that even possible? 
Of course, there's loads of talk on the movie at Passion For Cinema - how the story came about, how some of the music originated, two deleted scenes and loads more. The movie making process sounds really haphazard. I guess there are many ways to make a movie - dynamism, keeping an open mind is one of them. The most interesting bit is from Anurag during his temporary bout of depression -

I felt judged and that gave me the idea to what to do with Dev.D. Write a story about the young people who were judged by the society and were given no chance to come back. That is what Dev.D is. It’s the story of the outcasts. People we give up on, because they are stubborn, because they refuse to confirm and they don’t listen. they want to do their own shit, take their time figuring the rights from wrongs and in the process discover themselves. Like i always said, Dev.D is the story of self realization, self discovery , self destruction being one of the routes to it or the result of it.

In general, each movie brings with it excitement and apprehensions. I'm excited about a movie capturing the generation X that finds itself confused between its eastern roots and western sensibilities. I'm really intrigued by the soft porn look the official site is given. Not only is it bold, the entire concept looks like its mocking society's value system and maybe even questioning them. 
But I'm a little uneasy about it being set in Punjab and Delhi. With other films in and about these places, I've felt like I lost an experience because I didn't get it! Very frustrating indeed. 
Anyway, I didn't care much for Anurag's Black Friday but No Smoking was mesmerizing in a very weird sort-of a way. So, right now the series is level. The India-Sri Lanka one though we are all set for a 5-0! Woohoo!!

  As the first few scenes unfold I try to imagine the understandable reaction of an audience that is fed on mainstream Hindi cinema. "Titillating!", "Voyeuristic!!", "Despicable!!!" Maybe audiences that are exposed to cinema from the world will have a similar reaction too. This is not what we do in 'our' movies. So what if almost every movie boasts a pole-dance in the name of 'item number' with the most suggestive lyrics?! Even so, I'd have agreed with them if the characters in Dev D didn't move beyond their basic needs, if they didn't try to understand each other. Or if they didn't have reasonable motivation. Or if they, like normal human beings, didn't move on from one pain to another. It's all there. Not completely satisfying, but it's there.

Not entirely smoothly but you are introduced to the characters. Even though most of us might not identify with them, we begin to enjoy them. The offense to the Indian psyche starts its onslaught with the guy who is adamant and outright disrespectful towards his elders. A girl in love can go to any extent to please her man. Another frustrated, violated, unloved teenager rebels when friends and family desert her. Each one a very strong character. And all three condemn themselves to self-destruction - even if one of them takes a socially acceptable path. 
But, then something goes wrong. The writing in terms of the story just loses its charm mid-way. The strong characters turn limp as if the writers lost interest. Fortunately the dialogue stays crisp and smart. But, all the foreplay doesn't lead to anything exciting. No home-run after third base? 
Tut-tut....It's not our culture to express our sexuality. We have the urge. 1,00,00,00,000 don't happen just like that! But, Shushhh! We purge the need to talk about it. And here you have the three main characters lusting like there's no tomorrow - on the big screen at that!  Scandalous!! But, HOLD ON...It's explicit by implication not by expression. Not so much as a kiss in it for us to make a fuss about. And yet it comes across as imprudent. Sure the language is refreshingly candid. It's not exactly everyday language only because not all people can think on their feet like that. 
And this is what sets Dev D apart. It's almost as if the camera is just waiting for a nudge, to be pushed to capture what might be happening under that bush. But the makers enjoy teasing the audience better. Of course, this also helps in escaping the censor scissor. 
It's an Anurag Kashyap movie. By definition it has to try and show the society a mirror. He comments on the double standards of men and spells it out through dialogue, just in case you were trying to overlook it. The film talks about sex not only as an obsession, but also as a form of possession - this person is mine because he/she makes love with me. It drills the angst down in the songs. Almost constantly, there are words in the background song telling you something insightful if you care to pay attention. Incidentally, it was the first time I saw audience singing a song out loud in a theater. 
How can I leave Abhay Deol's charm or dialogue delivery skills out? O-kay, his smile and dimples too! Yet his character,  Dev's attitude made me want to slap him. Maybe because he portrays Dev's audacity that well, or maybe because Mahie Gill played Paro as if there wasn't any effort involved. I didn't need to understand much of Punjabi to know what was on this girl's mind! Am I the only one who felt like I was watching Tabu? However, the chemistry between Abhay and Mahie is completely missing when Kalki Koechlin and Abhay get together. Kalki didn't seem 100% comfortable and thus looked a little pretentious. 
Dev D represents what some of the urban youth go through today. Their candor, their confidence, their conceit, their sexual desires, their redefinition of true love. It’s a story told and retold over decades, in literature and on screen. But it's more open, more bold. Unfortunately, it also feels like it's half-told.

However, the chemistry between Abhay and Mahie is completely missing when Kalki Koechlin and Abhay get together. Kalki didn't seem 100% comfortable and thus looked a little pretentious. 
Dev D represents what some of the urban youth go through today. Their candor, their confidence, their conceit, their sexual desires, their redefinition of true love. It’s a story told and retold over decades, in literature and on screen. But it's more open, more bold. Unfortunately, it also feels like it's half-told.

It's an Anurag Kashyap movie. By definition it has to try and show the society a mirror. He comments on the double standards of men and spells it out through dialogue, just in case you were trying to overlook it. The film talks about sex not only as an obsession, but also as a form of possession - this person is mine because he/she makes love with me. It drills the angst down in the songs. Almost constantly, there are words in the background song telling you something insightful if you care to pay attention. Incidentally, it was the first time I saw audience singing a song out loud in a theater. How can I leave Abhay Deol's charm or dialogue delivery skills out? O-kay, his smile and dimples too! Yet his character,  Dev's attitude made me want to slap him. Maybe because he portrays Dev's audacity that well, or maybe because Mahie Gill played Paro as if there wasn't any effort involved.

            Yay! Thumbs Up,

            Yay! Thumbs Up,
            by Suman
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Dev (Abhay Deol) and Paro (Mahie Gill) are madly in love with each other. But it doesn't work out. All distraught, Dev takes on to drugs and alcoholism with a vengeance. Along the way, he meets Chanda (Kalki Koechlin), a commercial sex-worker.
What Worked

The way the sexual innuendos are worked into the movie - carrot, cocks, hand pumps, etc.
The tributes to Madhuri Dixit and Devdas.
Paro's dignity and style of self-destruction.
Portraying a prostitute as a savior, a Florence Nightingale.
Chanda' attraction to Dev because he looked like he was in pain. I'm not sure if this was intended by the writers but that's what it came across as. She felt useful as a person not as a body.

What did not
Note: This section simply lists the things that I did not like in this movie. This is not the overall impression about this movie. Please read the full review here

A girl in Bhatinda carries a mattress across town without a brow being raised? Sure she gives some explanation to her parents, but that sounded lame.
Great song - 'emosonal atyachaar'...but why would anyone pay for a song about 'torture caused by love' at a wedding party??
The two women sitting outside Chanda's room. For some reason, they bothered me.
The trio in the 'jalte jalte' song. Looked very out of place.

Nitty-Gritty
This section lists things that I think are not important to the overall impact of the movie. In most cases, it could be explained away by something like, "we noticed the glitch after the scene was shot and there were schedule/budget issues and thus we could not re-shoot it". I like giving the makers the benefit of doubt, but I am amused nevertheless. Hopefully, they will tickle you too.

A girl in Bhatinda carries a mattress across town without a brow being raised? Sure she gives some explanation to her parents, but that sounded lame.
Great song - 'emosonal atyachaar'...but why would anyone pay for a song about 'torture caused by love' at a wedding party??
The two women sitting outside Chanda's room. For some reason, they bothered me.
The trio in the 'jalte jalte' song. Looked very out of place.

Violence: A slap or two
Language: Loads of adult-speak. Abuses and general sex-talk
Nudity & Sexual content: A couple of attempts at love-making. 
Concept: One of the main characters is a clueless, adamant, 'disrespectful'. Not exactly your child's role model. But then again, maybe you were partially like that in your youth too. Another character is a call-girl. And almost, of her own will.

The first time I had watched it, I was blown away. Not because it is a mind blowing story, but because it is shown in such rawness of today's age. Especially when compared to all the other Devdas stories I've heard, which only talk about how grand their houses were and how sad their lead character was. And Abhay Deol's alcoholism seemed so real too, and that was suprisingly very different form Bollywood's typical (cough-SRK-cough.) For that matter his dialogues and acting too, but that's for another discussion. Oh and the music, I have no doubt that half my love for the film came because of Amit Trivedi. It fit so well with all the moods that it sometimes defined the mood. I love this film, even today after watching it many times. New talent always seem like a breath of fresh air, even through a dark film.What do you mean re-post, @intelshwets? The rest of what you said, completely agree!Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
