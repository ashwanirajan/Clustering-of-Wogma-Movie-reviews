Because we live in a world so imperfect, FALTU creates an alternate reality. In which they show us a way to make the world perfect. So what if that route itself is as imperfect as the system it's trying to correct? So, while it is lively and fun, FALTU isn't something that'll stay with you after you've walked out of the theaters. Though I think it wanted you to, what with the strong message it tries to convey masked under all that light-heartedness. Oh yeah, and that one brilliant dance performance in the climax.Do you not shudder at the thought of a choreographer trying his hands at direction? The thought brings back scary 
Memories, doesn't it? But looking at Remo D'Souza as a judge on the dance reality show, Jhalak Dikhla Ja is reassuring. He seemed level-headed and thus there is hope that anything that he does will not to be outright bad. 
So F.A.L.T.U is an autobiographical film, in the sense that a lot of the views on the education system are from the Remo's experiences. And like Remo in his college days actor Jackky Bhagnani is made to do a lot of wild things. How wild? We'll know soon enough. 
Meanwhile, the synopsis doesn't sound very exciting. It goes -
Faltu is a story about a group of friends that are considered a total waste. The cherry on the cake being that they take pride in the fact
... 
However a turn in their life leads them to such a situation where fates of many more like them comes in their hands.
Sounds like a campus comedy, which could be fresh with the right dialogues and situations. The trailer though doesn't give away much and whatever it does have isn't something entirely worth looking forward too, especially the digs on Shah Rukh Khan. I mean, how many more times are we going to see that? 

Not to mention, the lead actor's debut doesn't have any recall value - the very forgettable Kal Kissne Dekha - literally. I can't remember having watched the film even after having re-read my review. And I know, I should feel humiliated having to admit this, embarrassment eludes me. 
If the film is going to boast its cameo list before it mentions its lead actors, should I really be beating myself up about forgetting the latters' earlier films. But this time the actor who also happens to be the producer's son seems to have been very careful about choosing a good script. Don't ask me what will be left in the script for him if each of the cameos are given even two minutes of screen time each. 
Anyway, it takes guts to name your film "Faltu" which translates to useless/good-for-nothing - feeding straight in the hands of reviewers/viewers who don't like the film. And to top it off, the release date is set for April 1. Hopefully the music is a sign of things to come; almost everyone has liked it. I tried downloading from the site, but somehow it didn't work. I'm not sure if my credit card was charged or not. But what the heck, it's only Rs. 40. Yep! Your heard it right, Rs. 40 for the whole album - 11 songs! Here's what some of the people who actually heard them all have to say.

  It is striking how FALTU makes you aware of our climb up the Maslow's need pyramid. Gone are the days of worrying about roti, kapda aur makaanIt will soon be fashionable to make a film about our thoroughly flawed educational system. And isn't it a good thing that we don't expect profound and workable solutions from our films? FALTU doesn't either. But, I do like the basic concept and the way director, Remo has tried to execute it. If only it was a little funnier than it eventually is, with lines, with performances.
There were certainly a couple of hilarious, laugh-out-loud scenes. And there are other times that you might not be able to control your smile at the silliness of the situation. But, when a movie sets out to talk about social issues, it needs to leave a lasting impression by whatever means possible. Humor works at most times, but in this one, it doesn't. Especially, if you give away 2-3 of your main punch jokes in the trailer.
One reason of course, is that not all the supposedly funny lines make you laugh, though the intention is clear. As a side, you also get a few lectures on the "right way" to encourage your kids if they aren't academically bright. Also, though the writing tries hard to make characters behave differently from each other, they do end up without any outstandingly distinguishing factors. 
The other reason glaring in your face is the inadequate and loudish performances. If only FALTU had a little less of an Uday-Chopra look alike. I mean it is ok if one looks like the other, but why do both of them have to have that silly grin on their face. It just doesn't allow me to go beyond that and look at what might be acting. 
Sure Puja Gupta is the only saving grace in this department. Yeah, this despite having both Riteish Deshmukh and Arshad Warsi - two of the best we have in terms of comic timing. Again, I'd put the blame on the superfluous writing. There is just no attention paid to their characters.
Despite all of this though, the basic plot tries its best to remain true to its theme and the spirit of the film. The bunch of controlling parents is no new concept to the way many of us might have grown up. To see it on screen gives us a sense of camaraderie even. You can hear an entire generation shouting "LET GO!" when a son says that to a father. 
AND there's that last dance in the climax (no, not the closing credits, the one that is a part of the actual film). I could watch it over and over again and bumped up the rating a bit just for that one last masterpiece.

          If u've watched "Accepted" avoid FALTU. Truly a useless copy of the Hollywood version which has nothing new.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Four good-for-nothings manage to land themselves responsible for 300 other good-for-nothings. And then set out to make use out of this wasteFour good-for-nothings manage to land themselves responsible for 300 other good-for-nothings. And then set out to make use out of this waste
The picturisation of the line "jahaan jail ho gaya", simply brilliant!
The coinage "over-educated"
The way the SRK-arm-spread is incorporated in the dance in the climax.

How did 300 people find the website? If only websites were so easy to make and bring up on search engines! They touched the wrong nerve here :D
Inspired by: Acceptedso wiki says its a remake of an English movie Accepted, which was quite funny. I hope the Hindi version is not just a 3 hour extended version of the same!The film, from the trailers, looks like a rip-off of the Hollywood flick 'Accepted'@ligne @dfuser that's what i've read too. haven't seen the movie yet, might try to catch it before watching F.A.L.T.U@Simy you aren't really looking forward to this one, are ya?This movie is just a re launch for Jacky Bhagani...and the plot (and the trailer seems too similar to the Justin Long starrer Accepted)FALTU stands for Fakirchand and Lakirchand Trust University.in Accepted S.H.I.T stood for South Harmon Institute of TechnologyThis movie is just a re launch for Jacky BhaganiCopyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
