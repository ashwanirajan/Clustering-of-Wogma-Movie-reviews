Same ol' senseless slapping about, fooling around and basically random running all over the place. The regular elements of a typical slapstick coexist and as always, don't entertain.Sometime earlier this week, a friend suggested that all I'd need to do for the review of All the Best is to copy-paste the review of Golmaal Returns. I laughed it off then. On Diwali-eve, I'm so tempted to use that suggestion as really well-meaning and useful advice. But, non-plagiarizers that we are, here you go. (And if don't care for the details, the rating says it all. Golmaal Returns is not recommended and neither is All The Best.)

There are these two buffoons who are the creative types, so they obviously can't earn for themselves - Prem, Prem Chopra (Ajay Devgan) and Veer (Fardeen Khan). But they have expensive tastes and style of living. So, of course they beg, borrow, AND steal. And lie, lie to cover that lie and so on. And of course, a successful business tycoon, more gullible than the average nincompoop, Dharam (Sanjay Dutt) completes the circle. 
Yeah, that's the kind of "plot" we are looking at. (Of course, you can choose not to look at it, I didn't.) Add to it the endless stream of caricatured characters who add to the commotion. But, there is this razor-thin silver lining to this dark cloud - there are a few good one liners every once in a while. And they are delivered pretty subtly, especially in comparison to the rest of the movie. The understated tone in which the lines just come make them funnier too. But they are only few and not worth spending those extra calories you've put on this festive season. Enjoy the extra weight, seriously. 
Nothing else is subtle about the rest of the show though. The acting is loud and the background music is louder. And when that's deemed "not enough" there is this shriek-track played in addition to the background score. Supposedly to make us laugh or NOT! 
There isn't anything stylish or cool or worth-watching about the actors' appearances either. The women are wearing the lousiest of outfits and are made up way too much. The men are in their usual slapsticky mode, cracking a few toilet jokes, a few innuendoes and the occasional witty line. So mundane is that there is no amount of oomph their presence could add. Not that they are the best lookers in the industry anyway. 
A lot of older films are referred to. Maybe they are supposed to be tributes. But looked more like insults both in the way they were used AND because the film that's paying a tribute also needs to be of a certain basic quality to consider itself worthy of paying that tribute, right? 
There is this slight comment on undying friendship and the extent to which the best of friends can go to save each others' skin. And there are a couple very sweet moments between Ajay Devgan and his screen partner Bipasha Basu. The fact that they worked for me despite coming towards the end of a tiring film, means all the contributors to those shots did their job really well. If only there were more of those.
Yes, guys, go watch that diya burn. Your Diwali will be happier by avoiding this one.

So ok. This one doesn't leave you... er blue in the face. The comedy is purely situational and the style purely 'Rohit Shetty'. That means a bit of slapstick, a bit of that rapidly-moving tongue in the cheek, and a lot of Ajay Devgn.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Dharam (Sanjay Dutt) and Veer (Fardeen Khan) are brothers. One is an extremely successful businessman and the other is a wannabe musician. Veer has a friend Prem (Ajay Devgan) who is living off him. They have to lie to get money out of Dharam. Of course, they end up in a muddle.Dharam (Sanjay Dutt) and Veer (Fardeen Khan) are brothers. One is an extremely successful businessman and the other is a wannabe musician.

The hospital sequence between Ajay Devgan and Bipasha Basu - totally unexpected.

All the logical goof-ups that Dharam doesn't catch.
The climax - yuck! I mean some serious yuck!!
B. H. Harsh - treat for family? really? Somehow the innuendos and the whole theme of exchanged partners didn't entertain me. THe other reviews are out, they are reviewed by my guest reviewers.Thanks and Happy Diwali!!!Hello from Russia!Can I quote a post in your blog with the link to you?@B H Harsh you got that right. i really dont understand the entire genre. Also the thing is in this genre the gags are getting repetitive...@Pondy yeah. the status to writing in mainstream Hindi films makes me cry sometimes...out of pain and frustration@polprav sure!@Ashok andho mein kaana raja types?@PG Thank you!

Parental Guidance:


Violence: A couple of fights and action sequences
Language: A few innuendoes.
Nudity & Sexual content: Skimpily clad women.
Concept: Friendship and the lies friends tell for each other :)
General Look and Feel: Crisp and bright but I still wouldn't take the kids out for this one. Uhh…or recommend that the parent/guardian go either.
