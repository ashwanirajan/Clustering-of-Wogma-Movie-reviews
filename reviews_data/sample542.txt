
wogma rating: Add to 'must watch' list (?)
A lesson from history told with complete focus on patriotism. The sole aim is to display the conviction of our freedom fighters. Even though it doesn't have any other emotional connect, it is a lesson we shouldn't miss. Chittagong has been in production for quite a while now. And Ashutosh Gowariker's Khele Hum Jee Jaan Se came and went. With a more, if I may say so, 'serious' team at work here, hopefully we will see a lot more in terms of deeper characterization and flair in narration. That one made you feel too, but it was solely due to the story they wanted to narrate, a story that was already written.I hope Chittagong will do more than that and engage us with the film-making departments too. I am hoping for a little more than a history lesson, a little more than episode after episode sewed together. What is most intriguing about Chittagong is the focus on this one student who seems to be in the center of the film.They have at their disposal an awesome cast. The lead actors that are soon becoming usual suspects in Anurag Kashyap films - Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Raj Kumar Yadav, Manoj Bajpai. Certainly worth looking forward to just because of these names.

  Any story that tells us more about our freedom struggle inspires me. On that count, just by choosing to make a film based on an event from those times puts it in the positive column. And it's not that Chittagong doesn't add to the experience through the use of other aspects of film-making, it surely does in every field, from acting to cinematography to direction. Yet, that something more is missing as was in Khele Hum Jee Jaan Se, the connect with the individual characters. There is so little you know about the personalities of the characters that Manoj Bajpai, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Raj Kumar Yadav. Jaideep Ahlawat, Vega Tamotia play that you can barely appreciate their performances. The only character whose life is given a little more detail is that of Subodh Roy aka Jhunku played by young Delzad Hiwale (instantly recognizable as the little brother from this Reliance ad). Jhunku is a self-doubting, torn-between-two-ideolgies lad and Delnaz plays out his confusion really well.It is possible that there is only too little information about the characters available that can be converted to interesting filmable material. Maybe there is so much reverence for the characters that it is difficult to connect with them. They are high on a pedestal and their addiction to their own conviction is so beyond our understanding that any attempt to identify with them just feels inappropriate. And of course, the story is about them collectively, and not about the individuals and their dynamics.  Be that as it may, it is a story that we need to know. Be it Chittagong or Khele Hum Jee Jaan Se this is one chapter from our history that we ought to be aware of. Chittagong is crisper because it is shorter by over half an hour, doesn't delve much into Surya Sen's private life and neither does it have a 'top' actress to sing songs to us. On the other hand, it doesn't have the 'star' power in the traditional sense of the word, though each member of Chittagong's cast is a star in his own right. Yet, they both narrate the story almost similarly. Take your pick, but pick you must.
