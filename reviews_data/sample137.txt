It is an amazingly mature film. Who would have thought that could be said about a 100% family drama?Anything with Alia Bhatt intrinsically seems like it brings a breath of freshness with it. And then you have the stunning makeover for Rishi Kapoor. Off late, he hasn't disappointed with his performances and the rest of the cast looks like they are one with their characters too. Beyond that thought, the trailer becomes a combination of any ol' love triangle and family drama that you might have seen in real life. The heavy promotion on social media goes with the 'young' feeling the film has. But, beyond that it has a Yeh Dillagi feel to it – two brothers fall for the same woman. However, there is an angle of brothers fighting over her rather than sacrificing with each other – which a pleasant (because it seems more real) contemporary air about it. The music too sounds modern. However, doesn't feel like it will overstay a one-time listen. Let's hope it goes better with the film and adds to the experience. Music Reviews:
Bollywood Hungama – "3.5/5" 
Firstpost - "ditch this album, and listen to the original versions of the only two decent songs" 
Milliblog - "highly listenable multi-composer soundtrack!" 
Music Aloud - "7/10"

  A close-up of an old couple holding hands – there are few moments that are as heartwarming as that. Kapoor & Sons is full of these. This in the midst of a good old family drama. Yeah, who would have thought a through and through drama plot-line could be likable. That too with its share of sexual innuendos and toilet humor. Kapoor & Sons is as good as any example of - if the “how” the story is told is done right, the “what” becomes secondary.Drama without dramatics – it has been so long since we have seen this that by itself it is refreshing. The first half of the film barely has any background music. And when things starts heating up in the second half, there is only a slight hint. That itself cuts the drama off to a great extent – keeping background music in its place. The “how” then is peppered with situations and a mix of snappy, funny, profound dialogue that fit the characters, the story, the milieu. In the end then, when you find yourself engrossed with the Kapoor family's problems – and not only because you identify with them – you are taken by surprise with how sentimental the film has managed to make you.Yes, you will see in the Kapoor family either your family or a family that you have been closely associated with. You will know why they feel better knit than a family that pushes things under the carpet. How their relationships are shattered by disclosures and how they, like any family, come together in difficult times – despite their differences, despite their personal anger towards the other. You relate to Kapoor & Sons also also because of its flawed characters and their portrayal by each one of the actors. The atypical dadu by Rishi Kapoor is more charming than both Rahul (Fawad Khan) and Arjun (Siddharth Malhotra). The two young actors themselves though play their own way of hiding or showing their inadequacies. You don't doubt it when other characters call Fawad Khan perfect or simple. Siddharth Malhotra slips up in a scene where he is angry but more than covers up for that in other instances, especially the one scene where he is dumbfounded. It is stunning how Alia Bhatt makes - being cool, sensitive, being both at the giving and receiving end of sympathy – look so easy. Rajat Kapoor and Ratna Pathak Shah play the disagreeable, frustrated couple/parents for you to think of real people they remind you of. And that is something Kapoor & Sons gets so right. When things get too real and serious, they edit smoothly into something that is bound to make you smile, if not laugh. This won't happen in real life, but hey – would they be stories if they reflected real life? The right balance between filmy and real is what makes Kapoor & Sons adorable despite its segue into borderline crass humor or even borderline melodrama. Of course, it is a tear jerker, like any family drama worth its salt ought to be. It is not about who gets the girl, or which sibling wins parent approval. It is also not about whether dadu lives or dies before he gets the family photograph clicked. “It's all about loving your family.”

            by Suman
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Director Shakun Bhatra’s Kapoor & Sons is a story about two brothers who returns to their home in the picturesque hills of Coonoor in Tamil Nadu to see their ailing grandfather. This is a family drama that every filmmaker in India should take cues from. The film does without the flow of glycerin and melodrama that one can easily associate with such films made in India, but touches your heart at the same time.Huh, Meeta - sounds worth watching, and not in our usual "Songs&Dances;&'Splosions!" way.Of course, I'm still trying to get my wife Tammy past Amitabh Bachchan grousing about his bowel movements in PIKU, so this may be a similar uphill climb. :oDirection: 3.5Story: 2.5Lead Actors: 3.5Character Artists: 2.5Dialogues: 2.5Screenplay: 3Music Director: 1Lyrics: 1Seems like the editor of this website is lame enough to delete any messages providing links to external websites these days. Anyhow, Kapoor & Sons is a mature family drama that's neither melodramatic like most of the Barjatya/Johar nonsense and nor mushy/silly/bratty like the Zoya Akhtar brand of cinema 3.5/5@TimELiebe ouch you didn't like Piku?@Anuj Yes, as a policy we delete comments that have only a single external link. A constructive comment that discusses films followed by a link is not a problem. Comment section is a place for discussion not a marketing tool for other websites. :)@Suman So, you liked the movie but wish the story was better?@Meeta - oh, no, Tammy's the only one of us who didn't like Piku! The rest of us really enjoyed it a great deal....Tammy - well, she can't get past Amitabh Bachchan, who she adores (he'll probably crop up as a god in one of her future books ;) ), playing a cranky old coot who mutters about his bowels so much.@TimELiebe :DMagnificent film.   Beautifully treated story. From the word go the film grips you. You feel for every character.  And despite the flaws bordering on the shades of grey of each human, you still understand each one and sympathise for each one. Truly the sign of brilliant story telling on celluloid. Finally, full marks to the makeup person of Rishi Kapoor.  The get up is good, if only Rishi Kapoor would have acted and spoken as a 90 year old.@Fan :D Well, this 90-year old had a mind of his own!Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
