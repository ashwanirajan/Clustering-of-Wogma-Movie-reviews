Jayantabhai ki Love Story doesn't have enough bhaigiri nor enough love. It doesn't engage, nor does it entertain. So, who is looking forward to Vivek Oberoi's next film? What, no one? Oh come on, the man is coming back after ages. Still, no one? Oh well, who am I kidding, I'm one of them too. It doesn't help then that a love story with the lead actor as an underworld, Mumbai goon is too reminiscent of Munnabhai and anything that is anywhere close to that series, is going to seem wannabe, even if it didn't have Vivek Oberoi.Let's just hope, there will be some humor that will make the experience worth it. Other than that, there truly is nothing to look forward to. Yes, yet, I shall watch. I take it as a part of the job description. Music Reviews:
Bollyspice - "3/5"
dunkdaft - "It has all that enjoyable candy-floss, that looks good, doesn't leave lasting impression though. "
Milliblog - "A likeable soundtrack, with competent choice of singers and tunes!"

  Jayantabhai Ki Love Story showed very little potential from it's trailers. So, despite all my needs of wanting to watch every film with neutrality, I went in expecting very little, if at all. The best I can say, is that I came out unscathed because of almost zero expectations. The 'bhaigiri' end of Jayantabhai Ki Love Story is unethusiastic and the love story end is stagnant. The film is pretty much flat throughout, except for a little ruffle in the feathers in the name of a climax.So, plain is the love story, that even after Jayanta (Vivek Oberoi) and Simran (Neha Sharma) take the 'big step' as a couple, they go back to their old relationship soon enough. Tiffs vanish and all becomes well, all too soon. Similarly, the underworld track of the film gathers no momentum at all. The conflict that they start doesn't see much change. Both patronage and animosity are superficial. You never figure why one is loyal to another or why they are at another person's throat. It is said so, and thus it should be believed. And the two tracks have very little do with each other. Whatever little intersection exists, is lame enough to be ignored. The rest is filled with slime-balls in the corporate world who seemed to be worse than infamous casting couches or with formulaic songs shot at exotic locations or gratuitous show of cleavage or other such inanity. Amidst the limp stories then, the smart-Aleckry in the dialogue brings in a laugh or two. You can also scoff at the Munnabhai references. Also, because everything else is so devoid of energy, the over-eager performances make you applaud their attempt at putting life into the characters. It is amazing then, that there are producers who willingly go through with such projects. What in Jayantabhai Ki Love Story wasn't told already and which frame had something that wasn't told in a better way elsewhere? You wonder, and only wonder.

            Not Interested in Watching,
            by Rajat

            Yay! Thumbs Up,
            by eshaan singhal
: 99
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review."the man is coming back after ages."Not really. He did 'Kismat, Love, Paisa, Dilli' recently. But I'm not surprised that people have already forgotten that movie.Oh yeah @Swapnil, the last film I reviewed was Rakhtcharitra in 2010. Oops...Gotta feel for this guy though.A man whose given power packed,hard hitting performances in films like COmpany,Shootout..,Rakht Charitra and Kurbaan definitely deserved a better deal.Am looking forward to watching him in Krish-3 though!@Anuj wow! Really? For me they are all repetitive.They're repetitive 'coz they're all similar roles.But the point is that he does excel in those kinda roles(if supported by a good script and handled by a good director).@Anuj Hmmm...I think an actor needs to be appealing in as many types of roles as possible, right? One thingi love the movie.may roj ak ber is file ko dhakta hu.what ever it takes i like this movie this movie is one of my best movies a big thumbsup for this movie.climax is osem and too emotional but at the end everything settles.@Meetu, I think if you're judging an actor, then yes, versatility is important, but if you're judging a performance, then "what else" the actor is good at shouldn't matter at all.@Rajat True. Very interesting way of putting it.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com. All rights reserved.(Credits: wogma logo by Ain Digytal Inc. wogma audio review signature tune by Shreyas Beltangdy.

Parental Guidance:


Violence: A few fights and gun shots.
Language: Every once in a while a curse word is mentioned half way.
Nudity & Sexual content: A skimpily clad Neha Sharma with occasional show of cleavage and a bare-torso Vivek Oberoi. One love-making scene and a couple of kisses. 
Concept: A failing goon falls in love.
