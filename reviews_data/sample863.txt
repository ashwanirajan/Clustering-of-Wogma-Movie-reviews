It's awesome that a film with a non-glam lady actor in the lead was produced. It brings greater joy that the story is about an everyday girl and she doesn't have some high profile job or boyfriend/husband. Alas, all of this becomes "blah" before you know it. What could have been a celebration of all things woman might just make all women turning 30 into a laughing stock. This is a country where the first attack of arthritis symbolizes aging. We dismissed my mom's menopause as random irritability. Making a big deal out of 'turning 30' is considered, at best, much ado about nothing. That does not make the problems facing the chic-urban-turning-30 any less important. Yes, they have it all, and they want more. And proudly so; even if they have to fight for it. In that sense Turning 30!!! could have been a very important film. But it turns out to be a drab narrative. You wait for the spark and you are kept waiting.

I consider myself a part of the target audience, I'm city-bred, so what if I turned 30 a little while ago. I might not be as chic as her, but I have more than a friend or two who are like the women Turning 30!!! talks about. Yet Naina (Gul Panag) and her friends don't even remotely touch me. I'd have wanted to smile with their jokes, nod at their insights about love, life and everything that goes with it. I'd have loved to cry with them too, but I cringed after the first couple of times I saw Gul cry. There's only so much of a grown-up woman you can see crying, after all. 
The much talked about, and rightly so, Sex and The City hangover is as dreary and superficially profound as the original (go ahead, shoot me for killing your stereotype about all women liking SATC!) And yet, it wouldn't have been such a bore if it weren't so repetitive. 
Fortunately, the writer/director is very open about showing a woman's sexual urges. Hindi films have after all, always been too shy to express sensuality. That her lust goes hand-in-hand with how desperate her love gets is a slice-of-life for any woman in love - age no bar. I also liked the hand homosexuality is dealt. Right from how close friends initially react to their lesbian friend coming out to them to how the larger group reacts to how everyone comes to terms with it. 
Naina's struggle at work too is something that kept me going. It felt like the writer had some insight into a woman's aspirations at work; her frustrations with the macho men in her industry; and her struggle in getting what is rightfully hers. But, that too goes bust with a sorrily written climax. 
That's the story of the film's life. There were many things going right, but sooner or later, they go flat. 
Like a woman who's in her 60s is likely to say, celebrating or whining about a 30th is a thing-to-do by women who have it all and know nothing of real suffering and pain at the hands of their men. And this pain is physical versus the 'literal pain in the ass that her ex-boyfriend was', Naina is heard complaining about. But, that's for the 60-year old to say. We 30-Pluses had our chance and blew it.

XzanderCage:
          Watched turning 30 .... Yesterday  ...  The movie was good ... But the second half was a bit too long to handle ....
        
Vishalanam:
          Turning 30.. Too realistic to be just a movie and yet with Happy Ending. I liked it.. Go watch...
        
vipulsatya:
          Turning 30 is a brilliant movie. A must watch. Worth every second. Simple subtle and brilliant acting by @gulpanag :) #10on10

thebongbabe:
          My take on Turning 30: Sexy, witty, smart and true to life!
        
sujayray:
          Best scene of Turning 30 was when @gulpanag was driving the RE Thunderbird, and best dialogue when Purab said "I can sink into her dimples"
        
sonaliranade:
          http://tinyurl.com/67sqdrl  There are few movies made for urban working women.  @gulpanag identifies us as nobody can. Go see the movie!!
        
ShutterCrazy:
          I did like #Turning 30. All the actors were great! Very real, didn't revolve around a hero! But I don't think 1/2

ravikapoor:
          Turning 30: It's about today's urban woman, her struggles & how she overcomes 'em. Absolutely loved @gulpanag's slapstick humor! #pass

piyal_mukherjee:
          Watched Gul Panag's rebounds on 'Turning 30' - Agree tht its more of a Chick Flick, but I personally liked the movie... Good one!

pallavikaa:
          My take on 'Turning 30': Not my type of movie but certainly recommended for Gul Panag fans, myself included. her career best: Dor, Manorama.

          Turning 30 review: It has its moments but misses the mark: Despite this some people dread aging or in this case,... http://bit.ly/hX3elW

IamDeepikaRM:
          "@MissMalini: @Purab_Kohli I loved Turning 30!" Me too.. But I felt purab was very under used.. Looked sooper hot though!!!
        
HindiPoet:
          Turning 30 is awesome Movie .. a must watch .. GUL is best at act :)  @gulpanag
        
hifiab:
          turning 30, a classical act, made 4 classes, but will fail to deliver commercially
        
awtaney:
          Turning 30: realistic screenplay.
        
arpanak10:
          Turning 30! is a good movie to watch :-)
        
anandpar:
          Turning 30... A tad pretentious maybe, but eminently watchable...
        
Amit_J:
          Turning 30 is a wonderful movie... It's a must watch #movie.

aakanshasethi:

shadanmd:
          Turning 30 is a decent movie..but didnt excite me much..as i hve already dealth with d idea at extent long back..bt the mvie will hve takers
        
PillaiMK:
          Somewhere down the second half, the script does slip into cliches and the phobia of turning 30 gets a bit exaggerated.
        
neenzin:
          Turning 30, poorly directed yet fun to watch! Loosely tries to adapt the carrie-big relationship.
        
vodkaholic:
          While the world goes gaga over Golden Globes, here's my review of Turning 30: Terribly disappointing. Second half was better. Purab is HAWT.
        
vishalmundra04:
          Huh...turning 30 seems to be a disaster...some cheap humor...all in all waste of time.
        
vidya83:
          If you cringe every time someone cries in a film, it must be bad. #Turning 30
        
veryvitriolic:
          Turning 30 is a monumental disaster. The definitive proof that being a stud girl on twitter doesn't add up to shit
        
tishya_khillare:
          Turning 30 was all bout Gul Panag and her clinging on to Rishabh. What an #EpicFail portrayal of an independent thinking Indian woman.
        
SudhishKamath:
          Turning 30: The writing! Fuck. The writing! Never thought a day would come when I would call Aisha a classic. Feel really bad for Gul 3.5/10
        
spotlessmind27:
          am really really sorry @gulpanag ...expected loads out out turning 30, super let down :(
        
sauravbhanot:
          Turning 30 was very bad ! Hated it!
        
saurabhtyagi:
          [email protected] B grade Indian version of SATC..full of clitches abt urban Indian single woman..the intention was rite but the execution sucks!
        
price4u2:
          Turning 30!!! is a chick-flick that lacks fun: is a women-centric flick that takes inspiration from the 'Bridget... http://bit.ly/fygynM

nishioswal:
          Turning 30...Prakash Jha, after making some critically acclaimed n award winning films, something filthy like this is just unacceptable..
        
nabilazaidi:
          Bollywood should take my advice rather seriously - GIVE UP ON CHICK FLICKS... U CAN NOT MAKE EM! Aisha! Turning 30! #wtf
        
mugdhakalra:
          Saw one of the worst films ever 'turning 30'. What a disaster!!!

          Turning 30 gets 2 mirchi at #Mirchiplex meter http://bit.ly/f9kE3D

kranium256:
          Turning 30 IS THE SADDEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!! AARRRGGGHHH!! It's got inconsistent acting and a whole bunch of things gone wrong. Argh.
        
iprasadpatkar:
          Trust me Turning 30 isn't as astoundingly painful as the film
        
Bhadauriya18:
          Turning 30 must be a nightmare. But I'm sure it isn't as agonizingly painful as the film.
        
annavetticad:
          My revw of Turning 30. Sad to say 'tis a silly film! http://annavetticadgoes2themovies.blogspot.com/

aneebunee:
          Saw Turning 30. Went in with no expectations & still came out disappointed. Story was ok. What happened with the dialogues, styling, acting?
