Makes you feel empowered, even though you can see their solutions are way too simplistic.I can see Ungli pulling on urban chords just with the angst against rickshaw drivers. But, beyond that, the rest of the trailer seems same old fight against corruption and the system in general that we've seen in umpteen number of films, especially in recent times.Bold film titles with sexual/offensive connotations also have become run-of-the-mill now, with likes of Happy Ending and Grand Masti to get one excited and/or curious about a film. The cast by itself is exciting after some of the films in recent times, we have seen Randeep Hooda and Kangna Ranaut in. Unfortunately, though they don't seem to be doing anything ground-breaking here. It all boils down to how many tricks Ungli can pull out of the hat that we haven't seen before. Or at the very least show us a new facet on how it can be told. Totally neutral about this one. Which also means, all set to be swung over in the right direction.Music Reviews:
Milliblog - "Gulraj Singh and Salim Sulaiman help raise and show this Ungli." 
Music Aloud - "7.5/10"

  "Common man and his angst" I don't think this topic is getting old in India any time soon. Especially, if there are new ideas, how much ever impractical they might be. And new, easily palatable solutions, which even more easily invoke activism is exactly what Ungli offers.The impressive thing about the writing is that it not only picks topics that you and I encounter on a day-to-day basis and provide its own style of solution. It goes a little beyond. It creates an intriguing character and gives the character a dilemma - a real dilemma that you can see him fighting within. That doesn't take away from the fact that the "ungli activism" episodes themselves are pretty well thought out. I especially enjoyed the rickshaw episode. No, not because it is closer to heart. Maybe a little because they picked an issue that involved civic sense. Maybe a little more because it was not against the usual suspects - politicians/law enforcement. Even a little more because they dared to point a finger at the not-so-rich class. But, the most because of the point in the story that it is done. And how, these facts - that the target is not the typical ones and not rich creates unforeseen complications. Also this triggers a change in the dynamics of the relationships between other characters.Such slight detail in writing is so rare in Hindi films, especially the mainstream films that I take delight in them. It comes as an icing on the cake, when the performances are mostly restrained and there's no melodrama. Of course, the whole "angst" bit does come across as dramatic at some points. But then again, I can see myself getting worked up as much, when I see a car halting in the middle of the road to drop someone off. Here, the issues were larger and the reasons too. Randeep Hooda, Emraan Hashmi, Angad Bedi and Neil Bhopalam all play their bits well and actually look like real people in the real world. Maybe that self-referencing line by Emraan Hashmi could've been avoided because it just reminds you of the actor rather than keep him character.On the other hand, I liked the fact that Neha Dhupia and Kangna Ranaut who came into the industry banking heavily or used heavily for their oomph-factor, are now slowly taking on non-glam avatars. Just that neither of them wore anything blingy was good enough too. I guess it was too  much to ask the makers to avoid an item number. Shraddha Kapoor trying to make a some point with her appearance as a bar dancer. An item number that doesn't even have her lip-sync one line properly while the man in the song does the honors. These things in the beginning of the film make you a little wary of what's to come. But as the movie proceeds, such annoying bits are kept at bay and you settle in. And you actually get involved. An engaging film Ungli is. But like observed in another film not too long ago, "Human behavior and life doesn't change in 3 hours."

          Also saw Ungli. Its less Hashmi & more Hooda. Not sure how Dharma has added value. Nothing like a Dharma film. Decent watch. Not great.
        
MrCoffeekhor:
          #Ungli movie! The positive about it that was it stayed to its name. Ungli word was uttered many times in the movie. Rest, okay'ish flick.
        
kneekeytha:
          #Ungli one time watch
        
gourabkundu:
          Just watched #Ungli - another of those 'could hv beens' decent flow but.
        
snaidu666:
          #ungli has a storyline which the south has been hamming on since the past decade, its like converting a masala dosa into a paneer dosa
        
shivam_mah90:
          #Ungli has been watched....a sheer disappointment.
        
rozelle_l:
          Please don't miss #Ungli. Please watch it, please coz I am so much jealous of those who saved themselves of this [email protected]

ronakgpatel:
          #Ungli.. Fictitious movie on realistic issues. The director has taken the IQ of the audience for granted!
        
rajivvijayakar:
          Opportunity for a quasi-masterpiece let down by (very) bad writing, dialogues & music - #Ungli http://www.indiawest.com/entertainment/bollywood/movie_reviews/ungli-movie-review-far-fetched-fairy-tale-of-quick-fix/article_d5be72d8-7731-11e4-b8b2-1bf2c247a63d.html

pankito09:
          #Ungli could have been a more wittier and smart take on the common mans issues. Rather it played out as a limp and over simplified drawl!
        
narayan_mj:
          UNGLI movie Nice concept but all went in vain due to poor narration & Characters
        
mallik0425:
          #ungli is a pathetic vigilante film which neithr explores theme wth seriousness nor sarcastic comedy genre.1 more filthy scrpt writin effort
        
Legend_Khan1:
          Watched Ungli, Good performances by all but execution of the story was pretty bad. Meh, I didn't really enjoy it 2/5
        
keetuda:
          Ungli is stupid audience's A Wednesday!
        
BongFromBombay:

BeingBihari:
          UNGLI bokwaas movie hai.
        
aryansingh163:

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.The Concept of the movie is novel ,, but the movie is not breathtaking.....But never the less ,,is still better then unnecessary remake who knock every Friday to  make us fool.....Randeep Hooda has not been kept as a side kick ,, which i liked a lot as the trailer showed that Emraan Will be the main lead....As much of acting i only find Randeep to be interesting....About sanjay Dutt he was totally over the top , with lots and lots of bad dialogue ,, its like all the bad dialogues have been given to Sanjay only..... I cant even differentiate when Sanjay plays a cop and when he plays a Criminal ,, because he acts same in both cases.....Star of the movie was great ,, and upto interval it was all good.....But after interval when everything become personal to our Ungli gang it became little uninteresting upto when a nice climax came.......Still its good and also it could have been better....I am surprised to find such a positive review.  I was expecting a thrashing from you ;-)And I am even more surprised to read your advice on Parental Guidance:Nudity & Sexual content: None.Did not expect this on an Emraan Hashmi film.  I guess there is always the first time.@Fan - Even i was shocked by seeing such a high rating by meetu for UNGLI....Although i personally find the movie a easy watch,,,,Watch When On Tv would have been the correct rating.......Infect Meetu is among the few reviewers who have given highest ratings to UNGLIDirection: 2.5    Story: 3    Lead Actors: 3    Character Artists: 2.5    Dialogues: 2.5    Screenplay: 2    Music Director: 1.5    Lyrics: 1.5Yet another November disaster capping off the most most disastrous month in recent times. Emraan Hashmi's all set to have his 5th consecutive flop.@Fan @Anup it is  what it is :P@Anuj So be it. @Suman for a change, story had something going for it, right?Watched it finally. Interesting concept. Rickshaw episode gets my full empathy. Expected a great climax but was sorely disappointed to watch the dumbest climax for this sort of  film.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
