Why should Hollywood have all the fun? Even India and Pakistan can save the world. Especially since Tiger is alive. The regular action fare – nothing more than you expect but nothing less either. The same ol’ collaboration between the intelligence bureaus of India and Pakistan. The same ol’ attempt at bringing the two nations towards each other. The same romance. From the trailer, it looks like Tiger Zinda Hai is only trying to cash in on the Salmania with as little effort in story-writing as is possible.Just about everything is centered around making Salman Khan look cool. That 25 Indian nurses need to rescued is incidental. It is Salman who is rescuing them and that is all that matters. They haven’t even bothered to give him a signature line, let alone decent dialogue. The two voiceover lines and the single line that we see him mouth in the trailer – are all blatantly lame. You almost feel bad for Salman Khan trying to infuse them with meaning and/or energy.Trying my best to find something to look forward to this Christmas. And failing. Tiger Zinda Hai releases on 22 December, 2017.Music Reviews:

  You don’t expect subtlety and you don’t get it. There is no humility here, Tiger Zinda Hai is about how Tiger aka Salman Khan attempts to save hostages, kill villains, love his family all while he patches up the relationship between India and Pakistan to promote world peace. When you go in wanting that, you walk out smiling because you knew exactly what was going to happen. In that sense, Tiger Zinda Hai is satisfying. Else, it is pretty much mundane.Salman Khan is himself and the rest are just props around him, including Katrina Kaif. Sure, she gets to throw a few kicks around and is quite slick about it too. But, ultimately Tiger Zinda Hai wears the Salman card so much on its sleeve that you don’t even want to spend energy in thinking, “Hey but, how did that happen?”In fact, the most apparent show of cashing in on Salmania is that he is given some of the lamest lines ever. It is like the writers know that it doesn’t matter what he says, as long as he has the quintessential swagger about it - almost willingly mocking the fans. Especially when the lyricist has come up with decent lines like, “narazgi kagzi teri”1 or “Swag se karenge sabka swagat”2, you wonder why some of it couldn’t have seen its way to the dialogue.The story does have the villain and the hero outsmart each other constantly but that comes across as going through the drill. The addition of humour and patriotism also look like adding salt and pepper to bring flavour rather than being germane to a plot. Very conveniently the motivation of the covert operation moves from saving lives to national pride to world peace to saving lives to national pride to world peace. The humour is not in the jokes or situations as much as it is from the ridiculous concepts. The world’s most romantic 8-year old who is also the hero’s “I don’t care how you do it, just do it” boss, the national spy who also knows how to paint portraits on snow, the number of empty cars blown up, the amount of time the villain gang waits to shoot while the hero’s team does a panorama sweep with a machine gun – bring smirks rather than smiles. Amidst this though, the biggest positive is that songs don’t interrupt the proceedings. To that extent things are taken seriously. Of course, the background music more than compensates by abruptly alternating between a romantic tune that is tempered down to be sad as required and a pulsating, thriller, Bond-esque tune. Clearly, they aren’t experimenting much with the genre by keeping it plain, simple and in line with expectations. They do tread into the controversial territory of preaching sisterhood between India and Pakistan. While it is a noble thought with a lot of merit but the oversimplification fictionalises it a bit much. 1Your resentment is only on paper

At the box office, the audiences will give the film an epic ‘swagat’ as it is bound to entertain them thoroughly. This one is a SURE SHOT BLOCKBUSTER and nothing can stop it from setting new records.

Salman Khan hunting!
So many terrorists with an American accent?
The promos look dull.  Salman is turned into a desi Sylvester Rambo Stallone.  Rehashed action sequences.  If promos are so disheartening, I wonder what the movie is going to be like.  YRF just milking on the success of Tiger of 5 years ago?Totally agree!yeah its release today , i am so excited, i want to watch this movies as soon as it availble on internet :) <3Tu tu tu tu tu Tara.Tiger aa gaya phir dobara.Very often we come across promos that deceive. Tiger Zinda hai is one such case but the other way around, the film is a tad better than the promo.It has been ages since Hollywood had a one man army annihilating a battalion of armed to the teeth bad guys in a tornado style upheaval.  It took Bollywood ages to catch up, but catch up it did finally.  A film full of bullets raining left right centre, bombs and drones firing away every so often, more gun firing sounds then actual dialogues, probably the Hindi film with the least dialogues ever.  Action sequences are slickly shot but they lack imagination and originality.  Every other scene reminds you of something already seen in a Hollywood film, whether it is high octane Bond like chase in the Alps, or True Lies style couple on a mission, or John McCane from Die Hard, or the most obvious one many army in the form of Rambo Stallone.The Tiger is on a mission, and YRF has gone back to the ever successful 1970-1980 formula of having a crack team composed of wannabe stars, each getting his 2 minutes in the limelight.  The wannabe stars from diverse ethnic background to highlight the unity of strength, together with a pakka Musalman who is more patriotic and loyal to his country than anyone who has walked on the planet Earth.  Typical 1970s formula, often successfully played out by Pran-saab.As regards the music department, you have the constant playing of the Tiger signature tune in the background.  So much so that your ears keep on imagining that music hours after you leave the theatre.  And the non stop noise of weapons going off all the time. Surprising that no environmental protection groups brought out a PIL to seek a ban on the noise pollution.On the acting front, the only, one and only, character that made a positive and powerful impact, is Paresh Rawal.  Rest all, including Karnad are just props.  And yeah, for those who crave it, there is this prolonged topless scene of Salman.All this is enough to ensure that this average product goes on to be a commercial success.  For guys looking for good entertainment, brace yourself for a third installment because this is going to generate enough return on investment for YRF and brand Salman.Merry Christmas.Grand visuals, spectacular action, Salman Khan in Bond mode, Katrina Kaif in catwoman mode & a menacing antagonist make up for the illogical plot loopholes & lack of novelty in Tiger Zinda Hai. This one delivers what it promises. A surefire winter BLOCKBUSTER. The word of mouth in mass centers and B/C centers would be unanimously positive while the urban centers and metropolitan multiplexes would carry a mixed word of mouth that would prevent TZH from scaling the heights of Dangal or Bajrangi Bhaijaan. On the whole, the word of mouth should be 70-75% and the lifetime collections should be 300-325 cr range. My personal rating for the film would be a 7/10. A popcorn entertainer which despite its loopholes, makes a lot more sense than other action popcorn entertainers like the Dhoom films and the Race films.Wishing a very happy 2018 to all wogma friends.  And hoping for a much better filmy 2018.And yeah, hoping to read more from Anuj and Anup in 2018.Happy 2018 to you too!Tiger is Back after 8 years with loved ones.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.

Parental Guidance:


Violence: Loads
Language: Clean 
Nudity & Sexual content: A bare-chested Salman Khan and skimpily clad women dancing during the closing credits
Concept: Indian and Pakistani intelligence agencies take on a terrorist group 
General Look and Feel: The regular action fare though with relatively subtler colour schemes
