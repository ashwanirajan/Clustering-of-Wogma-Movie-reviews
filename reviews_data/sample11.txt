Relentless, intense, relentlessly intense are all the words that come to you during interval. After that though, the film loses steam slightly because it gets a touch repetitive. It is strange when you see the trailer of an Anurag Kashyap film and there isn’t a single witticism that is likely to stick with you. The lack of swear words seem out of place too. That and the regular tyrannical politician-goon versus underdog, story line doesn’t make you wait for the film with anticipation.The only thing that kindles any interest is the name Anurag Kashyap as you find likeness of language with Gangs of Wasseypur. But, similarities seem to end there. Unless of course, likelihood of great performances is a similarity you can attach to a director. After all, we have seen Jimmy Sheirgill as an intimidating authority often enough. The music kind-of shows its face as a reminder of the director’s films though I am not sure they will have as high a recall value. Walking in to the theater with balanced expectations doesn’t seem to be very difficult this once. Mukkabaaz releases on 12 January, 2018.Music Reviews:
Firstpost – "4/5" 
Milliblog – a 200 wrder that ends with,"Anurag’s stellar musical run continues, this time with Rachita Arora!" 
Music Aloud – "4/5" 
indian express – "It has its moments but is by no means an essential item on the playlist." 
Bombay Times – "beautiful bouquet that presents a veritable variety — contemporary songs, raga-based ones and also, folk tracks."

  Casteism, feminism, bureaucracy, state of sports – Mukkabaaz takes on all these causes in its stride. It puts them with the story of a boxer who faced roadblocks from all directions – enough to get you riled up and thinking about all the wrongs in our society today. Yet, it let’s go of all the energy in the last hour by making the film a tad repetitive. It is intense enough that you want a break from the aggressiveness of it all. However, the touch of humor and drama can be blamed for making that last hour feel like a bit of a stretch. Sure, some of the one-liners and situations make you laugh out loud and clap. And except for a couple of sequences where the background score pounds on till you realise that it is a dramatic moment, it adds value and pulses very well with the situations. But all of this takes your attention away from the story and disengages you a bit. So it is a balancing act between enjoying those sarcy but fun moments where the writers take a jab at Hindi films or a social situation and the intense familial or boxing stories. Individually, neither of these are striking enough to make you expect the unexpected. But collectively, you are constantly waiting for the worst to happen.The edge is sharper because every time you think the situation is exaggerated you remember this is inspired from a true life story. And if newspaper headlines are to go by, reality must be so much more worse. This after all was a much stronger couple facing the tyrannical uncle or the toxic boss. And they had support from other family members and coaches. What must meeker personalities with little or no support go through?While you don’t completely feel the pain because of the treatment, this empathy gets full backing from the performances. You hate the Bareilly coach, Bhagwan more because of Jimmy Shergill’s oft-repeated yet menacing body language. You take to Shravan’s grit and Sunaina’s firm boldness because of Vineet Kumar Singh and Zoya Hussain. You cheer Shravan when he intimidates an oppressor because of the actor’s perfect depiction of a small-time bureaucrat. You can’t think of this bureaucrat without thinking of the caste conflict brought out between Shravan’s boss and him is subtle yet powerful especially when compared to the blatant casteism that Bhagwan flaunts. Similarly, feminism takes a subtle flavour through Shravan and Sunaina’s relationship.These are things you have come to expect in Anurag Kashyap films. And yet, Mukkabaaz is different because it feels like the director is finally out of the zone where he wants to make a point. This story is being told because the story ought to be told and not because he wants to tell the story. This could also be why Mukkabaaz feels a little underwhelming. It has some great lines but it doesn’t have solid punch-lines. It has great writing but the writing doesn’t wear it’s political, social opinion on its sleeves. It has decent execution but the focus is on the narrative rather than style. Not that punch-lines, strong opinions or style was ever unenjoyable in Kashyap films, it’s just that here they are conspicuous by their absence – in a good way. It is nice to see a departure from the usual, even if it doesn’t completely work.

Vineet’s Shravan is often slighted, leading to outbursts that heat up the screen with the rage and grief of a man who is not getting a chance to show his talent.
Zoya Hussain uses her entire body to give a razor-sharp performance of a girl in defiance, communicating her defiance in sign language. She is unforgettable....

It isn’t a high funda picture on the problems of a boxer in India, it’s a throughly entertaining masala movie which you can enjoy and reflect upon. It could have been half an hour  to 20 minutes shorter because Anurag does get carried away in the narration of his characters. But you can safely put your money on this one and watch it raking prestigious honours if the antibodies don’t take offence to the real picture of our country that’s shown in the movie.

Kishan, with those great hurt eyes of his, is wonderful as well; why he’s cast so seldom in good Hindi films is a mystery. Sheirgill, through no fault of his own, is less memorable: the one-note antagonist he’s playing has nothing to do except escalate his villainy. There’s a brief period in the second half when the film seems to run out of ideas, yet even here Kashyap finds a detail, a scene, something to tide the audience by – like when Shravan decides to get unreasonably mad at his friend for using “doubtless” in a sentence.

No readers have rated this movie yet.This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.I remember watching Rajneeti with my mom. It was an uncomfortable experience due to certain scenes. Since then I always check parental guidance on wogma before going out for movie with family. I don’t know of any other site that provides parental guidance. But I have noticed that you have stopped providing this info now. Please bring it back, it was very useful.Oh I am sorry @Anshul. I had written it, forgot to paste it in the appropriate field in the backend. You can see it now.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.

Parental Guidance:


Violence: Loads and loads
Language: Clean but quite intense 
Nudity & Sexual content: None
Concept: A goon swears to never let a boxer raise to heights because the latter called his injustice. 
General Look and Feel: Gritty
