When you feel bad for the actors, you don't need to say any more about the film. The father-son banter and the obsession with calls of nature both point a knowing finger towards Piku. It will be an irony of sorts if that comes true. Father's film's trailer was enough to pull you over to the theater and son's film's trailer at best puts you off because it is loud and slapsticky.While I was looking forward to the next Rishi Kapoor starrer, he too seems to be trying too hard. Abhishek Bachchan's struggle with his films look like it is getting worse by the film. And while Asin and Supriya Pathak barely have any significance in the trailer, the hope is that they do more in the film for the latter can certainly pull a card or two of her own in the acting department.Despite interesting, catchy lyrics, the music isn't too appealing which isn't the best start for the film, but maybe just maybe the hint of son wanting to walk out of his father's shadow will be delved into deeper.

  I am sure I have mentioned my dislike for film marketing gimmicks like item numbers and closing credit songs. The best thing about All Is Well is the closing credit “shanivar” song and Sonakshi Sinha's “farrata” item number. That and sympathy for the actors are the two things I took from the film. Yes, that bad. My heart weeps for Abhishek Bachchan. Has it come down to this? For now, I have convinced myself that this is the Ajooba and Jaadugar phase of his career, while being cognizant that he hasn't had his Sholay or Janzeer. Because he is a good actor. Even in a badly written film like this he shows great restraint. He might not be the best fit to play a rockstar, yet his fake nonchalance towards his love interest is pretty believable. Anyway, point being, that is the thing I left the film with – feeling bad for Abhishek Bachchan. Of course, my heart wept for Rishi Kapoor and Supriya Pathak too. But somehow, we've seen them in better films in the last few years. Maybe this one worked out best for Asin – as reminder to the audience that she still exists. In the form of story, we have a sour parent-child relationship.  A full of himself dad and a thankless son make the perfect combination. But, they are too loud and they bicker – All. The. Time. The characters are pretty much insufferable. Not to mention, the movie tries way too hard to be funny and wraps it up with a sermon on importance of family. Doesn't work one bit. As I mentally go through all the departments of film-making wondering if a comment is worth the readers' time and mine, I come back to the same – two foot-tapping songs and deep sorrow for the actors.

But, despite of having a half baked story line and dragging screenplay the movie has its own merits to cherish. The good music, fine performances, few comical and emotional moments makes this movie a neat and clean family drama for its targeted audience...

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Abhishek has been plainly unlucky in the film selections.  Unfortunately for him each film that he selects gets a terrible treatment in the production phase which results in a terrible treatment at the box office.  I wish him luck as he is capable of carrying a film on his shoulders provided he gets good scripts filmed by good directors.Rishi Kapoor's behavior is getting unbearable on screen and off screen.  He confuses loudness with acting.  Of recent years the only subdued or measured acts that he gave was in Agneepath and Aurangzeb.  Rest all is of pure hamming level.Asin: well her 100% record in hindi films will now drop to 75% record.  And going by all accounts, it will remain at 75% as this is probably her last film ever.@meetu I feel for you that you had to watch it, for writing a review, even after indirect warnings in trailer :DYes, I realize having Amitabh Bachchan as a father is a really high bar for an actor to clear - but, aside from thinking he I'm trying to remember if I've ever seen a film where I've thought Junior was even in the same acting ballpark as his Dad - and, aside from thinking he wasn't bad in Game back in 2011, I can't say I have.Let Me Try This Again (my laptop rebooted in mid-post!):Yes, I realize having Amitabh Bachchan as a father is a really high bar for an actor to clear - but, aside from thinking he did a pretty decent job in Game back in 2011, I can't say I think Abhishek's even in the same acting ballpark as his Dad. He's okay at playing sullen loners, and can occasionally manage a likable bit of self-kidding, but he lacks both the range and natural authority Big B had even when he was a young actor. (I recently watched the original Zanjeer and, while it's dated in a lot of ways? It's easy to see why it made Amitabh Bachchan a major star....)Maybe Little B should consider following his sometimes co-star Uday Chopra behind the cameras, and seeing if he'd be a better director and producer than "Hero".Guess Whats coming next from Abhishek Bachan.Hera Pheri 3 not directed by Priyadarshan and Housefull 3 not even directed by Sajid Khan rather been directed by even worst director duo Sajid Farad (yes from Its Entertainment fame). And guess what he didnt get ? Dostana 2. Which was actually a nice movie just because of Abhishek Bachan and he has been dropped from the sequal project.. I guess we are not gonna see any decent movie of junior B atleast in near future. And this one is definitely a flop.  Good for Drishyam and Brothers to collect some more money..@Anup : Brothers has sunk at the box office and is a goner. Its a huge flop with lifetime collections that will be at par with Baby despite costing 1.5 times its amount. Baby & Gabbar were appreciated movies which did not get enough of an audience at the theaters due to Akshay's high headedness and reluctance to promote his own films. Brothers on the other hand is a purely boring and bad film which does not deserve an audience at all.Abhishek has neither the skill nor the ability to carry a film on his shoulders. Neither is he an out and out commercial actor like a Hrithik Roshan or an Akshay Kumar who can deliver entertainment potboilers and nor is he in the Irfan Khan/Nawauddin range. He's just a confused child of a yesteryear megastar whose tried his hand at mainstream as well as parallel cinema but has failed miserably at both.I don't know. I feel he has a style of his own that can be capitalised. But have to keep shut till I see it :DWhen the thugs behave less like goons and more like buffoons you know that you are watching a film where you have to hide your thinking cap and don your logicless hindi film cap.I have no issues with that.  Have watched baby's day out with similarly stupid goons.  Only hiccup is that this brainless caper also happens to be a story less caper. Which is a pity as the message of family being important got lost in the medium that the director chose to convey the message.  A feel good moment does happen albeit very late in the film, which highlights the fact that the director is capable of delivering. Felt bad for Abhishekh. I found him alright in the film. The discovery of the film of course being M Z Ayyub as the bumbling Chima. I had never realised that he had such fantastic comic timing.  I hope that he gets further comic roles doing justice to his talent.@Meeta - I think Little B might? But really, I think he needs to move to another country where he's not Son of Film Royalty and do a couple movies, to see if that doesn't challenge him creatively.@Fan yeah, I didn't mind Chima either :D@TimELiebe hmmm...I wonder if that would make a difference. If script choice is a problem because of which not good scripts are offered to him it is a not-so-nice little circle.@Meeta - past a certain point if you're a major star (in any country), I'd think "script choice" is as much the actor's (or his management's) fault as the producers'. As @ANuP pointed out, he didn't get Dostana 2 - the sequel to the superhit he was one of the three stars of! Unless he's got a reputation for being as impossible to work with as Katherine Heigl has over here (maybe exaggerated because she's female, a bit), I have to assume it was Little B's choice to walk away from that - and to accept Housefull 3 (!),  Hera Pheri 3 (!!!), and this Triumph of Modern Cinema instead. Why would he do that, anyway...?¯\_(ツ)_/¯Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com. All rights reserved.(Credits: wogma logo by Ain Digytal Inc. wogma audio review signature tune by Shreyas Beltangdy.
