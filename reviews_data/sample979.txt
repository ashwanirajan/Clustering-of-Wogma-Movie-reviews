
wogma rating: Watch if you have nothing better to do (?)
All but a couple Muslim's are terrorists. Is that what we need to hear in this day & age? Predictable to the minutest detail and utterly-butterly s..l..o..w. You sure have better ways to induce yawns now, don't you?"All Muslim's are terrorists." In order to prove that the Western world thinks that way, Rensil D'Souza and Karan Johar go that extra mile to showcase the very same thing. And, hopefully inadvertently, complete the circle and cast the despicable stereotype in a deeper mould. Why are good Islamic citizens left out?

Ok, I'm taking the same route and exaggerating a bit here. But only a bit. A couple of Muslim characters in Kurbaan are not fundamentalists and are not blind followers of their religion. But just 2-3 between 12-13 main characters can see that their faith is being misused. That's a gross overstatement of the human race's irrationality. And even if I'm naïve that that's how things are. How does decorating that fact with a star couple help? 
Saif Ali Khan plays Ehsaan and is rather stiff. Somehow, he doesn't seem at ease with the character. Except for a few scenes with Kareena Kapoor (Avantika, the girl next door). And those scenes are really well-done. Kareena looks the prettiest without make-up on and is by-far the most huggable sight when her character is supposed to cry. This woman can act. It's a pity only a few directors find her potential size-exponential worth exploring too. The rest of the cast except for Vivek Oberoi are just doing their drill. No record-breaking performances asked for, none given. 
Physical intimacy is not something Indian filmmakers are very good at. But, here there's nothing crude and both actors fit just right. Now, whether the scene was a "script ki maang" (need of the script) or not is very debatable. And clearly, this much-talked about scene is as predictable and lame as ever. The pre-release attention that the scene has been intentionally awarded with makes the timing even more obvious. That still doesn't take away from the fact that it is worth every marketing penny spent on the skin-show. Delicious! 
And these things are major let-downs after the slick title sequence. It's so refreshing, especially when you are expecting a Dharma Productions product to bank on a crisp, fresh view of the New York skyline. Thankfully, the smart production values continue after that. The background score and actually, the lack of it for almost two-thirds of the film is not only worth a round of applause but it also tried its best to keep you focused on the acting and reacting. Some great work by the Foley artist. Similarly, the framing of individual shots are very engaging. They are different and try their best to build the curiosity.  
But, neither sound nor visuals can take the place of the story and more importantly of the details that make the story. They all take the beaten path. The community that the terrorists belong to feel marginalized and the only way to deal with that is to shoot on sight - even people belonging to their own community, it is martyrdom after all. Every time someone on screen said that, I felt my skin crawl. I'm sure the line, like many other done-to-death dialogues, was a really strong statement when it was used the first time. But, now you know that argument and want to hear the real people talking. 
Especially because the makers are very clear about making this a serious, dark film. How in such a case can a small terrorist group act in a void, by themselves, with no apparent help from outside? And it's not like we are following one or the other character's story. It's all plain and stagnant. They want to kill, kill, kill and they kill, kill, kill. 
Over 5 hours after the film and I still can't figure out what the purpose of the film is. 
To entertain? It got way too many unintentional laughs, right down to the convenient glass of milk showing up as expected. 
To tell a story? Whose? 
Avantika's? I know nothing about her except that she's a professor in psychology with no apparent insight into human nature. Though her struggle to be in love and the resultant helplessness is obvious. 
Ehsaan's? Maybe. But how much do we really know about him? He is in dilemma. Sure, but what about it? I don't empathize with him, I don't hate him, because I haven't a clue why he does what he does.  
The story of a terror attack? Which one? The one in the planning of which I wasn't allowed to participate? The games and counter-games seem to be serving no particular end.
I don't like the tone of such films that almost feel like they take pleasure in reinforcing the stereotype. Where's the balance? Where's the grey? Where's the human face of cold-blooded murder? It does have one, or doesn't it? Are our film-makers claiming that there are absolutely no non-Muslims involved in these acts of terror?

KURBAAN is NEW YORK. But with a different set of actors. KURBAAN is also SHOOT ON SIGHT, again with different actors. The plot remains the same, the twists and turns fails to surprise you and the end is inevitable. However, here, the love story has been hyped, thanks to Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor having an off-screen romance as well. But the intensity and the love undercurrents between Katrina Kaif and Neil Nitin Mukesh, and the romance between Kaif and John Abraham that was visible in NEW YORK is missing in KURBAAN.

Technically the movie is sound; acting wise, everyone chips in with a fine performance. The look, feel and action sequences are top class, but then you are not seeing anything new that has not been shown in the recent past. The above-mentioned films are just the recent references.

Ehsaan (Saif Ali Khan) falls in love with Avantika (Kareena Kapoor). Both teach in the same college in New Delhi. Avantika is back from the US, as she had to tend to her ailing father. Six month later, she gets a call from her University to come back. Ehsaan says he does not mind sacrificing his career to join her. He is traditional he says, not selfish. So off they go to the US and manage to find a home in an Indian neighbourhood. She also manages to find him a job in her college. Their neighbours befriend the new couple and that's when things spiral out of control.

There are many loose ends. The US knows Ehsaan as Khalid the dreaded terrorist. They have his photograph. When he comes back to the US with Avantika as Ehsaan, he has just trimmed his beard to a French cut. He still looks the same, yet they cannot detect him entering Kennedy Airport!

In one scene, where Saif and his fundamentalist pal are going off to dispose a dead body, they are trapped in a routine road check. Bullets are exchanged and there is a chase. It is hard to digest the fact that these cops in the US would not have called for a back up. They all get killed and Saif escapes with a bullet wound. He gets it treated at home and a few minutes later, he is in the shower. The wound is still fresh.

There are a few more loose ends but the biggest joke is the character (a television journalist) played by Vivek Oberoi. An aircraft carrying a delegation of US officials along with hordes of journalists has been blown up mid air. He loses his girlfriend Dia Mirza in that blast. In his office, he hears Avantika's frantic message asking Dia not to board the flight as there is a bomb on board and her husband too is involved. Armed with the most vital clue, Vivek decides to investigate the bombing himself! He joins their network to learn more and no one misses him at his work place. All he had to do was give the FBI a tip-off after learning of their activities in the first two meetings, if not at the first instance. I mean, c'mon, this here is a big bombing, and you are sitting on the most telling lead!

Nothing adds up but for the hyped romance between Saif and Kareena. Both are in terrific form.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Boy, Ehsaan (Saif Ali Khan) meets girl, Avantika (Kareena Kapoor). They fall in love. But do they? Are they really who they say they are?Boy, Ehsaan (Saif Ali Khan) meets girl, Avantika (Kareena Kapoor). They fall in love. But do they? Are they really who they say they are?
Kareena Kapoor's makeup all through the film.
The fact that a person loves his parent more than his unborn child.
The entire bullet-retrieval scene. Very intentionally wants you to squirm and succeeds.
The classroom argument.

The self-referencing Coffee Khan!
The horror film like sound and direction when Avantika finds out about her neighbors.
How come Avantika is home waiting for her husband every day? 
Why was the entire gang of terrorists required to stay in the same neighborhood?! Hush-hush activity - stay away from each other, no?
Could the pregnancy have been more convenient!!?
Ok. A pregnant lady suffering from morning sickness, doesn't as much as gag while doing a blood-oozing act of mini-surgery. If she were a doctor, that could still have been acceptable, but this…hmmm…
What was the plan to kill the guy at the bar if there was no fork around?! Where were all the guns that they blatantly used throughout the film?
How does one slip out of a car from the floor of the car, again?
The perfect timing between Vivek Oberoi and Kirron Kher's entries and exits at the shopping mall. A bit too coincidental.

Avantika's first meeting with Ehsaan. "Swine" that's all a strong-willed girl like her could say??
I haven't seen the movie yet but read reviews online. Most of them said 3 to 3.5 stars out of 5.Your review says otherwise. I don't understand this huge difference to be honest. Thing is, maybe you were too much trying to find out the logic behind everything that you lost the soul of the movie. Firstly, you just cannot expect that much logic from Indian films NOT because the directors are incapable but because such movies are not commercial viable.Secondly, even without that logic, it's not that the movie will suck! There is STILL a lot of things to be seen and thought of. In short, I found your review to be too extreme. Of course this is your blog and you can write anything you wish ;) but as a reader I didn't find it worth reading and coming back for more ;)Yup...I agree with you esp when you said- no great performance asked, no delivered.Kareena kapoor is the only best part of this movie. Wish they would ve utilized her presence better and try to make a more reasonable movie than the streotype the did.I didn't like this movie as well. For slightly different reasons though.My dislike is not the result of the director's depiction of 'all Muslims are terrorists'. I don't think a director necessarily has a social responsibility. He's making a movie. A piece of fiction. And I don't care what he chooses to show - if the story demands all Muslims to be terrorists, so be it. As long as it's convincing in the universe of the movie, I don't care if it breaks all the rules and notions of our REAL universe. It's FICTION.Having said that, I think the story-telling and plot was executed unconvincingly. As you correctly mentioned, the director was unable to invoke any empathy in audience's mind for ANY of his characters. Avantika almost became a piece of furniture after the intermission. Saif's ethical dilemma was left completely unexplored. Heck, the movie's title is based on his character (he's the one who got kurbaan for his love in the end) but he was not even given a few lines that stuck with me after the movie was over. (Sorry, Anurag Kashyap, but the dialogues were just sloppy - for the most part.)a totaly borecopy of new york no songs to enjoyi don`t understand what to watch in itCopyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.

Parental Guidance:


Violence: A very nicely done but very gory shot of a bullet being pulled out. Other than that gun fights, blood splatter, etc in plenty.
Language: No profanity. But it reeks of fanaticism. 
Nudity & Sexual content: A few lip-locks and a bedroom scene with bare backs shown. Also the same scene implies the couple reaching a climax.
Concept: That of fundamentalism and citizens feeling marginalized, committing acts of terror in the name of revenge.
General Look and Feel: Dark and grim.
