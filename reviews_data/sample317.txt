Not even one of those "so bad that it's good" films. When you walk into a film called "The Xposé" and you know the word will stand for both skin-show and a big reveal equally, you aren't really walking in with too many expectations. I actually look forward to a line or two that will entertain/engage or at the very least amuse me. No such luck.Oh wait, Himesh Reshammiya's character Ravi is so obnoxious that it is amusing, till he gets annoying. But, till then, I was in awe of the person who thought of such an arrogant style for the protagonist. So, I am not rooting for the character, who is supposedly mean for the good. I don't care who he falls in love with and what he is willing to do for her. Considering it is a murder mystery, you'd think you are made to care about the victim. But, you are asked, neigh begged, to judge her negatively from the first frame she shows up in. And when the big "expose" happens, you don't care either. Sure, the writer has tried hard to make it a huge reveal, but it just doesn't matter enough. In addition, it goes overboard in increasing the tension. Yes, additional drama in terms of slo-mo scenes and dramatic background score. But, also story-wise it goes says more than once, "not over yet, there's more."The performances are as perfunctory as they can get. To rub salt into the wound, you have Irrfan Khan doing a voiceover. The setting of the 70s doesn't work at all. The songs, well has either, Yo Yo Honey Singh or Himesh Reshammiya as their singer. So, there's no looking for respite there. The sliver lining is - it is a short film. And that it has come out on a day where people are generally, likely to care about it even less than usual - let alone read its review.

        ...Well, if you like Himesh Reshammiya's music and enjoy good masala entertainer then this movie won't disappoint you. It's not a masterpiece or a realistic type of cinema with good research work over its periodic settings as its sole purpose is to entertain its masala movie loving audiences. Would recommend the intellectual audiences to stay away from this movie. As for all others who were not expecting anything from this movie, 'The Xpose' turns out to be shockingly entertaining and apt for its targeted audience....

        ...The dialogues are audience rousing no doubt and the music inveigles its way into your mind (even if you don’t want it to). The first half tries to emulate the flamboyance and colour of Baz Luhrman’s ‘the Great gatsby’ but can manage only an insipid, artifice laden visual engagement. Mahadevan is deft in his craft and doesn’t allow time for any questioning of logic. There are plenty of loopholes scattered around the narrative but the high entertainment levels keep you engaged enough to overlook them. This is not a masterpiece or even a great thriller-romance. It’s just a passably entertaining one!...

RoutingViruses:
          'The Expose' shows how you convert a horror movie into a comic one

          Review: The Xpose has nothing new, and it doesn't even care: Saddled with glaring plot holes, caricaturish sup... http://t.co/5H3WPWbv5C

Bawara_Mann:
          #TheXpose ko dekh ke lagta hai ki #Himesh ko Roti nahi sirf Struggling mili hai
        
BanarasiGunda:
          इतनी ओवर एक्टिंग है #TheXpose में की आपका माथा ख़राब हो जायेगा। ऊपर से फिल्म के डाईलाग इतने घटिया की मुह से गाली ही निकलती है।
        
avinash16:
          Another cult classic after Gunda, The Expose
        
asjadnazir:
          Was there a "This Movie Could Be Injurious To Your Health..." warning before The Xpose started? #TheXpose #HimeshStopActing (please)
        
AramushaHime:
          The Xposé is one of the worst movies of the decade.... not that anybody cares
        
amishah0505:
          Watched #TheXpose. Highly Entertaining - Na Dance.. Na Expression.. Na Pose.. Only EXPOSE. Janta ne Ek Bhi Mauka Nahi Choda Hasne Ka!

: Bad Acting and Aweful direction
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.What more can we expect from a Himesh Starrer. Like his voice as a torture wasn't enough that he started acting. He should only do what he is good at :Music Direction". That's it.A crisp review very well put. :)Thanks for the share.I was expected much from this movie, himesh not good as an actor......Sabne kaha ye movie has bekarIsko mila bas ek hi starWill skip the movie this shukravaarKyonki....Abki baar Modi sarkar@Divya that was hilarous to say least.@Meetu i would say hats off to you to even watch this film on theatre because i could not watch whole movie on my laptop.I would say tumhari galti ko meri Aankhon ne dekha meri yaddast ne nhi :-)Thanks @Nikhil!@Divya :D @siddharth ab kya kahu? mera toh dil hi kuchh aisa hai. As long as there are people who appreciate the effort, enough for me to go on ;)Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
