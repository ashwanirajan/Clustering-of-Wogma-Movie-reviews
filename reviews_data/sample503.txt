wogma rating: Watch when on TV/online (?)
Murder 3 has a drawn-out set-up. It draws up to 90 minutes. That's when the real story begins. The last 30-40 minutes of disclosure might just make it worth a DVD/TV watch. No one is expecting anything new out of this one from the Bhatt camp, is there? Same old combination of a few steamy scenes, a photographer/artist protagonist, and some fake spook. It's not because of the 'Murder' franchise, as it is because of the look and feel that the trailer carries. A very typical B-grade horror movie feel.In fact, after Murder 2, it wouldn't have been surprising if Murder 3 took horror to the next level. But, then again Murder 2 was horrifying mainly because of Prashant Narayanan's performance. We don't have him here. Randeep Hooda does do the sinister look alright here but it is too in the face. I am assuming he's not going to be that bad after all and this is just the makers' way of getting us to believe that he's the villain. Interestingly, the music has had extreme reactions from reviewers. They have either hated it or loved it. I think it'll be a success if the film matches up even that. Music Reviews:
Apun Ka Choice - "4/5"
Bollyspice - "1.5/5"
Bollywood Hungama - "5/5"
Bollywood Life - "2/5"  
dunkdaft - "doesn't offer anything new and noticeworthy"
glamsham - "3.5/5"
IBN Live - "4/5"
Milliblog - "Vishesh Films perhaps needs a relook at their musical strategy."

  You wait for the thrills and shrills to begin. You wait and you wait and you wait. Finally, an hour and a half later, you don't get the shreiks alright - thank goodness for some mercies - but you get a very interesting premise to hook you in. Too late? May be. Too little? May be.Just way too much time is spent on establishing a flaky love affair. You don't know why one has fallen in love with another or why stays in love either. Given the number of things to cause mistrust the love should've have fallen apart a couple of days into the relationship. Anyway, so, much-too-much love happens in South Africa, Goa, Mumbai and I'm sure a few other exotic locations. There is an air of mystery but as an experienced audience you have an inkling it's misleading. When, the real mystery is unveiled, you sit up. A world of possibilities opens up. A lot of test-of-character is bound to occur. These opportunities are utilized well too.The question then is whether or not you can forgive the time spent in getting there. Here, you should be warned that even the events of the last half hour are a tad predictable. Not necessarily because you are a step ahead of the makers or have seen it before, but because you are given that extra thirty seconds to guess what will happen next. And you are more likely than not going to guess right. Aditi Rao Hydari's performance too makes things engaging. I just hope she gets a role soon, that can use the talent she seems to have. Randeep Hooda and Sara Loren carry typical plastic expressions I associate with this genre of horror/thrillers produced. Randeep a little less than Sara, because of Sara's drone-like dialogue delivery. The background music tries hard to create spook and fails.  The camera doesn't try to pull anything outside the box. The songs are like any other recent product from the Bhatt factory. Why are the makers not willing to let go of these clichés? Why is it so difficult to go beyond? Especially when they have willingly accepted that they are drawing from another film - La cara oculta, Spanish this time.You cannot but help think - given a combination of a woman's instinct and her insecurity and a physical atmosphere of claustrophobia, Murder 3 ought to have arrested us.

: ‘Murder 3’ is a sappy entertainer, which can be watched only if you have plenty of free time.
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Mark my words,without Emraan Hashmi the Murder franchise is a big dud..that guy single handedly made a blockbuster out of a very mediocre script in Murder 2,doubt if Randeep Hooda can do the same.As for Aditi Rao,the baby faced chick is a complete misfit and is nowhere near as sensuous as Mallika and Jacqueline!@Anuj I do believe that Emraan Hashmi brings his own brand of charm to the films he does. Otherwise, I am just tired of all the "sequels".Jism 2,Jannat 2,Murder 2,Raaz 3 etc cannot be termed as sequels.They're independent films cashing in on the popularity of the franchise name.But despite that i don't think Murder 3 will work unless its got an extremely riveting and engaging script.Randeep is no Emraan and Aditi's no Mallika/Jacqueline. PS:I wish they had taken Prashant in this one.He was the show stealer in Murder-2!Stunning performance.@Anuj Yep! that's why the "" around sequels. :) I loved Prashant Narayanan's performance too. Eerie, creepy and all their synonyms.@meeta:One thing's for sure..this one's gonna be a rip off of some Korean/Japanese/Portuguese or French film :D@Anuj I know...Murder 3 Missed Emran Hashmi.Without Emran Murder Will be Flop ;)By the way, this is the official remake of the Spanish movie The Hidden Face :)Fabulous last paragraph!!‘MURDER 3’ is a pointless late bloomer!@Keyur Yes, as I mentioned in the review, the Spanish title is  La cara oculta.@Harsh Thank you!So Murder-2 continues to be the best film in the franchise,at least for now!@Meeta:Kindly get the problem fixed.I'm "not interested in watching this movie".A "Thumbs Up" is out of question :POveroll Movie is Not Bad.But I Think Murder Sequence is Not Fullfil Without Emran.We Hope Murder 4 With Emran Hashmi@Anuj *sigh* sorry again. Have reported the error. We'll try once again to fix the problem.If anybody ever had doubts about Emraan Hashmi's box office pull and mass popularity i think the fiasco of Murder-3 is the perfect answer to them!@Anuj You are really sticking up for Emraan Hashmi. :) I love it when there's such passion. Keeps things human. :DDirection: 2    Story: 2.5    Lead Actors: 2    Character Artists: 1.5    Dialogues: 2    Screenplay: 1.5    Music Director: 1.5    Lyrics: 1This is really very nice movie.
