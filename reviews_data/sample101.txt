
wogma rating: Add to 'must watch' list (?)
You forget you are watching a film for a lot of the 2+ hours. Doesn't wrench your heart or gut, but works on the mind. Hopefully. It is unclear whether Amitabh Bachchan plays the accused women's advocate or is interrogating them. He looks like he is playing devil's advocate in one scene and in another he looks like he is out to get them. He absolutely is not going easy on them. And then you question if the trailer has been cut in such a way that it answers none of these questions. And slam dunk, you want to watch the film.In addition, the theme relates to eve-teasing and everything that goes with it. A topic that is not only in the news but one a woman can relate to effortlessly. And then you nicely round it off with the fact that it has support of reliable filmmakers like Shoojit Sircar. Just Amitabh Bachchan is enough to make many of us want to watch this film. Everything else about Pink add to that eagerness even more!Music Reviews:
Bollyspice – "3.5/5"   
    - meeta, a part of the audience
  Pink isn't really a fictional film, is it? It might as well have been a documentary. In fact, a lot of the screenplay, must read like one. A very engrossing documentary, though. One that from the word go makes you identify with it. However, every once in a while it reminds itself that it is a movie, as if it were mandatory - by use of a song or a  break from the drama. Pink is so close to home that only a few of those digressions bother you. As a middle-aged, urban woman with two teenage kids, one of whom is a girl – the questions Pink raises are something I struggle with on an almost day-to-day basis.  As a middle-aged, urban woman who likes to meet new people, I have often had to think about what my actions must be construed as by the people around me. I cannot even imagine what it must be like for a young girl who lives by herself. This identification has been used to Pink's advantage. Well, for starters, you smirk at the sarcasm in its title. To make the point it wants to, it's important that the audience feel like it could happen to them any day. As it very well might. However, it still doesn't hit the gut. There is just the one scene that makes you squirm. I would think that would be the root of the courtroom drama. But the rest of the film, barely mentions it. It nagged me through the film. But, as an afterthought, might as well. If a relatively less serious offense can be brought to attention. The more serious one is taken care of by itself. Nip it in the bud, so to speak. However, when I say that, I go out on a limb here. Because as a psychiatrist friend once told me, it doesn't matter whether it was “actual” rape or not. The only thing that matters is the violation that the victim feels.Apologies, I digress again. I like films that make me digress in this manner. They have to be well-written and well-performed for it to be so effective. The girls all play the bits well enough for us to worry about them. The guys make you want to hold them by the collar and punch their eye. If anyone, the prosecutor, played by Piyush Mishra comes across like a caricature; his act a bit over-done.In Amitabh Bachchan films, I always admire how you tend to forget the actor and remember the character he played, especially while you are watching the film. Here I was slightly worried that the film might become about this mentally deteriorating lawyer. But, the film is only and only about the issue. The lawyer, the victims, the culprits serve only one purpose – to bring the issue forth.And of course there is a sermon. It is broken into pieces and is not one long lecture. But it is a speech nevertheless. That Amitabh Bachchan is delivering it, makes you listen to it with rapt attention. That it is about a topic that means something to you, helps you too. But hey, it is a sermon nevertheless. And my problem with them is that they jolt you out of the story making you realise again that it is a film you are watching. Equally jarring is the song that abruptly begins in the background. Also, a little less of the setup and a little more of the courtroom drama would have worked better. Even so, when it is time, as a parent of a girl, I would want her to watch this film. I believe, I don't have to teach her, her rights. But, just to be sure, maybe I should. As a parent of a boy, I would want him to watch this film. I believe, I don't have to teach him physical boundaries and the meaning of consent. But, just to be sure, maybe I should. And if the lad has to get a sermon, why not from the man himself, why not through a story with characters to hate and root for, why not through a display of emotions very real. Yeah, yeah, yeah, trust a parent to turn a film into education. But, did I not mention, Pink might as well have been a dramatic documentary? A good one, at that.

        ...But other parts of Pink are beautifully subtle. Consider the scene where Meenal goes running in a park and stops for a breather, when she sees Deepak staring at her. (At that point, he hasn’t yet taken up the case. He’s just a neighbour.) She stares right back. Later, another neighbour – another man – stands in his balcony and looks towards the girls’ flat. The film doesn’t make much of this by way of a plot point. But a hint is left hanging, that had this flat been occupied by three unmarried men, these neighbours wouldn’t be looking. Unless, of course, this was another kind of pink movie.

At the Box Office, it will be patronised by the multiplex audiences and the positive word of mouth will translate into healthy footfalls for the movie. Don't miss this one as it hammers home a very powerful message.

The last scene in the movie is bound to give you the chills. This is Bengali film director Aniruddha Roy Chowdhury’s Bollywood debut and is produced by Shoojit Sircar. All in all, this is the Movie of the Year for me. I urge you to watch it with your family and friends.

It teaches everyone a valuable lesson about consent and tells the story through a taut thriller that shocks and awes us. Pink is a must watch.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.waiting to watch Tapsee Pannu after Baby movie.I have been curious about the movie from the day I stumbled upon its trailer. I would have always watched it. But thanks to your review I know a few things, kind of gives me perspective without spoiling the plot. As detailed as this could be, a nice review.Young man or old, you can just never take the anger out of this legend! Yet another stupendous, mind blowing & hard hitting performance from this everlasting university of acting. I am almost certain PINK will carry a 90%+ recommendation rate among the urban multiplexes of Delhi/NCR, Mumbai, Pune, Bangalore and Kolkata and despite a slow start it has every chance of netting ₹ 50 cr+ at the domestic box office. That would be a solid final number for a low budgeted movie made on a cost of <₹30 cr and catering to a very limited niche audience of urban multiplex centers who fancy such dark, broody and intense films. PINK will easily do a lot better than both WAZIR and TE3N, although imo those 2 were decent thrillers too. But PINK raises the bar to a different level altogether.Had Hitting on male supremacy and on the BS about high morality grounds for girlsSanitized and simplified yet engrossing throughout. The loose end, as it were, disturbs [comment partially delete because it gives a part of the movie away]. The girls are superb. Amitabh is less hammy than usual. Piyush Mishra is not as bad as is made out by some reviewers. Even the boys have been well selected. Overall, a very good watch.The benefits of living in an independent democratic secular republic are that you can be any random tom, dick or harry & yet call the legend of Amitabh Bachchan hammy! Of course its a different matter that 99.9% of the clowns making such statements are either [comment partially delete because it is a personal attack]!Labeling Amitabh Bachhan's performances (other than in Pink) as hammy?Now that's a first.Some commentators do inadvertently reveal their age when commenting on all time greats.Without the slightest of doubt this film rates in the top 3 films of 2016.  And definitely should be part of the best of the best all time collections.The subject is so pertinent in Indian context, but even in global context (very few countries are untouched by this social threat).All throughout the film one pines for the girls, and that is no mean feat to achieve by the director.  Amitabh Bachhan as the retired lawyer is simply amazing.  One of his finest acts.Only thing that was unclear to me was why mix the personal background of the character played by Amitabh Bachhan in this drama?  Still wondering.But overall, I do recommend everyone to watch this film at least once, and more importantly to imbibe the lesson that it says.  NO is a NO.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
