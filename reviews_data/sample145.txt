
wogma rating: Watch when on TV/online (?)
Engaging to the senses - visually and musically - is poetic even. Ironically, the heart though, is kept at bay.Fitoor, obsession – obsessed by love, looks like in this case – is an intense title by itself. It sets the mood. Then you watch the trailer and the strong feelings of the lovers comes through. Now, the question is will it hold through the length of the film. The story itself is unlikely to be very different from love stories we have seen earlier. In fact, there is a strong flavor from Baaghi though Fitoor looks a lot more polished. Interestingly, both Kareena Kapoor and Abhishek Roy Kapoor seem to fit in perfectly into the roles and the fervor required for their parts. The music too has taken the listeners in their stride. Looks like Fitoor has set the stage for us to go in with reasonable expectations of being entertained and engaged.Music Reviews:
Bollywood Hungama - "4/5" 
Firstpost - "this album is going to be on loop" 
glamsham – "3.5/5" 
Milliblog - "highly tuneful soundtrack that gets the best out of its singers, and of course, the composer!" 
Music Aloud – "8.5/10"

  Fitoor has dream-like visuals. In that sense it completely absorbs you in its world. But, unfortunately, only the visuals are arresting, and to an extent the atmosphere that the music creates. The story however, as it progresses, does its best to disengage you from itself. No number of good-looking people can save you from that then.It would be unfair to say that Aditya Roy Kapoor and Katrina Kaif are only appealing to the eye and have nothing to offer in the acting department. There are subtle sighs and eye movements that add to the essence of the scene. But, to ask them to hold a film on their pretty shoulders, is a bit much. We have seen Aditya Roy Kapoor sulk and carry a morose air about him through a film, so this does come across as a repeat performance. And, Katrina Kaif (and even the child artist who plays her character's younger role) plays femme fatale quite well. But given her gorgeousness, she doesn't need to do much . However, for a change this time around with the extra layer of charming fat on her cheeks, she comes across as homely too. Tabu is enigmatic too, but her character comes across as forcibly so and then gets a tad too dramatic towards the end.However, a romance where there is more chemistry between the characters when they aren't together compared to when they finally do get together, has got its grammar wrong somewhere. The disconnect when they are together would have been alright too, if it were not for the climax chosen. Except for the first half hour, where our protagonists are growing up, the story is fragmented. You don't know why these people are so madly in love with each other. Love at first sight and puppy love? Sure, I will take that as a given and enjoy the intensity of obsessive love. Despite this acceptance though, the details are sorely missing. Fitoor comes across as an extremely superficial view of the couple's love for each other – both in longevity and intensity. Similarly, the political angle is touched upon rather perfunctory. It's like the writers knew, the love story wouldn't be enough by itself and needed some other meat to hold the viewers' interest. Fitoor is Vishal Bharadwaj's eccentrity combined with a Sanjal Leela Bhansali's visual acumen. And yet that doesn't end up being a compliment. Maybe a case of too many influences spoil the broth?

        ...Kapoor ditches many of the overarching social themes of Great Expectations to focus on what is primarily the story of star-crossed lovers and a complex romance. Fitoor isn’t perfect, but it’s a skillfully made film that’s easy on both the eye and the ear. In these times of fast-paced, hyperactive storytelling, you can appreciate the film’s dreamy, moody pace. I’m going with three out of five.

But while Bhansali seemed to retrofit a plot into a film that did not need one, Kapoor does not succumb to this temptation. Consequently, Fitoor is a more consistent and a stronger film, even if it’s appeal may be limited for the same reasons.

Lara Dutta, playing a savvy and exploitative art-dealer, brands his first showing smartly in order to cash in on Noor's roots, calling it The Boy From Dal. If only he weren't such a dull boy.

          Change of thinking is reqrd. Please do not over rate things. Fitoor is average at best. Chinatown, Citizen kane, Cadablanca r great #Fitoor

PieKapoor:
          Watched Fitoor. It was very pretty, but somewhat all over the place. Still better than we expected, so I'd say it was okay overall.
        
MubeenKh:
          Fitoor okay movie with good acting 
        
mridu_la:
          #Fitoor Tabu, Aditya were good. Kat avg. 2nd half slow. More conversation was needed b/wn the leads to establish chemistry. We Loved Fitoor
        
iamanishb:
          Strong acting, awesome music, sinking storyline. #Fitoor
        
Davita_Kd:
          #Fitoor the only reason to watch is for #Tabu my goodness what an actor! Cudnt take my eyes n want more of her!
        
boyfriendkapoor:
          Ok so I liked it but I could not love it . I have my reasons which you may read in my review #Fitoor
        
AS_Aru:
          Watched Fitoor yesterday.Yessss!!it was beautiful. But dint really love the film.
        
aliamalik:
          I'll rate #Fitoor 2.5/5. Tabu was excellent. Aditya: a sight for sore eyes. Katrina: beautiful but deadpan. No 'Great Expectations' per se!
        
abhishek6259:
          First half of Fitoor is good...but the 2nd half is pretty much boring n perplexing.

          As is quite clear from its title, Fitoor (obsession) is a love story. So poor, but artistic Kashmiri boy Noor ...  https://t.co/gPCqyhT62l

sunnyraghav87:

SRKsAvenger:
          Fitoor dekh ke bheje ki bajj gayi .. ab ek baar aur deapool dekhni padegi .
        
sonika_sethi:
          #Fitoor was a slow film that fell flat. Probably the best thing about it was Tabu's acting
        
smartrintu:
          #SanamRe crap movie... even worst than #GhayalOnceAgain ... #Fitoor holy shit.. #SanamTeriKasam is way more watchable than these 3
        
SilverSweater:
          Country is so obsessed with illogical&nautanki movies that some art becomes depressing!

No doubt Bollywood&audience r stupidest!! #Fitoor
        
sidkakspeaks:
          Fitoor is a never-ending obsession in slow motion! Actors are brilliant but wasted. Kashmir exquisitely filmed but direction is listless..
        
Ravikumar8055:
          #Fitoor will disappoint you, a great story ruined badly by weak direction and,
Katrina is very consistent towards her bad acting

prakashrthd:
          #Fitoor watched last night. Amazing story but direction is not well. Katrina is not perfect for this movie. 1 out 5 star.
        
PandeyRishita:
          Only tabbu looks alive in #fitoor rest aditya,katrina n aditi look dead n retarded.such a waste of time.

ManojG7:
          Fitoor seems was the Fitoor of directors version of Love Tragedy Deceit but alas it's too slow , boring and confusing ! Sadly sad movie
        
mannshandilya:
          #Fitoor one of the worst movies i have watched.
        
malaiam:
          Expected more from #Fitoor. Intensity of Dickens' layered story replaced with bland love story. #Tabu & cinematography only saving grace.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Direction: 1    Story: 1.5    Lead Actors: 1.5    Character Artists: 1.5    Dialogues: 1.5    Screenplay: 2    Music Director: 0.5    Lyrics: 1.5Aditya acted very wel,movie story was confusing first until ajay devgan shows up in th end,good movie, must watch, THANKSA love story, inspired by one of the all time biggest global blockbuster novel, is enough to entice me to give a look.But Fitoor makes a half hearted product and thus very painful to watch.  When your heart does not ache for the lead lover pair, then you know that the story is extremely poorly executed.The visuals (many done in Poland) are awesome.  If the story and performance had been given the same importance then the film would have been a masterpiece, which it is far from being.The visuals seem to have taken the front seat so much so that the director keeps in flipping between autumn and winter in random order - making one wonder if any attempt was made to ensure continuity in story/climate.The story revolves around Noor, Firdaus, and Firdaus' overwhelming mother Hazrat.  Noor (Aditya) and Firdaus (Katrina) are simply cold.  And Hazrat (Tabu) seems to be in continuation mode from Haider.  Aditi Rao Haideri impresses a little bit, all the others (lead characters included) disappoint big time.  Ajay Devgan in a cameo is completely wasted.  The Indianization of the English novel too did not work out well.Overall: a wasted opportunity.  A waste of time (and money) for the viewers.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
