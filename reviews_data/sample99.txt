  Watchable for the energy that visuals can add to the upbeat, festive music. Else, very passable.Sports, dance, music – change the art form around as much as you like, the underdog story is very likely going to stay the same. The underdog will win against all odds. At the most, they will meet an unlikely failure. Even so, by and large the movie has only two ways to end. Then it all boils down to the semantics of the story. How the situations turn around, what the twists are like and so on. While Banjo doesn't seem to have too many surprises under wraps, it still looks like it is likely to entertain.It looks like the music has the biggest role to play in that expectation. It has the rhythm to make your heart pace and the energy to make you want to listen to it over and over. Of course, Riteish Deshmukh's conviction is a big plus too. However, Nargis Fakhri's attempts to act, the drama that goes along side any underdog film, the dialogue-baazi, the inspirational talk all make you cringe. So do some of the jokes. On the other hand there are other one-liners that work and bring a smile. I'd call that a fairly balanced trailer, with a slight tilt towards likable.Music Reviews:

  Banjo is the regular underdog drama, in the music sphere. It is even below average in its story arc, setup-build up-climax and so on. But, it makes up with its music. Now, can one watch a movie for the energetic visuals of songs (about 20 minutes of screen time)? I guess almost all of us will have the same answer.Now, for any film that is about a slum-dweller wanting to make it big, we know how the story is going to progress. We aren't really expecting any great deviations from the norm. Banjo's unpredictability unfortunately comes from the fact that the expected takes too long to happen. The first half hardly moves. We know Chris (Nargis Fakhri) is looking for Tarrat (Riteish Deshmukh) from the trailers to participate in a music competition. She just keeps looking for a long, long time. The digressions in the form of their love story or Chris/Tarrat's jobs or Tarrat's relationship with his band-mates all are rather lacklustre. In addition, some of them slow the pace down further. Almost all of the handful of funny lines are seen in the trailer. So, there is nothing to look forward to there either. For a flash of a moment, when a newspaper delivery boy aspires to be a water tanker owner or when Tarrat expresses the kind of love he is capable of, you are hopeful for more moments of decent writing. But, naah, nothing of the sort happens. Instead the film is littered with scenes like Mumbai dwellers ogling at women in short dresses and men in ties with equal enthusiasm - as if they've never seen either before, Riteish Deshmukh beating people up and so on. There isn't anything very moving or engaging in the acting department either. Riteish Deshmukh does the drunk bit, the macho beating up goon bit, the love-struck bit in rhythm – one after the other. While performances by the other band members are full of energy, Nargis Fakhri loses you at her dialogue delivery itself. It is painful to watch her speak Hindi. And for all the hue and cry about creating music together, her character has all of three lines to sing. Which brings us back to the the gaping hole in the writing department. It is not about plausibility or loopholes, that discussion can come only later - only after there is some meat in the plot, the situations, the scenes. I can't but admit that I am a tad disappointed. This music deserved a better film. For a film that wants to glorify the banjo, it is disappointing to see the banjo player set aside the instrument to dance within a few seconds of its introduction. The flip side is that when you hear the instrument play, complete justice is done to the music it can create.

        ...Banjo is an entertaining film with a heart. You see how difficult life is for a large section of our population-the daily fight for basic necessities-water, shelter, education came through to you subtly. It is a celebration of street culture and music that may be looked down upon in a fancy nightclub but that strikes a chord with the masses as they dance at festivals like it’s a big open air disco. You won’t be disappointed with this movie and next time even join in a visarjan procession and dance to the beats of a banjo band.

And it is unpardonable when a movie gets boring. Riteish Deshmukh is in great form and gives it his all, but the movie itself stretches on for 20 minutes too long. Having said that, the director Ravi Jadhav has a good track record and Banjo should be considered nothing more than a temporary setback. We would be interested in seeing what he does next.

The underdog story is a proven winner in cinema, but this movie just misses the right note.

Aman93deep:
          #Banjo is a must watch, Music is average but the sound of Banjo(an instrument) will make you want more. 3 stars #reviews

Sethumadhavan:
          #Banjo-The music is a plus & Riteish Deshmukh does well but overall very predictable fare.
        
Revolution_A:
          Banjo(2016), watch the movie only for Ritesh Deshmukh's acting. He is at his best. #BanjoMovie
        
girishjohar:
          Saw #Banjo... only relief & good is @Riteishd ... music is below avg...moments are far n few ...loooong too
        
bizzarebhide:
          Riteish Deshmukh is the ONLY good thing about this film. #Banjo

urs_crazyking:
          Lack of Banjo was music if music is not good how musical movie will b.
Liked @Riteishd as always True rockstar
And my big brother #dharmesh
        
t2telegraph:
          Parched is a universal tale of sisterhood, but Banjo strums the wrong notes #t2reviews

          Baffling why some actors in #bollywood insist on doing bad solo movies when they r meant to be good supporting actors only #banjo
        
RanjanPant:

Gurmatpal:
          #Banjo 1/5
(most boring movie of the year, offers nothing new)
        
dysleksick:
          Life aapko 2 choice deti hai.
Ya to #Banjo dekho,
Ya na dekho.

Go with the 2nd Choice.
Such a poorly scripted movie.
Total waste of money.

: Banjo Movie Review – Riteish Deshmukh, Nargis Fakhri Musical Drama
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.That sets the movie apart from any other. We know we may not see foreign locales, white sarees and tulips or sunflowers or even mustard fields. We will see the actual hard work that an average Indian puts in to survive.I am hoping you would review "Parched" this week@Bibs I hoped so too. However, there were no shows with appropriate timings in theaters close by. :/First hindi movie From RAvi Jadhav thats why i want to watch :)Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.

Parental Guidance:


Violence: A few fist fights
Language: A scene or two with a lot of abusive language
Nudity & Sexual content: A few scenes with the camera gazing at skimpily clad women.
Concept: The rise to stardom of a local band
General Look and Feel: The songs are picturized in a way that add energy. These stand out in the otherwise ordinary set-up of a slum.
