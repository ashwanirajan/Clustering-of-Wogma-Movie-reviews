Fact or fiction? You’ll ask yourself this question again and again throughout this movie about the cover-ups in US-Iraq war. If you are a conspiracy theory fanatic (like me) you’d want to believe everything this film has to offer. Its a slow paced drama but is intense in the magnitude of the story. You’d be served with a fiction film based on true facts, in a completely believable setting. Hey, for all we know, it may not be fiction at all (just sayin’). The lead actors in the film are brilliant. Direction by Doug Liman is gripping. Fiction or not, its a movie worth a watch on DVD.Fair Game is inspired by the true events in the life of Valerie Plame. Though, how much of the movie is fact or fiction, is open for discussion, it gives the story a lot of juice. With Wiki-Leaks exposing many a cover-ups of the government agencies, the timing of Fair Game has been perfect. It exposes the controversial actions taken by the US government during the US-Iraq war.

I’ve been a big fan of Frederick Forsyth’s novels. He takes an incident or a political scandal and weaves a perfectly believable and entertaining piece of fiction around it. Though his novels have much more action and are quite fast paced as compared to this movie, Fair Game possesses the same blueprints of an entertainer.
Doug Liman has provided us with some very entertaining spy-action films like the Bourne series and Mr. & Mrs. Smith. But though the tag line of Fair Game reads - ‘Wife. Mother. Spy’, it is not an action film. If not more, they’ve given equal footage to her being a wife and mother, as they have given to her being a spy. You wont miss the action much though, as the intense drama keeps you hooked. 
Jez Butterworth (screenplay) has done his homework in translating the story of Valerie Plame (Naomi Watts) into an engaging script. Doug Liman’s direction manages to keep you engaged, despite the sluggish pace of the story. The slow pace is required to give the lead actors (Naomi Watts and Sean Penn)  a touch of reality. Their characters grow, coping up to the drastic changes in their lives, and it is shown efficiently owing to their brilliant performances. These two have carried on where they left off in 21 Grams.
If you’re into politics, especially the US-Iraq war, you’d love this movie. And even if you’re not, you can watch this one as pure fiction and love it for the powerful performances by Naomi Watts and Sean Penn. Catch on DVD for sure.

Cast and crew of Dhobi Ghat got added to that of Fair Game by mistake. Corrected it, thanks a ton for pointing it out!Though if Fair Game was made here in India, Aamir Khan would have been my first choice to cast. :)Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
