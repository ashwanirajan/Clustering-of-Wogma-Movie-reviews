Jism 2 does nothing to you. It has no material to invoke any kind of emotion from you. Except maybe for a few unintentional laughs.Sunny Leone - ahem ahemm; 
Sunny Leone saying, "I am a porn star" - snicker snicker; 
Some shoo-shaa about Sunny Leone, her serving the country by hooking up with an international terrorist – ha ha ha. 
I guess even pornography needs some story. From the trailers Jism 2 does promise to be a decent, glorified sex film at the very least.  

But, as with many films that fall in this bracket there is a high chance of a fake bait in the trailer for the people looking for sex in the film and being served only the regular story with good-looking people. The beauty is good-looking people they can't take away. The threesome, Sunny Leone, Arunoday Singh and Randeep Hooda do look good and are in the three main roles, so that's not going anywhere. So, it is mighty clear how I see this film. A promise of steamy scenes that's not going to be fulfilled. But, I do have this little hope of some old spark of a story from the Bhatt camp. Yes, I admit that hope is 'very' little.Good thing though, the music is doing well. Let's hope at least that will keep us entertained in the theater. Though right now all of them look pretty much the same in the song promos. Music Reviews:
Milliblog - "Arko and Mithoon elevate Jism 2 to an appealing level."
Music Aloud – "5.5/10"
dunkdaft - "pales in terms of mysterious, seductive tracks that first part had."
Bollywood Hungama – "3.5/5"
Bollyspice – "3.5/5"
Apun Ka Choice – "4/5"

  One of the most annoying things about films that aren't working for you is the genre switch they tend to make through out the film. Did the writer/director want to make a romantic film? Or was it a thriller they were shooting for? Or was it a psycho's story they were trying to narrate? Or did they wish to comment about the system that we are a part of, which is rotting from the very insides? Or was their intention to have steamy scenes featuring a real-life porn star, trying to see how far they could push the envelope?Jism 2's jerkily shifts from one to another without any attempt at keeping a smooth flow. And this is no directorial/editorial experiment we are talking about. The movie goes about narrating whatever little content it has, with all the time in the world and there is no fast-paced, quirky cuts. It is slow and it is mostly boring. The romance is laden with some mumbo-jumbo philosophy. The thriller doesn't manage to engage you too much despite the potential that a Robin Hood-ish protagonist has. His psychopathic inclinations seem out-of-place because we are not entertained to his life experiences, motivations or perception. A monologue at the end of the film is hardly something to suddenly get us interested. And as far at the steamy scenes go, you've seen pretty much all, if you've seen the trailers. Unless you call heavy-duty heaving a part of body language which contributes to acting, Sunny Leone can't act. She barely has any screen presence in terms of captivating our attention by her presence on screen. Arunoday Singh and Randeep Hooda try their best to emote, but this is just the wrong film. And whatever they do ultimately feels like they are overdoing it. Everything in frame looks just so fake and forced. The emotions, the relationships, the connections, the attractions, the power, the anger, the helplessness. Then you are left with hollow dialogue to fill you in with what might be happening. And that is exactly what the words sound like even they seem like they are trying to make some profound sense. At other times it is just inane. On the other hand, I wasn't expecting much from the film either, so it was just a question of sitting through it and waiting for the slow proceeds to be done with.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.A terrorist is on the loose. The only way to get to him is to have his ex-girlfriend reach out to him and get vital information from him. Whatever.A terrorist is on the loose. The only way to get to him is to have his ex-girlfriend reach out to him and get vital information from him. Whatever.
The way Aayan (Arunoday Singh) hugs Izna (Sunny Leone)
The dark blue interiors of Kabir's (Randeep Hooda) house. Even though the slick, crisp look doesn't seem the most appropriate for a terrorist in hiding. It's just convenient

Sunny Leone's wardrobe. Seemed ill-fitting at most times. 
A whole list of other things which are just way too long to be listed here. You can pretty much say everything else about the film didn't work.
bad movie with no story, poor casting and definitely not suitable for children. for more details visit www.bollywood4family.comA pathetic excuse for a movie.The movie was not that bad! I sorta liked! That's natural! Sunny Leone doesn't know the ABC of acting. So, how can we expect to perform extra-ordinary!? I watched it at Wave Cinemas, Ludhiana and the audio system was quite cool!@Filmystan :)@Sanya yeah, but because the expectations are low can't make me like non-acting. :)Direction: 0    Story: 0    Lead Actors: 2    Character Artists: 0    Dialogues: 0    Screenplay: 0    Music Director: 1    Lyrics: 1The movie did nothing at all for me and Sunny Leone's expressions couldn't get any impassive. And at times when the dialogues were actually supposed to be sounding dark, i seriously ended up in fits of laughter. Hooda and arunoday singh did quite a decent job though.It has no material to invoke any kind of emotion from you.
