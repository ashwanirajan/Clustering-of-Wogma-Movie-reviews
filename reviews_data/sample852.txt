
wogma rating: Watch if you have nothing better to do (?)
Mediocre lines are converted to lame by some awful timing and some rock-solid misdirection. Save a couple of interesting characters performed well, there's nothing at all watchable in this 150-minute ordeal.No one can be blamed if they look for a theme when they are out to watch a Madhur Bhandarkar film. So here's the million-dollar question - what do you think is the theme of the Dil Toh Baccha Hai Ji, here's a trailer to help with your guesses. 
 
Men ogling at women with plenty of thought bubbles at their disposal.  snicker
Nastiness aside, there seems to be an office environment but I seriously doubt the setting has anything to do with the three male leads hit by love. It actually will be refreshing to see Madhur Bhandarkar try a rom-com. And if the following snippets from the trailer are anything to go by, it looks like there will be a light and breezy com and the rom won't be a disgusting mush. 
 
What is also highlighted is that the woman don't look like they'll have much to do and whatever they do only highlights that they are awful actors. Which also means the need for crisp dialogues is even stronger. The promos do give a glimpse of decent writing. As in, we sort-of know what the three men are like. Or at least we can take a fair guess on what their ideas about love, sex, marriage and everything that goes along are likely to be. 
Just the kind of movie that could be full of clichés and yet has the potential to keep that smile on while it lasts. 
Music reviews:
milliblog - "Peppy, enjoyable score from Pritam."
music aloud - "Though the soundtrack lacks a song that matches the class of the song the movie borrowed its title from, Pritam produces an engaging fare for Dil To Bachcha Hai Ji."

  The heart - it is allowed to behave like a child; especially when it's in lhhove and all. But what is unacceptable is to allow a kid - however grown-up he might be - to write a full-length feature film. The situations are amateur and the play on words is childish. If you are not convinced of the low standards of story and dialogue writing in the first two hours, watch out (if you are going to watch that is) for the down-market climax.

Within the first few minutes of the film, the three lead characters and their problems are presented to you. This is done as plainly and as non-creatively as possible - which is true of the rest of the narrative too. It is literally Ajay Devgn's love story - cut - Omi Vaidya's love story - cut - Emraan Hashmi's love story - cut - repeat. Within the first few rounds, you can predict where the next cut in the story is going to take you. To the next of the three characters and whatever he is upto next. 
Only that, whatever is happening in his life next is pretty much similar to what happened last. Ajay Devgn is the clueless, middle-aged boss falling helplessly in love with a girl almost half his age. And he keeps falling in love. There's nothing out of this world that this actor is required to do. Emraan Hashmi (they call him Abby) is the playboy -- surprise! -- who is always thinking of the next girl to take to bed. Even when he likes one more than the others, it seems like he has only one aim in mind. A been-there-done-that for him too. Omi Vaidya (Milind Kelkar) is a simpleton and proud of it. Once he falls in love he lets the woman take him for a ride. Again and again. Omi's performance was almost a repeat of his 3 Idiots character. Also his timing is completely off. He actually had a couple of good lines which are completely given away by the way he said them
Now apart from these repetitions, there was this constant nag. I am rooting for no one. Not even the good-natured, squeaky-clean-at-heart, aawww-so-sweet-that-he's-boring Milind. And I think a lot of it had to do with timing. Maybe just maybe, the lame lines I was complaining about might have been tolerable if they were delivered as quickly as a comedy requires them to be. An extra pause here, a moment of thought there puts an ailing dialogue to sleep. 
In the midst of some dreadful writing, it is disproportionately refreshing to see some sort-of variety in character for a couple of the women in the film. Not that the details are deeply thought through, but since they are performed reasonably well, they provided some relief in the otherwise plain narrative. Tisca Chopra as the woman going through mid-life crisis and Shraddha Das as the woman who can misuse people around her were the only source of relief - the characters as much as the actors themselves. 
On the other hand, Shruti Hassan has the flattest dialogue delivery ever and it got too damn annoying even if it was a smaller role compared to the others. And it is difficult to judge if Shazahn Padamsee can act if all she has to do is chirp, "please please please please please." Sure, her character requires her to do that, so we will save judgment until she gets some real dialogue. 
And what's with Madhur Bhandarkar paying a tribute to all his films? Just when you are wondering if a glimpse from Page 3 and Corporate are coincidental, you witness a ramp walk and a jail is thrown in too. Sure, his attempt is not as in the face as other self-referencing directors manage. And though it does sort-of weave in and out of the film, it is still distracting. Oh yeah, and there is the trademark referencing to homosexuality too. But this time around its really shoddy and stereotypical.
Madhur Bhandarkar's trial at exposing the big-bad world of love turned out to be a 75-minute wait for the interval followed by another 75-minute wait for it to end. You don't care how, you don't care why, all you care about is when.

          CNBCTV18 Weekend:Beautiful People:Madhur Bhandarkar. 'Dil to Bacha Hai Ji' - laboured laughter & insights into male psyche not meaningful.
        
anu91178:
          'Dil to bachcha hai ji' is an average at the best. Too long and very less humour.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Three single men fall in love. Each one of them is aiming for something out of their league. Do they get what they want? Is it a happy ending?Three single men fall in love. Each one of them is aiming for something out of their league. Do they get what they want? Is it a happy ending?
Shraddha Das' dress in her first scene.

Awful acting by the supporting cast
Snide remark about the CWG fiasco. Actually the comment was good but it was said way-too plainly.
Make-up was overall bad!
The Kasab joke was absolutely bad taste in humor. 
Omi Vaidya's Marathi!
The interval break. Some real amateur work on the shot that announces the interval.
What was new about Ajay Devgn's new look?
I kind of knew it :)The last two lines more or less convinced me not to watch this. Thanks, as always, for saving my  money and time.@Swetha :P@Kalyan glad to be of help!Agar Facebook nahi hota to Anu's life(Emraan's girl friend) would have been saved. Internet now needs a personal lock and key. What do the others say?Ha ha! I'm sure Anu would have found something else to occupy herself :Dumm just want to say its also nice movie, watch n enjoy.I am sure that something would have been something truly personalized so that people like Emraan could not get to see her status and catch upon her at the veterinarian's place. What do the others say?I think its a different and nice movie really like the acting of Ajay devgan.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
