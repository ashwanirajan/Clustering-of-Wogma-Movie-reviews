I can care for a character if there's both good and evil within him/her. If I don't see the evil side, it scares me. If don't see the good side, what's my motivation to care? Shaitan doesn't explore any fights within, it's just one devil versus the other. If it weren't for the brilliant performances, Shaitan would look like it's Director, Bejoy nambiar and producer, Anurag Kashyap's urge to sew plainly written scenes with quirky treatments."There's a dark side in all of us", sounds so Dexter-y. But, that's what Shaitan's arresting posters are trying to say too. Considering how interesting the poster is, the trailer is a bummer. 


Fortunately the synopsis on the official site makes all the right noises. Director, Bejoy Nambiar claims that the film will talk about pertinent issues without sermonizing but instead promises entertainment. I'm alright if it doesn't entertain and just tells a simple, engaging story. But I sure hope he sticks to the "without sermonizing" part. 
He also mentions a "real and raw" film. Raw is really exciting - be it emotion or texture of the film. The website and the promos are all about "face your inner shaitan". It'll be really cool if we some characters recognize, ackowledge and deal with the devil inside them, their raw self, so to speak.
Besides all of that, any film that has the Anurag Kashyap name attached to it goes high up on my "look forward to" list. Meanwhile, the music already seems to have pleased enough people, even if they don't think it's the best. 
Music reviews:
milliblog - "dizzying, eclectic, indulgent and occasionally overdone."
music aloud - "7.25/10"
Bollywood Hungama - "2.5/5"
HappySing - "For now, I declare the experiment successful."

  If there is only evil within you, there is nothing for you to struggle against. If you have no dilemmas, no internal conquests to make, you don't make interesting characters. If your characters don't interest me, I'm an audience tapping my feet, waiting for something unpredictable to happen. If you don't make anything unpredictable happen, I can only be awed so much by your slick cinematography, smart editing and pulsing background music. The point is there's an attempt to make the same point about our degenerating youth, in a different way. But style gets more than its share, and the dry runs of trying to shock, fail.

And yet just the performances make this film worth a watch. It makes you sit up and take notice. All of them from a short role by Raj Kumar Yadav to the main characters played by Shiv Pandit, Gulshan Devaiya, Kirti Kulhari, Neil Bhoopalam, and of course Rajeev Khandelwal. We always knew Kalki Koechlincan play the doped out, girl-woman. Here you see another facet. The one with perfect comic timing. Sure, she has some awesome one-liners. And her character has a sense of humor darker than mine (yes, I have an inflated opinion about my dark sense of humor). Kalki takes being an insensitive bitch to the next level.
And that's the best the writers do. The odd one-liner. Where's the depth that will engross you in the characters? The twists that will make you sit on the edge? 
There's a quip in my native language, marwadi, which translates to - Don't you trust your fate/luck? Usually used when someone's eating as if there's no tomorrow. Looks like director, Bejoy Nambiar doesn't trust his fate. Which is why he put in everything he thought is quirky in this one film - whether it belonged or not0. Lest he didn't get another chance. One example, Amy's (Kalki) excuse for being cold is shown to us in a fairy-tale like atmosphere. That just doesn't fit in with the otherwise morbid story-telling. Maybe this was just wrong judgment. Everyone is allowed a few of those.
But there are more such examples. Dark characters find themselves in a spot that couldn't possibly get tighter. At this point, Bejoy breaks the fourth wall, has a character talk to the camera and have text superimposed on the screen!? Totally rocks the boat you've settled yourself in. 
Maybe, just maybe, this was intentional. Maybe the characters have lost their marbles and can't think straight anymore. Maybe, the youth that Bejoy seems to be commenting on is so beyond redemption that they can only find comedy in the great tragedy they have created. I'd have given that benefit of doubt if the rest of the writing supported it. Can killing someone by accident make you callous enough to kill at will?
Without a doubt, the situation that Khoya Khoya Chand is set to is brilliantly edited. And for once I liked the use of slow motion in a song (ahem!). Yet, it looked more like a part of Bejoy's showreel rather than his Shaitan.
Yes, each one of us has a devil that has made us its home. Yes, we need to fight it constantly to make this world livable. Yes, it's a beautiful concept that needs to be explored in Hindi cinema. Yes, it remains so.

A movie that reeks of hedonism, debauchery and gross excesses as an everyday part of life is bound to go down the tried and tested way of showing a few sexual connotations down and about, but there’s none. This is the most sexless movie I have seen this year....

          Is Shaitan really such a cult film? I think not. An average film among a crop of terrible ones. #Shaitan
        
shreyasighosh:
          Shaitan? Okay. Drags a little in the end. The "Khoya Khoya Chaand" sequence is brilliant. But Rajeev Khandelwal is just WOW.

anantha:
          Shaitan did not work for me at all. Sure it was "bold", "provocative" & all that. But somehow having seen Paanch, this was nothing special.
        
Abhishek8041:
          In his quest to emulate #Anuragkashyap Bejoy has tried to make a dark artistic movie, but has forgotten to put a soul in it #Shaitan
        
abhamv:
          Watched Shaitan. Didn't really blow my mind as I had expected it to.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.The music (apart from that track by "Bhayanak Maut") is quite enjoyable. And as you say, if it's got Anurag Kashyap it can't be bad.**fingers crossed**We always knew Kalki Koechlincan play the doped out, girl-woman.well said.... Meetu i liked this part.You are absolutely correct the plot never displayed anything intriguing than the spoiled brats...taking down the streets...reminds me of dev d.Frankly speaking i went only for the sex scenes which was neither good or titillating enough.You know people have different mindset for seeing a particular film.I won't write anymore because Your review is exactly  to my verdict.You really wrote the review according to your perception unlike most of the critics who easily get drool away with name and fame.Keep going Meetu.Thanks Guddu! What made you think there were "sex" scenes? Which "sex" scenes were there?IT'S BEEN WHILE SINCE I SAW AN ADULT RATED MOVIE.WHEN I FIRST SAW THE TRAILER.KALKI GOING AROUND KISSING ANOTHER GIRL RAISED MY EXPECTATIONS TO SEE IT FOR ITS SEX NUANCE.BUT AFTER WATCHING IT I UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S A RESEMBLANCE TO AN EARLIER MOVIE PAANCH WHICH WAS CENSORED FOR IT'S VIOLENCE AND NOT SEX AND I WAS FOOLED.@guddu ads! they lie all the time, don't they?@Vishal that's one way of looking at it.Interested in acting/modeling/direction???Upload your portfolio on to Tumbhi.com.You could have a chance to get mentored by Anurag Kashyap.I agree with you. I too thought the end was absurd & abrupt. They tried to make the end look different but it wasn't somehow fitting with the movie. I thought the end was faster than the speed of the rest of the movie. Don't know how to put into words.Also, yes, they've put all they could in the movie which was weird. They didn't even mention the real reason of the inspector's divorce. [comment edited because it gives the movie away]Music, edits and performances were great! :)@someone_talked_of10 awesome way of putting in your thoughts. Thanks!@Nishchal ouch! hmmm...don't quite agree that movies have the power to make us do anything we don't want to do.@Anu :D thanks! well, i thought they gave us a sufficient glimpse of why the divorce was happening, and not everything needs to be explicitly said.comment Totally agree.
