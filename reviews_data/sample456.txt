wogma rating: Add to 'must watch' list (?) - Either way, it makes for a breezy watch
    
  Ayan Mukerji’s Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani delivers what it promises – entertainment that refrains from being idiotic. Not nearly as charming or honest as Wake Up Sid, YJHD is the kind of film you wouldn’t mind watching despite the fact that there isn’t much in the film that is memorable. With a cast that will win your heart and music that’ll play on loop in your head for a while after, the film is fun but rarely much more.First frame of Ranbir Kapoor dancing to 'badtameez dil' and I was sold. Yes, the tune is peppy, the moves are awesome. But in addition, there it has this irresistible energy that hooked me in and just won't let go. Interestingly, there aren't too many dialogue promos out and yet the first impression has been enough to get me excited about watching it.It may be because we know Ranbir Kapoor chooses great films. Or maybe because the last time Dharma Productions and director, Ayan Mukerji got together we had an awesome Wake Up! Sid. Or maybe because there is so little we know about the film that it is exciting. All we know is it is a love story. And there is that little problem with love stories. They have to completely rely on the details - the dialogue, situations, characters and relationship. There is very little wiggle room in terms of concept or plot. I am slightly apprehensive about that because you have a bespectacled, geeky Deepika Padukone suddenly dancing in snazzy outfits.  But, then again Ayan Mukerji has shown us his competence with his debut, so there is enough hope to hang on to. And of course there are the other actors - Deepika Padukone, Kalki Koechlin, Aditya Roy Kapoor - all of whom are so capable of giving wonderful performances. And ahemmm...well, the rarest of rare occasions when I not only mention but also look forward to the item number - Madhur Dixit dancing, it is inevitable!They'll have to botch the story and the details really bad for me to not like this one.
Also, I will be out of town, far far away from theaters and internet connection on May 31st when the film releases. But, there will be a wogma review for sure. Pradeep has been kind enough to review the film for me, while I'm gone.Music Reviews:
Bollyspice - "4/5"

  *I am out on a vacation. Pradeep has been kind enough to review the film for wogma. So here goes...    ~ meetu* ----------------------------------------------In 2009, a young 26-year old’s debut directorial film won hearts because of how fresh and real it seemed (by ‘commercial film’ standards, of course) especially considering that it came from Dharma, who’ve never truly been associated with anything ‘real’ as far as cinema is concerned. Wake Up Sid has since gone on to become a bit of a cult film; its male lead going on to achieve superstardom not just on the strength of his genes, but also because of some terrific performances that have only gotten better with every passing film.Naturally, expectations from Ayan Mukerji’s sophomore effort, Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani, were bound to pile up. I, for one, corrected my expectations after the first promo was out. It seemed that Mukerji decided to forsake some of the freshness and realism from Wake Up Sid in favour of a bit more, if I may say it, ‘masala’. That initial bit of correction helped me immensely, because my instinct about the film turned out to be quite close to how the film is.Stuck in limbo between the realism (or as much of it one can spike into a ‘commercial’ film) and the usual larger-than-life-ness one usually associates with Karan Johar (think Student Of The Year), Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani (YJHD) is an easy, fun-enough watch for the most, largely due to its continuously vibrant feel, a highly competent lead and supporting cast, and its music, which straddles peppiness and flavor with ease. Episodic in nature, YJHD introduces us to Naina, a young medical student who is in a state of flux because she feels she just doesn’t get to have enough fun. A chance encounter with an old school friend makes Naina cross paths with Kabir Thapar, or Bunny, as he is known by his friends. Despite being poles apart, their attraction to each other has ramifications in both their lives, not to mention the lives of their friends Avi (Aditya Roy Kapur) and Aditi (Kalki Koechlin). What surprised me about the film is how it is as much about friendships and relationships that go beyond romance, as it is about the romance between its (quite enchanting) lead pair. Quite like Wake Up Side which had the flavor of romance but was essentially a coming-of-age film, this film too has romance as one of its pillars, but not the only one. It also is a story of strong bonds of friendship that transcend time and space, about the compromises that one has to make in order to make any relationship work, romantic or otherwise. Not surprisingly, it is also, yet again, a coming-of-age tale, something that seems to be a pet subject for Ayan Mukerji. Expectedly, YJHD falters more than once. Every time the film pauses for a moment of genuine, real insight embellished by some cheesy-but-breezy dialogue (penned by Hussain Dalal), you see a spark of what was seen in Wake Up Side. Soon after, though, the film goes back to farfetched situations that would have seemed more at home in a typical film helmed by, say, Karan Johar. This continuous oscillation between the insightful and the ‘filmy’ takes its toll on the film more than one would have liked. Another area where the film really should have been worked on more was in the treatment of the characters. Despite wearing their chalk-and-cheese character sketches on their sleeves, Naina and Bunny in particular often act or react completely out of character. So, while their overall trajectory is always clear to you, their behaviour and traits will often make you wonder why exactly they are like that, when they are actually not supposed to be like that.Despite some rather serious issues in the writing, then, what really makes the film race to the finish line are the performances. Starting from Farookh Sheikh and Tanvi Azmi who barely have a couple of scenes, all the way up to Ranbir Kapoor who expectedly dominates proceedings in terms of screen time, every single actor is worth their weight in gold, as far as this particular film is concerned. The surprise packages are Kalki Koechlin, Aditya Roy Kapur and Deepika Padukone, who infuse such genuine charm, likeability, believability and credibility into their characters that you can’t help but really love them. Ranbir’s performance needs to be considered in context. After two diametrically opposite yet equally intense performances, one could be fooled into thinking that Ranbir could easily ace this character and that he deserves more challenging roles. Yes, YJHD doesn’t challenge him like some of his earlier films, but that doesn’t mean that he doesn’t invest his all into it. Here is someone who gives every character everything he has, and Ranbir gives Bunny the life that he deserves. Also, one can’t but help notice the terrific chemistry of the Ranbir – Deepika pair. They look like they are meant to be together on screen, and the optimist in me believes that they have the potential to become the SRK – Kajol of their generation.Despite some highly contrived song situations, the music of the film, by Pritam, holds its own. Every song is a bit of an audio-visual treat; even the one with Madhuri Dixit in it, despite the terribly underwhelming situation it arrives in. Overall, the songs do play a major role in keeping things going. Badtameez Dil and Balam Pichkari are terrific because of Ranbir and Deepika respectively, while Kabira and Ilahi add soul and texture to the soundtrack.With a run time of 2 hours and 45 minutes and the fact that the film doesn’t really have anything new to say, the film isn’t likely to be universally loved. Still, it is the kind of film you wouldn’t attempt to find too much fault with, because of how it stays clear of getting annoying or overly predictable, even if you largely know which direction you are being led to. Not a particularly bad way to spend a few hours of your life, though I’d take Wake Up Sid over YJHD any day of the week, and twice on a Friday.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.movie have the basic story we have seen earlier,,,,and some melodrama also which makes it litl bit boring and feels lengthy,,,,only the performance and fun moments saves the movie,,,,but doesnt make it good enought to watch it on big screenthe movie is hyped...nothing new in the story or in the treatment...it was mix of DCH, ZNMD,DDLJ.i expected more from ayan mukherjee...movie is strictly averageGood summer flick post the IPL. Mostly clean and tension free. Great cinematography ... Story could've been much tighter. Ranbir and Deepika deliver. Rest of thr cast is average. If you like RK/DP, then definitely watch it in theaters.hmmmm... i felt cheated as I went with high expectatpions ... should also have lowered it after the promos...@ANuP @prashant yeah, I agree.@Amit yeah, they gave the story a miss.@Vishal oh, i liked the promos.Direction: 2    Story: 2    Lead Actors: 2.5    Character Artists: 2    Dialogues: 2    Screenplay: 2    Music Director: 2    Lyrics: 2http://mayahirahasya.blogspot.in/2013/06/yeh-jawani-hai-deewani.htmlYet another bogus,chocolaty melodramatic love story told in true Srk/Kjo style.Perfectly apt for silly young giggling girls who consider Ddlj to be bollywood's greatest films ever made and the likes of Kuch Kuch...and DTPH to be "quality cinema"! Ranbir is the true heir to Srk (fantasy of the college girl kids and middle aged aunties,frustration and agony of us blokes who'v grown up idolizing Amitabh Bachchan and Satya).@Anuj "Ranbir is the true heir to Srk" - except that he can actually act. And you Ranbir grew up idolizing Amitabh Bachchan and Satya, like its a bad thing. :DU mean Srk cannot act!(according to u?) Disagree completely...i can bet this Ranbir boy cannot give a performance half as good as Darr,Swades and Chak De!India...my disliking towards Srk is not because of his acting ability (i think he's jolly good at that),its mainly got to do with his choice of films over the last decade and a half (since Ddlj)One of the few reviews at wogma that I don't agree with.The movie is a total let down... a waste of money and time. The only thing good is songs and dance. Otherwise its a poorly directed attempt with no story and dialogues from a lot of earlier movies.@Anuj yes, according to me. I think he has done way more than that with Barfi and Rockstar already. Decade and a half is a long, long time. On the other hand, I am happy SRK did Chak De! and Swades which were in the last 15 years.Barfi and Rockstar are 2 of the most juvenile,melodramatic and over rated performances in recent times. Imo,the only reason this guy's getting all the attention is 'coz of his surname. A certain Aditya Roy Kapoor has already shown what a tragic love struck male lead looks and acts like with his class act in Aashiqui-2. Rockstar was such a damp squib compared to that!@Anuj I guess we just have to resign to the fact that our definitions of good acting are different. :DAnuj, Adam and the rest: Just so everyone is aware, I'm the author of that review of YJHD. And now that I have some distance between myself and that review, if I read it objectively, I think it is the most balanced review of the film that you can find on the internet. The key flaws have been pointed out, the key strengths have been highlighted, and a larger conclusion in context with the filmmaker's earlier work has also been included.@Pradeep :DCopyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
