Typical action masala. That's all there is to say about it.All I'd have liked to say about Tevar is that it is a typical action masala film. It's up to you what to make of it. If you like the kind of action where story is ancillary and more a matter of convenience than the core of the film, then you will enjoy this one. If not, you won't. It is in fact as simple as that.Given the film's title, by default, every character in the film carries an attitude about them, including the villain's sidekick. Except, except the lead lady. She is one who needs constant protection and taking care of. The tiny bit of attitude that she is allowed to carry for one-tenth of a second is instantaneously over-powered by someone else's attitude. The one-liner boy meets girl story has an extension - boy meets girl when she is running away from a crazy and powerful thus dangerous admirer. You would think that the extension adds just the right amount of salt and pepper to give you a decent film. But, all this is a set-up for the other kind of masala. The one which has random fist and sword fights; some long and some longer chases and a few songs to complete the circle. Though conceptually, the romance seems to be central to the plot, in reality it just feels like a fallback option, "if we don't have them fall in love with each other, what will we do? What will they do?" Fortunately, the actors themselves take their jobs seriously. Arjun Kapoor says his dialogue with a way too much style for my taste, but then that is what the title of the film demands. I like this avatar of Sonakshi Sinha better than her boisterous, loud-mouthed version in this genre of films. What would really be nice though, is she break through to something completely different. We will wait for that film. Manoj Bajpai, as expected, is in complete element as the eccentric, egomaniac, obsessed lover. Unfortunately, it is not because how well the character is written. It is only his doing and commitment to the character. But, it is blatant. It can be considered as a positive - that a film is very aware that it is not trying very hard to tell a story as much as it wants to show some action and that is pretty much its purpose. It doesn't quite work for me though.Which is why, Tevar is one of those. Those who want to like it, will enjoy it come what may. Others can fret and fume all they like.

        ...On the whole, TEVAR is a stylised masala entertainer that'll give you enough reasons to have a good time in the cinema hall. Yes, the story doesn't have anything new to offer, but the wonderful performances, energetic music score, stupendous action and the fact that it's a clean entertainer makes it a fun watch. TEVAR is worth your time. Go for it....

Bajpayee, the effortlessly brilliant actor that he is, plays the baddie perfectly but unfortunately his character ends up being nothing more than a caricature in a pair of jockeys by the time we reach the climax. Sonakshi is competent but she obviously enjoys being trapped in a fragile, bharatiya nari image. So no hope there. Shruti Haasan's item number is uhm…just that....

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Felt like watching R...Rajkumar once again but with a far better villain and a less calibred hero with the same heroine. If you have to watch it then do it for 1.5 reasons.  One reason being Manoj Bajpai who's in superlative form. And 0.5 reason being Raj Babbar who did surprise me in his small role. Barring that it's yet another remake of a brainless South Indian OTT action film.2 and a half day passed and a masala movie starring Arjun Kapoor and Sonakhshi Sinha(countries fav masala movie actress)  which is also a south Indian remake has only got a single comment excluding this one..Looks like not much of persons atleast wogma readers are interested in watching or even talking about it..Same goes for me,,will definitely not watch this on big screen ..Even @Fan's 1.5 reasons doesn't seems sufficient.@Fan more or less agree.@Anup I can understand :P@Anup:That's because Bollywood fans are still recovering from the tornado called PK ;)  325 and still counting!Hi,Tevar seems to be yet another typical masala film which we Indians like very much. Though reading the review, it seems no new stuff, yet the action and drama will do the magic for all the fan girls of Arjun Kapoor.Very nice review, I must say, we are making a lot of films like this, can't complain we Indians have a typical taste in movie.expecting a great plot or good story from these masala Bollywood movies are waste of time. This type of movie are made for only for entertainment aspect.@Amol: agree with your observation.  At the same time I expect producers to feel that the audience are fatigued by this OTT action remake of south Indian films.  South India also gives lots of good content films (non violent type) - just look at the Malayalam industry.  Why can't such films be remade in Hindi?  Producers must stop giving identical films in the hope of cashing in the ongoing trend.
