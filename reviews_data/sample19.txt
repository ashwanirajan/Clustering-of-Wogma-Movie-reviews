You get a ridiculous romance free with an intense revenge drama. Unfortunately, you leave with an after-taste of the silly rom-com instead of the well-written revenge bits. When I heard the title and the cast, I was expecting a film like Bareilly ki Barfi or Shubh Mangal Savdhaan. The first minute or so of the trailer reconfirmed that notion. I was waiting for the traditional family versus couple conflict and hoping for a conflict of a traditional household having objection to an educated daughter-in-law taking up a job or something of that sort. And whammm! I was completely thrown off by what this one presented.Of course, that is only the first reaction. Now, I am just hoping that the character transition isn’t force-fitted or too sudden. I am truly hoping there is some inkling in the exposition or there is a relatively longer transformation. Anyway, looking forward to this one in the hope that it is going to be somewhat different from the ‘runaway bride’, Tanu Weds Manu series.Shaadi Mein Zaroor Aana releases on 10 November, 2017.Music Reviews:

  Shaadi Mein Zaroor Aana gets many nuances of Indian society right to perfection. So much so that it even includes the Hindi film industry’s irreverent melodrama as a part of that society. Only that this bit doesn’t work for the film. It is a complete, disjointed extension to the otherwise well-written, revenge drama the film starts out as. A boy is yelled at by an uncle for teaching his sisters “incorrect values” by asking them to educate themselves further. They are women, education is not really their thing. In a wedding, the otherwise arrogant, aggressive father of the girl, becomes meek and submissive. A married daughter is called a guest in her own parents’ house. These situations made my nerves tense because I have heard them in real-life, some of them were even pointed towards me. While these lines sound dramatic, it is the kind of drama that is seen in real life. While these are some of the overt points the film makes well, the subtleties were rare and refreshing. Shaadi Mein Zaroor Aana does not talk about girls not being allowed to dream. It shows it through the sheer happiness a girl expresses when she gets permission to do a certain thing. She is caught by surprise when she her ambition is supported by the men of her life. This is rightly captured by Kriti Kharbanda’s portrayal of an innocent, restricted woman from the heart of her country. A woman who doesn’t know that her dream of being a government officer is not supposed to be a dream but is her right. The drama is moved forward ably with Rajkummar Rao’s (Sattu) depiction of smitten love and insane wrath. He is gaining screen presence with every film. The entire supporting cast – Govind Namdeo, Manoj Pahwa, Vipin Sharma, the lady who plays Sattu’s mother – perform like they were born in the milieu and have lived those lives. Even the shrill, Nayani Dixit makes us believe her character is this know-it-all whether she is being anxious, announcing doomsday or calming another person down. Shaadi Mein Zaroor Aana doesn’t preach despite being a film that revolves around two social issues – dowry and a woman’s right to education. While risking on a borderline lecture once, these issues are brought about through the story. That it is not brought about overtly dangerously treads coming across as supportive of dowry or against woman’s education. What could be seen as apathy towards the dowry system actually hints at how sad the situation of woman’s education is – the issue related to dowry has becomes secondary and an integral part of the system.  When faced with a situation where a mother-in-law is likely to not be supportive of the daughter-in-law’s rights, the latter is not able to trust her husband and takes a drastic step – that is completely legit given her situation. What could be seen as a comment made in support of dishonour due to a broken engagement, could be a hint at how imbibed the system is that the revenge seems legit too – this I guaged from the hooting and clapping in support of the revenge, in the theater. This is such a gray social situation which is taken as black and white. Not one single person in the story takes a moment to understand why this intelligent woman took an irreversible step. The audience actually cheers when she is made to suffer for it. Even though the otherwise nice man is clearly using inappropriate means to get back to her. Even when the woman is completely trapped from all sides, despite being wronged – the audience cheered. I hope there were others in the audience who that there with clenched teeth like me.Either way, the movie gets you involved. This could so easily have become a social message film and you want to applaud it for not taking that route. But just when you begin to clap, your hands are held back by a ridiculous climax. The last 20-30 minutes of the film nosedives into an abyss and goes deeper and deeper right till the end. It seems the movie (if not the industry) has two types of writers and their skills are not interchangeable. You can either write the regular Hindi film drama or a layered account of characters and society. Just like not everyone can do the latter, looks like one who has accomplished the latter cannot write the ‘masala’ easily either. Stalking isn’t cute. Forcing someone into marriage is hardly romantic. And even if these things were cute and romantic, in some strange world, they make for an awful appendix to close a film, especially a thus-far, well-written film. And in any case, making marriage the be-all and end-all requirement for any couple and thus resolution for a film seems unreal. Especially when you get other snide comments about real-life society right such as men insisting that a woman cover her head with her duppatta (scarf) in a temple. The film peaks and should have stopped at that high. After that, the fall feels like you were betrayed. Or maybe the fall feels worse because of the high you are at. In any case, this one is yet another ‘alas’.

But the treatment is so lackluster that it relegates the movie to Indian soap opera status. It’s a definite letdown. ...

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.‘Boy meets girl’ meets ‘revenge drama’‘Boy meets girl’ meets ‘revenge drama’
Dignity of brass band guys again rang true to life, maybe a snippet of the kind of character he is. 
Some flashbacks show you events that were not shown to you earlier, when those things were happening. 

Sattu spits on Arti’s face in a scene in a romantic song (it’s raining in this particular scene). What was that?! I certainly hope not an innuendo. 
The big reveal in the climax is predictable from a mile
The trailer seems interesting, Will go to watch this movie. thanksNice Movies..
