Bold and brave, yes. Engaging, unfortunately no.Miss Lovely - takes you into a world you can live without going into - the sleazy world of "horror" films that are intended to titillate. A world of two brothers making such films - one who wants to move on to porn films and the other who wants to make a clean, romantic one. It is an uncomfortable ambiance and very intentionally so. Which is fine, only that it overtly tries to go all "art-house" cinema on you.Flitting between showing you the behind-the-scenes of B/C grade films and the inner angst of a crew member whose heart isn't into it, Miss Lovely's writing doesn't do justice to either the plot or its characters. Sure, I admit, I am not the biggest fan of B-C-D grade films, so the theme of the film itself isn't as appealing. On the other hand, I am always ready to travel with a character, whatever its background. But, Miss Lovely, denies me that. And that's more frustratingly than usual because it didn't have to do much to hook me in. It has the most brilliant performances and the setting is as real as it gets. It has quirks that catch you smiling wryly at the dark humor. It is commendable indeed, that with a theme such as the porn world, the movie doesn't get too graphic. Given all of that, I am ready to let go of the typical elements the film engages in - the jealous dying "star", the clamoring of struggling actors who can stoop to any levels to land a role in a film, and so on.What the writing fails to understand is that with a setting that is far removed from our real worlds, it becomes ever so important to engage the viewer either in the narrative or with the characters. One thing that troubles me with films is when the camera gets over-excited. I understand the hand-held jitters bring out the confusion on screen - both apparent and inner, but the impact on me is lost when its overdone. In fact, in this one the hand-held sequences are done with close-ups that ironically distance you from what's going on in the film. That's the root there, the connect - which isn't there. Certainly a downer, for a film that wants you to experience, rather than just superficially know. Yet, you cannot take away from the fact, that it is brave indeed to make a film like Miss Lovely.

            Nay! Thumbs Down,
            by Anup
: Such a bad screenplay
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.I wonder if I'd like this movie better than you did, Meetu - though I suspect most of my US Indian cinema fans wouldn't enjoy it, either. As a fan of low-budget/schlock movies, a behind-the-scenes look at how they're done in India would probably really appeal to me if it's remotely accurate. Might be worth a rental.This is a brilliant cinematic piece of art! A realistic dark & disturbing movie which despite making u depressed and sick,will definitely give u something to ponder over. Much unlike "dumbed down" versions of art cinema like Dedh Ishqiya and Dhobi Ghat! And even though this one's gonna flop,it ain't making a difference since its hardly got any investment riding on it.@TimELiebe Give it a shot. It's very different from your regular *masala* :)Last Year’s most famous non commercial low budget movies are THE LUNCHBOX , SHAHID AND BA PASS.....Among these The lunchbox was awsome and Shahid was just behund awsome,,,,,for BA PASS its so so but was not a bore.....Miss lovely also falls in the same cataogory,,,,but for me the movie doesnt give me a single moment for not being bored,,,,such a bad screenplay,,,,its doesnt creat any curiousness in mind to think what will happen next....Just for siddique’s performance this movie is cant be watched@Anup - thank you for the quick list of "art house hits" this year. We're definitely going to try THE LUNCHBOX, because it sounds like the kind of "small" movie we Americans would enjoy.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.

Parental Guidance:


Violence: A prison inmate being beaten up by the police and scenes implying that a person was beaten up real bad.
Language: Lots of abusive language
Nudity & Sexual content: The film is about porn films. So, lots of sleaze even if explicit content isn't all out there.
Concept: Behind the scenes of the Hindi porn/sex-horror film industry in the 80s.
General Look and Feel: Gritty and grim.
