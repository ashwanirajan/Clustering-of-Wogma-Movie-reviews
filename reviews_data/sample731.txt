For a slapstick that is supposed to keep you in splits, Rascals has a very few gags that would have worked better if they were told in a calmer tone, with better timing and weren't dragged endlessly.Rascals, another swear word becomes a movie title. Another loud, brash, mash-up of sms jokes becomes a film. Another David Dhawan film is knocking at theaters.It's sad that it's possible that half those jokes, especially the self-referencing movie scene, would work. But the dialogue delivery is so loud and the comic timing, slightly off, that the jokes wore me out in just these 2.5 minutes. Not to mention screechy Kangna Ranaut. 
This is especially disappointing (yep! Just from the trailer) because Sanjay Dutt and Ajay Devgn do have a flair for comedy and have managed to bring out bouts of laughter in the past. But here even some of the half-decent lines seem to be falling flat. Let's just hope that in the flow of the film, the wisecracks will work better. 
However, there doesn't seem to be anything to look forward in the story either. Yeah, yeah, I know we are talking about a typical David Dhawan film here. But sometimes, in such slapstick comedy, the situations that characters get into create humor. Here it seems like just the same old, two good-for-nothings playing a game of One-upmanship and lying their way to woo a dimwit lass who is supposedly very ... hot(?). And of course, there's a villain thrown in for kicks. 
I really don't expect to enjoy this one. Let's just hope there are a couple of gags and situations here and there that will bring a laugh or two. And let us hope the timing is better than in the trailer. Meanwhile, the music doesn't seem to have appealed to anyone.

  Rascals' main aim seems to demean and mock. You know, the kind of jokes that are cracked on the less fortunate and are politically incorrect - be it the poor or the blind. The other kind of humor involves guys ogling at cleavage - what is that actually supposed to do? Make you laugh, titillate you, warm you up to the owner of the cleavage?

Speaking of which, my hands started hurting with the number of times Kangna Ranaut is pulled from Sanjay Dutt by Ajay Devgn only to be pulled right back by Sanjay Dutt. Imagine the number of times they must've done that while shooting those pulling-and-pushing scenes. 
And the forced hugs that Kangna Ranaut gets from Sanjay Dutt and Ajay Devgn after she is pulled makes the two heroes of the film look like lecherous, sleazy, old men that any woman would avoid with a barge pole. 
Why then is she tolerating this nonsense? There's a reason for it all, supposedly. A reason that only makes you wonder, "Really? There was no other way to get to the two fools now, was there?" Oh sorry, how would the writers be able to write all the skin-show and other rubbish in? And well, it is only me who can complain about missing logic and question supposedly existing logic in a David Dhawan film. 
Like any other David Dhawan film, Rascals made me laugh once or twice. It also immediately took the fun away by characters explaining the joke just cracked or stretching it for an extra 5-10 seconds. And that can be said about the film too. You think it's over and there comes more and then some more and then finally the closing credit song. 
And you know the scary bit? There seems to be a hint at a sequel.
