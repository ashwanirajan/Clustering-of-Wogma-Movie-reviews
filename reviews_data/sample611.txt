Not every case might be a 'Jessica Lal' murder case, which can be repealed by the gusto of the 'aam junta' and one determined news lady. Not everything might come to culmination as easily as is shown in the second half of No One Killed Jessica. But the film gives us, what we need most - the strength to fight our fights and the hope that we will get what we deserved all along - justice.The turning over off the verdict of the Jessica Lal Muder case to give a life-time imprisonment sentence to a well-connected accused, is a precedent of the power of media, should they decide to use it. Dramatizing it with a strong cast and making it into a Hindi film is the need of the hour, if not anything else. The number of scams that 2010 saw makes a film showcasing the power of the audience, a necessary welcome to 2011. 
The trailer makes you look forward to a crisp and strong film. 
 
I'm hoping it's not just a cursory glance at the case, the low court acquittal, the uproar, the supreme court sentence but is a deeper read into who said what, etc. The media/citizen uproar and the sting operation are specific parts that I'm hoping will inspire us one and all. 
With music composed by Amit Trivedi and the 'right' snippets in the trailer the initial audience is likely to hit theaters. And this despite the fact that the story is known to anyone who is interested. I'm also hoping the film will also reach out to the people who aren't aware of the details. 
The question now is - are the parts that didn't make it to the trailer good enough for us to recommend it to family and friends.

milliblog  has given it a 200 word review instead of their regular 100-worder. That says it all!
music aloud - "9/10"
Bollyspice - "Ultimately, an album certainly worth checking out! Or 3.5/5"
Bollywood Hungama - "This has to be one of the most prestigious outings for Amit Trivedi as he brings in certain maturity in the way he deals with the soundtrack here. Or 3/5"
Hindustan Times - "fails to contain a cohesive sound and is rather mediocre."

  Whatever you can expect from a film with - an attention grabbing promo; based on a newspaper story that is close to home for one and all of us; directed by the person who made a strong statement with his debut, Aamir; AND aspires to be a commercial success - is delivered.  It's entertaining, it makes its point and it reaches out to us. Then, even if the film simplifies the struggle that the common man has to go through to get his basic right, it feels like it is only so that we keep our hopes strong in this age of a scam a day.

Of course, the state of affairs we live in is disturbing beyond measure. So much so that, we applaud something that should be taken for granted - honest bureaucrats, police, and politicians. As the 'aitbaar' song in the film goes - trust is melting away. 
Thankfully, there are cases like these to restore that faith to however small an extent. And thankfully, there are people in the film industry who can and are willing to make such films to serve as reminders. 
They also have selected a brilliant team, which brings to screen situations the way that we might have visualized them when we read the newspapers. And more. The story has a good measure of details that are not necessarily known to people who haven't keenly followed the case. The narrative is also kept interesting with the non-linear references to Sabrina's relationship with her sister. 
The performances only add to what already is an interesting setup. You love the bitch in Mira (Rani Mukherjee) and the cow in Sabrina (Vidya Balan). You get into their story more because of the bit roles played by a reasonably well-staffed supporting cast. 
The earnest but dumb, junior journalist Aditi (Maanvi Gagroo) is funny because of the situation she is put in. I loved the way Aditi's side-story subtly shows how Mira makes up to her. The submissive, clueless, simple middle class man, Sanjit Lal (Yogendra Tikku) makes you feel the frustration his daughter Sabrina might have gone through. 
The powerful politician's side-kick is only too proud to "take care" of the witnesses and evidence. And the most impressive was the actor who played inspector (name, anyone?). His role in the case is such a huge finger pointed at the country's administration. 
I could've have done with a little less dramatization, for example entry of the key witness into the courtroom. But, I'd much rather see a commercial success for films like these than cater to my preferences. 
Isn't it commendable, that a film about such a serious issue leaves you in good humor, without taking away anything from the message. A lot of it has to do with the witty dialogue and amusing (or made amusing) situations. Another huge chunk of credit goes to Amit Trivedi (oh, how I have restrained myself from saying 'the one and only'!) His music in combination with Amitabh Bhattacharya's lyrics tell you a lot more than the basic story itself. 
Sure, I would have liked the setup in the first half to have led up to something a little less anti-climactic. Sure, the pace could have been a little better in the first half, which might have made the second half look better. Yet, these seem like mere nitty-gritty when you notice the emotional high that the film has left you with. And especially when you compare it to the huge reminder it is. Of our strength, if only we choose to use it.

Manish's mother coming in with her one-liner repeatedly. Anywhere else, I would have classified it as irritating slapstick, but here it works too damn well. 
On a similar note, the "12 o'clock" thing works really well too. 

Vidya Balan's shower scene - especially because she had her glasses on.
The political thriller, set in New Delhi, was believed to be based on the controversial Jessica Lal murder case. However, later, the director clarified that the title and the script are actually inspired by a headline carried out by The Times Of India in 2006, when the accused in the infamous murder case were acquitted by the lower courts, leading to nationwide protests, reopening of the case and subsequent sentencing of the accused, and not the case per seThe movie is set during the time when entire nation was trying to overcome the firing blazes of the Kargil War. At such a juncture, the nation’s capital witnesses another tragic happening. Jessica, a young attractive celebrity model, tries her hand at bartending. Little did she know that this trial would lead to her death! Reason — her refusal to serve a drink after closing hours! Manu Sharma, son of former Union Minister Vinod Sharma, pulled out the trigger and allegedly murdered Jessica in front of nearly 300 people present at the high-society party. Surprisingly, Manu Sharma was declared innocent by a court in 2006. Here Enter Vidya Balan as Sabrina, Jessica’s sister, and Rani Mukerji as Meera, the feisty TV reporter, who join hands to fight against politics and democracy to outwit Manu and attain justice for the slain Jessica Lal.http://www.bollywoodchaska.com/blogs/293/vidya_balan_rani_mukherjees_girl-566/Unique for Bollywood which is obsessed with romance and songs and love sequences. No romance, no songs and no running around trees this time. NO ONE KILLED JESSICA is a class apart. Its Vidya Balan and Rani Mukherjee who would try and amuse the audiences on their own. No Shahrukh no Aamir.seriously looking forward to the movie but am sceptic whether it will only dramatically emphasise the things we already know or give some more direction to whole Jessica saga ... with media all over the case there is little which is unknown - but its a bold move by the film makers to pick on the subject so quickly .... both female leads are very strong actresses and going from the trailors i hope it is an absolutely in your face movie, however lower expectations!!!The cop was Rajesh Sharma.  You may remember him from Parineeta, Khosla Ka Ghosla or Maachis...Excellent, was looking forward to this one. Will definitely watch it now!I guess I entered a wrong email address previously - was surprised to see I had only posted one comment previously! :PAh! Glad to hear that this movie is good. I just observed that Viday Balan hasn't had a flop in 3 years! Her last three films are Paa, Ishqiya and this and has acted only in one movie per year! In fact, she even won awards for the first two. Impressive lady. Pretty tangential to the post but couldn't resist.Why was a make out scene necessary. Can't they make a movie without one now ?True we all know the story, but I still think they did not build up enough tension in the first half.Nice movie.
