Such a shame that a warm, cushy ambiance with interesting characters don't blend together to make an engaging film. The charm is inescapable, surely. Despite Shah Rukh Khan's character being played by Shah Rukh Khan. But the question is, when does charm become too much? Is it possible to watch 2+ hours of it? We could've blamed Alia Bhatt's cuteness for the OD, but not after Highway and Udta Punjab, right?I am all for romance and the “aawwww” that comes with the honemoon period and the “aawww shucks” that goes with the heartbreak thereafter. But, this one sounds too upbeat even when Alia Bhatt's character asks, “Why are romantic relationships so irritating?” The brightest lining around this skepticism is that these are exactly the thoughts I had when I first saw English Vinglish's teaser. So, fingers crossedMusic Reviews:

  You are writing a letter to life. You start, “Dear Zindagi,” (Dear life). Obviously, you are going to end up philosophizing a lot. And that's exactly what the film does too. It tries to weave that into a story of a young, confused, urban girl. But, we know it is all a metaphor and Dear Zindagi actually wants to talk to you. Ironically, this is where it loses all connect with you. Given Shah Rukh Khan is doing a lot of the pep talk, you'd think the connect is lost because of is all-knowing smirk. It's not. In fact, for most parts you look at him and hear him as Jehangir Khan. And it really is great when this happens. Alia Bhatt too is her usual refreshing self, even when her character is reflecting on the big doses of philosophy being thrown her way. However, the confused, urban girl and her problems are only as interesting as a confused, urban girl's problems can be. Sure, I want her to sort herself out and see her life beyond her problems. But, I don't want to sit with her through her therapy sessions. This is not apathy, it is a  response to jerky screenplay and a protagonist whose problems that I understand but don't engage with.At first glance, you could say you feel the disconnect because Kaira seems to be living a pretty decent life  - good at her work, good friends, romantic attention from the kind of guys she likes. “She has no problem”, you might want to say, “What do I root for?” Herein lies Dear Zindagi's agenda. It is ok for you to be unhappy even if most things are going your way. There is no need to be hard on yourself, it says. It is a noble enough cause, one that propagates  – we ought to be comfortable with ourselves even when we are unhappy. Unfortunately, to make a fictional film, it needs solid characters with an engaging story that binds them together. And to acknowledge that a poor joke is poor or a deep philosophical quote is a too deep, doesn't make either of those less tacky. Kaira's character is totally imaginable as a girl you'd know, the kind who uses her rudeness on her sleeve while it actually is a coping mechanism of sorts. She has her reasons to be that way, but Dear Zindagi shows them to you too late to be able to fit the complicated puzzle that Kaira makes herself out to be. I am glad that we know very little about Jehangir Khan. He's a therapist who seems to know what he is doing. And that is pretty much all we need to know. And the unique chemistry between Kaira and Jehangir is played out well by the two actors too. The disoriented feeling then comes from the breaks into Kaira's life, her friends, etc. It is a little too plain, a little too long, a little too repetitive. A crisper, even if not a more enticing, slice of her life would have had a better impact. Dear Zindagi is one of those very few films that start out drab and pick up steam in the second half. While it is nice to have a well-founded set-up, if it is dull it becomes even more difficult for the story to hook you. It is a shame then that a film that had all the right things to say; that had capable actors to say them the right way; that had characters who could have kept your thoughts from going astray doesn't do it all too well. It is a film different from the norm which by itself wins some points, but  not quite enough.

By moving ahead of romantic relationships, the movie also teaches important life lessons on how to deal with your family and how to bury the baggage of past. The flick is more like a therapy that the modern generation needs today in order to live a stress-free life. It is hard to comment whether it will work wonders in the single screen and rural areas but, if you need some freshness and a break from Bollywood clichés, then straightaway head to a theatre closest to you to grab a slice of 'Dear Zindagi'

But that circumvents the fact that firstly Shinde failed at that communication. She is still the sensitive director who can compose wonderful frames, command her music director and editor's talents, and extract lovely performances from her cast. She can still touch your heart.

        ...Despite the presence of Shah Rukh, there is just no emotional connect with Alia and you want to reach out and say, 'Enough!' to her. They try so hard to 'be cool'. It's not the fault of the young actors at all. Even Ali Zafar, who is perfect as the rebound boyfriend comes across as one-dimensional and easy to dismiss. The story just doesn't have enough meat. It's so Aalia-focussed, there is no room to develop the other characters. They're all there to show how 'kewl' Aalia is.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.@meeta- "In fact, for most parts you look at him and hear him as Jehangir Khan"didnt find anything special with SRK'S performance. He acted same as he reacts in shows like KOFFEE WITH KARAN or KAPIL SHARMA SHOW. Infact the way he scratch his beard , reminded me of his interview , the only diff was that , he was the person asking question this time..The movie had a lot of conversation , which is not exactly a bad thing. I myself is a big fan of BEFORE TRILOGY (before sunrise , before sunset and before midnight)  . But those conversations should have to be interesting.Why English Winglish was such a good film is that it was most relatable to life. But all the Therapy talks in Dear Zindagi were either unrelatable  or things which anybody already knows. Its not atall a must watch film . Not even at home. Can be use for burning time. Not even worth for SRK fans. FAN was better then this. May be a little bit for Alia Fans.This movie can neither satisfy the Intellectual audience neither the commercial audience.Only persons who can relate to this movie are those who are frustrated with their life and don't know what else to do..Dear Zindagi is a 1 woman equivalent of ZNMD. A mushy, juvenile yet enjoyable urban metropolitan film on the issues relating to urban Indians alone.  This is another one of those movies teaching life lessons on juvenile issues usually faced by the rich & the elite metropolitan population of our's for whom failed relationships seem to be the end of the world. Alia does well and SRK's restraint performance provides a refreshing change from his recent misadventures. However, the philosophical talk would not be related to by a vast majority of the audience outside the urban metros.http://thesimplebollywoodreviewer.blogspot.in/2016/11/dear-zindagina-milegi-dobara.htmlA simple story of a young lady and her struggles as she grows up and learns to accept and forgive! Very well written the script and enacted by Alia and Shahrukh. Gauri Shinde shines once again with this one. Here is more nice review of Dear Zindagi which I foundAwesome work done by SRK and Alia in the movie Dear Zondagi. Every song and composition of this movie is Awesome, Checkout all the song and lyrics from http://lyricswish.com/SRK looks much better in this movie than his typical hero looks. Alia is also impressive. Movie is excellent.Alia was impressive in her role and SRK have nowadays changed his image from this movie as well as FAN.SRK rocks. I like this movie, Alia and SRK did a great job. 7/10 from me.After making the immensely likeable and down to earth English Vinglish, this one is a let down of a film.Nothing worse than a person / filmmaker having pretensions of being intellectual and able to do philosophical reflections.  In today's day and age where many people are flooded with philosophical messages each day via Whatsapp, if what you have to offer is not far superior than the whatsapp philosophical message that was deleted instantly then the film also will be deleted from the memory.The film was a bore, characters were horrendous (star power allowed to stay glued to proceedings), story was pathetic, the reasons for Alia's psychological problems were infantile to say the least (seemed contrived and forced to provide the pretext for making the film), other happenings like the dislike for a single working woman in a heavily rich cosmopolitan Mumbai suburb is hallucination.  And the solutions to all these problems, simplest of simple, work overnight and heavily soured relations become sugary sweet in an instant - come on guys just wake up and see how ridiculous the proceedings are.  Worst of all was the performance of the Pakistani import, even in normal avtars he is a massive pain to watch but in this film continuously singing his third grade song, he was simply intolerable.Nothing works at all in this film, only the star power ensures that it gets a few footfalls.For your Dear Zindagi's sake stay far away from it.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
