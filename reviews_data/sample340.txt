
wogma rating: Beg or borrow, but do watch (?)
The worst break-up ever makes for a warm, spirited film. It is always awesome when you start watching a trailer with eyes ready to roll and instead they turn wide with amazement. Kangna Ranaut is actually playing a lively character with such honesty and grace, let alone without screeching. The brilliant bit is that the writing is so good that it is difficult to distinguish if it is Kangna Ranaut or her character who is unpretentious and fresh. The story by itself is something that is intriguing but can go either way - a small-town Indian girl is stranded in Europe on her honeymoon. Though Raj Kumar Yadav doesn't seem to have too big a role in the film, it is great to see him slotted against Kangna Ranaut - an unlikely couple. That along with the fact that the director, Vikas Bahl's co-directed Chillar Party makes me want to look forward to the film. The music is quirky as one has come to expect from Amit Trivedi. Just wondering if my inkling, that the film will match up too, will be right. Music Reviews:
Apun Ka Choice - "4/5"

IBN Live, IANS - "/5"

  You could call Queen a chick-flick, you could call it a coming-of-age film. You could even say it is an apt one to release on "Women's Day" weekend. Bracket it as you like it, but there cannot be enough films made like Queen. And I don't say that because Queen sees its protagonist empower herself from a small-town woman who is put down by all around her to a woman who is willing to find herself. Neither is it because a human being comes into their own despite being down in the dumps, without losing their innocence. Films like Queen should be made for the way the story is narrated. You relate to the protagonist from the word go - and that comes from a person who hates use of voice-over to introduce a film. You are with Queen, a part of her thoughts. You jump with her from thought to thought.  And the best bit - the voice-over stops there. It isn't overdone. Kangna Ranaut's Rani or Queen is innocent and that simplicity engages you instantly. Her character builds and grows ever-so-slowly, yet, you are far from getting bored. In fact, one of those rare films that I didn't want to end. Rani and Kangna weave together so seamlessly, that you cannot tell if you are falling in love with the actor or the character.  And while she (both Rani and Kangna) could have carried the film alone on her fragile shoulders, she is lent great support by the supporting cast and the characters they play. Films like Queen also show you that there are things beyond character and situations and overall plot. It's the details and the traps that you keep yourself from falling into. Tiny things make Queen, the film, even more charming - like how she doesn't let go of her handbag - no, not to the street thug as you see in the trailer - but in a club, while dancing. Also, it was so easy to have let Queen get a makeover and transform herself into a confident, outgoing girl, especially given Kangna Ranaut's glamour quotient. But, they don't take that bait. The character transforms but within a believable boundary. This aspect is so refreshing when you compare it to almost every other hindi film in which characters transform into the exact opposite at the slightest instigation.Given all the things that are right about Queen, the discussion would still be incomplete without a word about the music. Wow. Both, the writing and the performances in movies like Highway and Queen swoon you with surprise. It takes me a long while to get over this lovely feeling of being swept of my feet, especially when least expected. Good thing I am in no rush to come back to ground.

            Yay! Thumbs Up,
            by Suman
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review...keenly waiting for this one...loved all promos ......absolutely loved it ...now eagerly waiting for your verdict ...be ready to fight ...if its anything less than "Must see - Only in big screen"Great, now I really really want to watch this film. Of course, it won't release here so I will have to guiltily download it....feeling like the kid who after getting her marksheet is wondering why teacher gave me 99 ...where I lost that 1 mark..@Divya Believe me, I thought long and hard as to why I don't feel like "Must watch...", but couldn't come up with a reason. Yet, couldn't make myself bump the rating up. :/@Rahul oh so sad, that this film have to be downloaded because of unavailability. Feel worse that happening to films you like :(Hi...Here's a thought: While there are tons of movie review sites to read BEFORE watching a movie, there are hardly any sites that are meant to read AFTER watching a good movie. For Hollywood movies, the IMDB forums are very active, and full of intersting observations. So here's an idea: why don't you start a separate section on your site called 'After Watching the Movie' (Leave it to you to come with a catchy acronym like Wogma). Maybe you can let users contribute a Notepad section!Hi...Here's a thought: While there are tons of movie review sites to read BEFORE watching a movie, there are hardly any sites that are meant to read AFTER watching a good movie.

Crowd-sourcing the notepad section. That could work. Will have to have strict guidelines about how not to keep people from  giving the movie away, right? :P@Anand :D….so when the producers would have decided to back this female oriented story…in an industry where business of a movie largely linked with name of male actor …than story, music or choice of female lead…it was risk…when they would have agreed to go with …a not very conventional sort of conclusion …in an industry where “and they all lived happily ever after” is norm …it was risk.…but a part of audience wants them to take this risk …again …and again. Also due to absence of a big star …usually these movies fail to create ‘enough buzz’….and hence these movies start with a very low occupancy rate… it is expected to increase with critics rating and comment …now for a big star movie ToI rating varies between 3 to 4 stars…irrespective of content …something similar do exist for all hindi newspaper …in addition most movies ‘s print ad do contain critics rating …obviously they pick n choose the better ratings …which is 3 to 4 stars …even pathetic movies will find a weird critic / RJ / blogger who has given good rating …. and hence it is getting increasing difficult for an average movie goer to decide which movie to watch ….and in such scenario she relies on someone…with whom her choices resonate …usually friends, family or some niche web based movie reviewer ……..so if they don’t insist and give a rating that is anything less than 5 stars this average movie goer may or may not decide to watch this movie …depending upon logistics, timing, mood etc….but if they insist that you Must see it on big screen…in all probability …it will be adhered….leading to increased occupancy …which in case will further lead to additional word of mouth …thus ensuring movie does a decent business …ensuring that the risk taken by producer is rewarded …and he is motivated to invest in further such ventures …also giving hope to others to take such risks …with more such projects coming in …there is hope that slowly there will be change in taste of others …and this newly acquired improved taste will then be not only limited to movies but will extend to a general well-being …and …the world will be a better place to live in ……with world peace in your hand… you were not able to find a reason to bump the rating up ;)Thoroughly enjoyed the movie, from start to finish.  This is what happens in real life. I could completely relate to it. But in that scene when Rani comes out running from the bathroom, scared of lizard, I was like....no! not this....don't use this cheap scene. Otherwise totally enjoyable movie. Btw what do you say Heengh in English :)Saw this last week! Loved it. As another reviewer said, you come of the theater thinking about Rani. You wonder what were her life choices in the future? And if she retains the same spark or reverts back to her staid old ways once back in the safety net of Rajouri Garden? And when a movie does that you dont begrudge the £20 spent on tickets and further popcorn and cola expense. A nuanced film in every aspect!@Divya ha ha ha ha ha ha ha... I do need a larger heart, I agree. Loved your comment. @Kapil :P Asafoetida. I wanted to go "me, me, me" with my hand raising up, like a school child who knows the answer :P@Rachit Yay!!Direction: 3.5    Story: 2    Lead Actors: 3.5    Character Artists: 3    Dialogues: 3    Screenplay: 3    Music Director: 2    Lyrics: 2I couldn't find the 'What worked, what didn't for this film' section.
