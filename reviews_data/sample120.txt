A creepy crawl under your skin that goes away because it tries to stay for too long. (gulp) The teaser jolted me. Of course, in two seconds, the effect waned and it felt like a gimmick. And then came along the trailer. (gulp) (gulp) (gulp)What spine-chilling 3 minutes! Though of course I was immediately distracted by OCD traits, hallucinations, grandiose delusions all together being termed as psychopath. Sure, a psychopath could suffer from one or all of the above. However, I cringe at the thought of someone looking at a person with the trait of wacking on alternate steps on a footpath and wondering if they are a psychopath or even worse call him/her – psycho. Despite holding that big one against the trailer, I was completely taken in by the atmosphere, the dialogue, the implication of the dialogue and of course Nawazuddin Siddiqui. So much so that, a hope has risen that even the technical mental disorder will be explained well in the film. Yes, unlikely, but hey, hope is hope.Again, another one that I won't be around for first day. Hopefully, I am a the fag end of a long, tiring Himalayan trek and will be back soon. Maybe I am currently disconnected from all things materialistic, and if I am not, I am sure I one of my top thoughts would be that June brought us 2 super thrillers. (This preview was written in the third week of May and has been auto-published.)

  The teaser was enough to bring an eerie discomfort you would associate with a well-made horror film. Unfortunately for the film and fortunately for the viewers you get comfortable with the discomfort. If it were not for Nawazuddin Siddiqui's spine-chilling performance, Raman Raghav 2.0 wouldn't have had much of an impact. The story by itself barely has any material beyond its one-line plot. The big reveal would either be predicted by seasoned movie-goers or will seem too contrived when it comes about for those who didn't guess it before hand. Either way, it holds no charm or shock despite the fact that the concept by itself is thought provoking. The “psycho” element in this psycho-thriller comes a little too late, even if it is not too little. The rest of the film has no movement, neither is the slow pace arresting. Each sequence functions as an additional proof of how brutal Raman (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) is. It is nerve-wrecking. It is scary. But it goes on for tad too long. Even so, for fans of the actor, the director or the genre, there is enough to keep you in your seats. You might or might not remember much after you leave it though.

Creating a disturbing world full of bloody violence and twisted philosophy is something the auteur filmmaker loves doing. Yes, his stylish approach causes a bit of unneeded confusion in the story he’s trying to tell. But then again, that confusion is something he wants the viewer to feel.
