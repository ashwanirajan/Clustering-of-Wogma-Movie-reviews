Should one appreciate the attempt at story when one wasn't expected or should one complain about lack of the magic that was promised?That Tabu and Parineeti Chopra star in a slapstick comedy bring a kind of shudder. Another kind of shudder induced by the over-the-top histrionics of Prakash Raj and Vrajesh Hirjee. By now, I am totally immune against the main lot - Ajay Devgn, Arshad Warsi, Tusshar Kapoor, Shreyas Talpade, Kunal Khemu and the “Rohit Shetty” action moments. The next layer of shudder-after-shudder come at the things that all people involved in making the film found funny. Advice being given to Ajay Devgn, that it is ok to date a girl much younger. So far, alright, right? The next line goes, “Girls look for father figures in their boyfriends. She has the figure and you are the father.” Say, what? No one on set from the writer to the crew to the cast found that …. uggh? That is an uggh in itself. Oh well...I just might be watching this one in a single screen theater in a small village in Maharashtra. Golmaal Again releases on 20 October, 2017. The review will be out by 21st October.

  Just in case you missed it in the trailer, the movie sends at least three reminder pleas asking you to remember it is not about logic when it is magic. Through the movie you wonder what part of it was expecting to be called magic – the bright, fairy-tale-like, shoddy  computer-generated graphics; the histrionics of a ghost; or the superhuman power that allows for a fourth episode in this series. My mind which, ironically worked a little too hard to let go of logic, could only see the makers attempt at providing logic where none was expected. It is indeed a fair attempt in trying to build a story around ghosts. Unsurprisingly though, it neither makes you laugh nor appreciate the effort. In fact, the writing is often repetitive as the ghost demonstrates its existence or when scenes over-explain. The jokes too are often stretched too far, stifling the smile that had just begun to erupt. A lot of it is also repetitions from the previous editions. And some humor, such as the use of Ku Klux Klan costumes, is completely lost on me. There are other scenes that are  just so silly that you can't help laugh at the silliness - this is the essence of  a Golmaal film, so even if I don't enjoy it I've stopped minding it. But, what we are not used to is the semblance of a plot. As a safety measure, the film even throws in a couple of social messages – anti-superstition statements are well-pronounced and there is even a flippant, “educate your girl child” line. I didn't know if I should laugh or cry at this last one. A pro-girl-education slogan when the two women characters, of the 10-12 people in the main cast, were treated rather shabbily. Parineeti Chopra's character is muted out through half the film because, you know, the man oggling at her is so mesmerized by her that he can only see her and not hear her. On the other end, Tabu's character is delegated to voice-over through a lot of her part too. All things aside, the makers didn't even bother to get female singers while they show these two sing in a group song! And of course there is objectification in songs, one with kids too! That these two were given strong characters then seems like poor lip service. Also, the hideous father-daughter hooking-up jokes don't help at all. Of course, there is Shreyas Talpade's lisp and Tusshar Kapoor's aa-ee-ooooo which is shameful but they continue to do it well. Ajay Devgn seems jaded. Arshad Warsi tries very hard to make his presence felt and Kunal Khemu exists. Tabu and Parineeti Chopra do act like they are shouldering the film, which is quite the truth too. I watched Golmaal Again in a single screen theater in one of Maharashtra's northern villages. The men:women ratio was about 99:1 in this almost 500-seater. Usually, people hoot, whistle and dance irrespective of what is going in the film. My usual city-girl gripe is that the sound is atrocious and no one complains about it. It is a good, annual reality check. This is how most of India's audience watches its films. This time around again, the movie started off with hardly audible sound. But, I was pleasantly surprised when there was a shout out from the audience for better sound and the projectionist did his best! People were actually interested in the dialogue. There were huge parts of the film where the audience was watching and listening attentively too! I am not sure though if that is a good thing for the film.

However, it still provides plentiful of laughter thanks to some zany dialogues and the humourous antics of the lead cast. If you are planning to watch Golmaal Again, do make sure that you leave your brains and expectations back at home and then join the laughter!

anilsillay:
          The super success of Judwaa 2 and Golmaal Again will inspire makers for making more cheap comedies. Tough time ahead for Bollywood
        
5blurryface:
          Watched Golmaal Again
Loved the first half but second half was a stretched shit with poor jokes which fails to make u laugh
Overrated film

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Meeta, Happy Diwali!Why do you do this to yourself? You know you're going to hate the upcoming GOLMAAL movie - and that they're casting Parineeti Chopra as a character called "Priyanka" is either a bit of snark over her more-famous, Hollywood-star cousin...or a desperate hope nobody will notice Priyanka Chopra's doing dumb AMERICAN movies now! We'll see it, of course - because me, Bruce, and Craig are all guys, and suckers for silly comedies...and it's Diwali, when big, dumb movies come out.@TimELiebe he he he, here's why:- One of the reasons behind starting wogma was that I wanted to voice my opinion about movies that were "HIT"s but I didn't like them.- I don't mind watching bad movies. Two genres I can't handle are - adult comedy and horror. I still give the latter a shot. I refuse to knowingly watch an adult comedy. I do register my protest though.- It's a job, I try to give it my best. Also, Parineeti is not called Priyanka in the film, where did you get that from?And, how did you like the film?@Meeta, haven't seen it yet, because it hasn't made its way to the US (this is the first year American mainstream media's actually mentioned Diwali as a real holiday!) - going to have to wait for Netflix or Amazon Prime Video to have it on streaming, I guess. ALSO, going to have to wait for an evening when Tammy, Kathy and Cynthia are either all gone, or so desperate they'll let "the guys" watch a really stupid comedy.... :DI understand your point about wanting to voice an opinion on HITs that you dislike, and that's a very good reason. You do it very well, too, even if we disagree more than agree on movies....When I first saw GOLMAAL AGAIN on IMDB, it listed Parineeti Chopra's character as being named "Priyanka", so I assumed it was a joking reference to her cousin. Of course, it's IMDB, and they're wrong as much as they're right.... ::shrug::Personally I have never understood why the Rohit Shetty Golmaal series is such a success with the audiences.  All the way from the first installment till now.  Never enjoyed any of them, and never understood what was so funny about any of them.So, no surprises that this new installment did not tickle my funny bone neither.This time around the band of inane idiots are joined by none other than Tabu, raising some hopes that are quickly dashed, powdered and blown away as soon as the band of 5 enter the scenario.  The movie just goes from one stupid fight / argument / joke / situation to another, without any purpose whatsoever.  It goes on like this till way after the interval.  And the twists, if they could be called that, are so obvious from the moment the film starts.  You have to have just arrived from Pluto to not guess what is cooking.The overt attempts to make a Golmaal meets Singham didn't have any positive impact on me at all.  Yes, there are a one or two genuine LOL moments, and a one or two lump in the throat moments.  But that's too little to make this an enjoyable venture.@Fan - it's a silly comedy series that's got enough physical humor to travel well, and just clever enough with its wordplay that casual viewers of Indian Cinema can feel "with it". Also, Rohit Shetty really loves big goofy dance numbers with vehicles, which end up on YouTube everywhere so people go, "Did You See What Those Crazy Bollywood Movies DO?!?!?"Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
