wogma rating: Watch if you have nothing better to do (?)
The concept of a TV haunting you is truly spooky but it is introduced in such a laidback fashion that you lose interest within the first twenty minutes. And later when the chills do begin it is too little too late.NOT A REVIEW - Just wondering if this one will retain my dislike for horror by making my insides squirm or will it like most other "horror" stories make me laugh unintentionally...Another movie that promises to be different. Not just because the makers claim so but the promos and plot do offer hope. Like a lot of human lives, the movie revolves around TV. And what if, one fine day, the TV takes over control replicating your control over the remote? Spooky. The promos do have the standard - hurling humans, shattering objects, squeaky knives on wood sounds, hooded dude and all that jazz. I can also imagine the Psycho-delic violent violin strumming with the camera walking as if the one holding it is the murderer. It's what will come after and beyond that, which might chill.National award winning director, Vikram K. Kumar hit upon this concept when he came saw this news item - I'm looking forward to seeing Poonam Dhillon on screen, more out of nostalgia than anything else. And maybe this time Neetu Chandra will have a little bit of a meat to her role for us to get a glimpse of her 'talent'. And of course, I've always looked out for work by R. Madhavan from his Banegi Apni Baat days. Ahem! Alas, he's done only 7-8 Hindi films only because of lack of interesting plots -13B is one of the very few Hindi films with him in the lead. And it is being made in Tamil too. Though he seems to have been totally gripped by it, his reaction amused me. And work on it, they supposedly did. Whether it was good enough, we'll know soon enough.Meanwhile, the promotional song 'sexy mama'  got into trouble because of ... yep, you got that right ... the word 'sexy'. The most hilarious bit is that the Tamil promo got a more liberal rating AND they got to keep the word while the Hindi one got an 'A' (Adult) rating and the word had to be changed.What amuses me even better is that now I know that the word 'sexy' was used even before seeing the movie or its promos. Otherwise, I wouldn't even know. And this whole certification bit will only create more buzz around the movie.Anyway, the promo song fulfills all requirements of its nomenclature. Cheesy and irrelevant lyrics, generic music, bikini-clad women, and the protagonist acting completely out of character. Yeah you sort-of can tell even without having seen the movie - compare the song to the trailers. Here you go -The official site interestingly has had over 5 million hits already. That is quite some achievement. True, the site loads really fast compared to other movie sites. And it also has a list of creepy stories. The kind you could potentially use around a campfire on a dark night out with friends. For now, let's see how this story works out in a dark theater.

Guy in front of you banging his head in despair: PRICELESSIt's nice to know you have company for your sentiment towards the movie, right? I've never fancied horror too much. But while watching 13B I was wondering what I dislike more - the squirms when the movie is done well or the annoying 'typical' camerawork and background score which make it unintentionally funny. Some of these standard techniques were just too in the face and obviously annoying. That the movie took a turn for the better in the latter half didn't help much, because by then the enthusiasm of watching the movie had worn off. And since the TV is doing the haunting and making accurate forecasts, you end up seeing everything twice - once in the TV prediction and then in the movie. And sometimes the makers feel obliged to repeat a dialogue or two even after the first repetition. And if not that, then the TV was spoon-feeding us just in case we missed the point that real life was replicating reel life. Not to mention that the appliances taking over life bit is rubbed in till you are just about to begin tearing your hair apart. And why is there such a lack of creativity in trying to horrify us? When was the last time violins rising up to a crescendo didn't bring snickers and eye-rolls? I was craving a normal, straight, non-close-up shot. Some bits are so slow that the director without a doubt knew that the audience would know what is about to happen. Then, why would he do that? And am I the only one bothered when 'the unknown entity' is obsessed with the house address without any rhyme or reason? Madhavan though does a good job of portraying Manohar's anger, his frustration, his vulnerability. The rest of the cast is just about ok. A potentially scary concept was completely messed up. But, just imagine this. All the soap operas on television - what if our real life starts replicating them. Or we believe that our lives are replicating them and they become self-fulfilling prophecies. Now, that's what I call horror!

Manohar (Madhavan) notices that all appliances are behaving strangely and begins to get worried.
Loved the title sequence. 
Stuff going black and white when the dog, Harry's point of view is on display.



How come weird things were happening only to Manohar and not to anyone else in the family?
What was with the old, blind man and his knowing smile?
How come such a tall building had only one life?
What was the purpose of good things happening to the hostages of the TV set?
Why were only those select appliances like lift and mobile phone behaving strangely?
Why were these ghosts obsessed by their home address?
Why did the temple-room walls act up?
Could there be a more in-the-face irrelevantly placed song than 'aasmaan odh kar...'? Or was it an excuse to get Neetu Chandra to shed a few clothes?
The clock counting down to the time the TV program begins as if lives were on stake. Whereas the only thing that Manohar achieves is to know the future a teeny-bit in advance.
How could the women not realize that the TV program showed what happened in their lives only a bit in advance?
Why does Manohar not call his brother directly?
The hint that there might be 13C! Nooooo!! You cannot do this to us.

Why would two friends meet on a cricket ground? And that too to stand in the audience stands?
Why does that household have no maids? Or is it so jinxed that no domestic help likes to stick around? :) 
How come the 30-year old newspaper looks fresh and right out of the printing press?
How come the whole neighborhood has the same umbrella?
The newspapers falling from the top of the shelf. And what was he doing climbing that shelf in the first place.
It's a very nice movie...a new theme for the movie which encouraged to pull the audience.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com. All rights reserved.(Credits: wogma logo by Ain Digytal Inc. wogma audio review signature tune by Shreyas Beltangdy.
