A well-made, well-performed revenge drama that makes you question your definitions of right and wrong, even if the story is unconvincing.For every Johnny Gaddar a director can be forgive at least a couple of Agent Vinods. And Badlapur leans more toward the former than the latter, which is worth looking forward to in itself. And there is always Ek Hasina Thi to keep the balance tipping on the right side. Moreover, whenever newer talent gets a chance to break the mould and try different genres it makes the film even more intriguing. Varun Dhawan is looking good in an intense and even borderline quirky avatar. It is always a pleasure to watch Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Huma Qureshi on screen. Yami Gautam has her own charm too. We'll be seeing Vinay Pathak after a long time too. The one thing that makes me a little skeptical is the revenge theme. It has been done to death and is very difficult to narrate in a way that we haven't seen before. The gore and shock factor seem to have been taken care of though. I love it when films that you look forward to have something on the flip side too.Either way, a thriller a week is always welcome. Exciting times ahead!Music Reviews:

  Does the motivation of a murder justify the murder? Does time elapsed justify forgiving a crime? Is revenge futile? Does it become justified because of the first wrong done? Is a cold-blooded crime less justifiable than one committed in the heat of the moment? Does your justification depend on the justification of the criminal? Is forgiveness less palatable when done by a criminal? You might have your answers to all these questions, but the ambiguity will remain. They are, after all, only “yours”. Your “justifiable” will different from mine. The point is, Badlapur makes you think about where you've drawn the line. Even if not entirely convincing. In that sense, Badlapur pushes the boundaries of a regular Hindi thriller film. We all know its going to go one way or the other – the wronged is going to either take revenge or not.  Badlapur makes you reconsider what and how much your conscience will  allow even if you are not in the judge's seat. But, it involves a leap of faith from your side.We make allowances for films that we begin to like while watching them or the ones we want to like. But very often, the story jerks in a way that you don't quite get. Badlapur did that to me with its character transformations. Sure, they are unpredictable and the unexpected is seldom unexciting. But unpredictable change towards something that was built up for over an hour of screen time doesn't convince you. For me that and the one passage of time  were deal-breakers.  Especially, a short scene just explains it off asking characters and audience to introspect. As a film, a story, Badlapur makes you think of it as a convenient contrivance. As a concept though the film stays with you and it is not only because of the intensity of the violence. If you take what happens as a given you will find yourself mulling over it in circular thoughts. And that is Badlapur's success. You are with the film after the 2+ hours in the theater. The actors stay with you for long after. Nawazuddin Siddiqui makes you laugh in the darkest moments to go with the noir tone of the film. The character and the actor compliment each other perfectly, as can be said about every character that the man plays. So used to his class act are we, that the one thing that I'll remember Badlapur by is Varun Dhawan's performance. It might be a cakewalk for a good actor to play a brooder/sulker. But, Varun Dhawan carries it off while drawin sympathy from the audience. You almost feel like telling him to let go of his anger for his own sake. Huma Qureshi plays aloof and concerned all at once exactly like her character would be in her place. All others in their bit roles from Vinay Pathak to Radhika Apte to Ashwini Kalsekar and Divya Dutta keep the film very rooted. Their expressions and body language make you believe what their character feels. But you might or might not be convinced of what the character feels in the first place. I am slightly ambivalent about the pace of the film too. Not that the slow build-up was an issue, but I can't help but think how the dynamics would have changed had the film lingered a little less and stayed crisp as one has come to accept of a thriller. Starting with a philosophy "The axe forgets. The tree remembers.", Badlapur obviously aims at being a psychological thriller. Unfortunately, it neither is whole-heartedly psychological nor a thriller. Even though it makes you introspect your attitude towards crime and justice.

        ...Badlapur is not your usual run-of-the-mill revenge saga. Nothing in the film is black or white. There are shades of grey even in Varun Dhawan’s Raghu. Conversely, there is something likable about Nawazuddin Siddiqui’s Liak. The film packs its share of twists and turns and culminates in a gritty climax. 
Strongly Recommended. And yes, don’t miss the beginning....

The climax, that one final dialogue, where Huma Qureshi’s character lays it down for Varun’s character changes the entire context of the movie.

Unfortunately it’s not enough to make the experience entirely definitive, invigorating or exciting! Raghavan’s ‘Ek Hasina Thi’ and ‘Johnny Gaddar’ were definitely far greater efforts than this measly entertainer which might just be ranked a bar above his  lackluster spy outing, ‘Agent Vinod!’...

His performance is subtle and controlled through the first half and completely erupts in the second. It’s a brave effort on his part to essay such a challenging role so early in his career. If Varun impresses, the man who stands out in Badlapur is Nawazuddin Siddique. He delivers the performance of a lifetime, as if he were born to play Laik. From his appearance, to his accent to his mannerisms, he entertains you in every frame. It’s the battle between Varun and Nawaz that makes up for the slow pacing of the film. Badlapur works more for its performances than its unparalleled story. Yami Gautam and Huma Qureshi don’t get enough screen-time to showcase their talent, but they do well.

In conclusion, Badlapur might not be in the Ek Hasina Thi and Johnny Gaddar league, but it is a happy sign that Sriram Raghavan has left Agent Vinod behind....

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Looks okay except for its name (too cheesy and a poor attempt at sounding massy). Hopefully Sriram is in Johnny Gaddar mode and not the Agent Vinod mode. Good word of mouth should see it through to 70 cr. An acid test for Varun Dhawan though!Rave reviews all over the net. Waiting to read what meetu has to say :).@moviebhakt there you go :DSridhar Raghvan last flick was a fiasco , it was expected to be an edge of thriller movie like his earlier one "Johnny Gaddar". After reading this review particularly if Meetu's verdict is positive , i am convinced i won't be disappointed again. :DWell, Guddu it is not all positive :D@Guddu: The rating might seem positive with catch on dvd for sure. But the written review has lots of hesitation and regret. So not that positive a review. And the little bit of positiveness is probably due to the aandhon mein kaana raja phenomenon.BADLAPUR - Its a new entry in Neo Noir genre.But its not a typical revenge drama in which we havea perfect hero without any sins inside him , neither the villain is atotal sinful person. Rather the characters are of Grey nature and haveboth goods and bads inside them.  Normally Bollywood movies show that there is a villain , whokills any person from Hero's family and our Hero take his revenge , itsfor his inner peace as well as for justice to some extent. But the realquestion is that , is revenge is a right solution to compensate themurder of your loved ones. Is killing back the murderer will give youpeace . Theclimax which is too much unconventional  may not be liked by many. [comment partially deleted because it gives the movie away]The movie lacks the shocking element , because of that somescenes feet flat as our hero doesn't seems like he has a particularplan . Also the revenge drama onlystarts in the 2nd half so the movie actually doesn'tmove much in the first half. Varun Dhawan has got a lot of complaintsthat he cant do different roles other that comic character as he isperfect for comedy. This will prove all those persons wrong (i am alsoone of them). Its not like he has nail it totally but for an actor justthree film old (all the three being too light on nature) he hasdone a pretty good job. And he will only get better from here. Now heis a threat for his generation of actors. To write about Siddique isbeing difficult now a days. He shows so much perfection to hischaracter that leave no words to describe it.its actually toodifficult for a hero to shine in a film in which Siddique plays avillain. Siddique has stolen the lime light from Salmaan in kick andnow he has stolen all the praise from Varun(Luckily in Kahani & TalaashSiddique doesn't have a too much important role otherwise he shouldhave stolen it from Vidya and Aamir too) . And his next will be withSrk in RAEES , be aware Shahrukh.I somuch wanted this movie to be directed by Anurag Kashyap , he could havemade this better. But its good to know that there exist another director in bollywood who can match with Anurag in the same genre.Not for every type of audience ,couldn't recommend it to every one , so watch it as per your taste.Direction: 3    Story: 3    Lead Actors: 4    Character Artists: 3    Dialogues: 3    Screenplay: 2.5    Music Director: 1    Lyrics: 1.5As per Meetu's tweet - It makes you question the concept of right and wrong. Seems intriguing.Agree with the review overall, but amongst the tremendous acting talent available in the film,unfortunately, Varun Dhawan seemed the weakest link. It was the same story with Ek Hasina Thi which was a reasonably decent film except for Urmila Matondkar who couldn't act to save her life. Wish Raghavan would choose his main protagonists more carefully.@Suman we seem to almost agree! :D@Kapil It is interesting, but...@Samir oh. I like how Dhawan played Raghu. May have to do with the change from earlier films, but in absolute terms too his act worked for me.Will check this out this evening. Encouraging reviews and a good start at the BO. Like Neeraj Pandey, Sriram too is a film maker whose name is bigger & popular than the actors who act in his films. We need a lot more of the Pandey's and Raghvan's in India.Meetu u rarely denounce a movie with a verdict "Catch on DVD for sure" , generally ur reviews conclude as "watch if you have nothing to do better" or "switch channels if its on cable".Since u don't provide star ratings for ur analysis it becomes difficult to interpret whether the review is positive or mixed , as an avid reader of your reviews , I instantenously felt u were pleased  with the film overall . :)Varun vs Nawazuddin : Is it even a contest? Nawazuddin carries an otherwise slow paced and partly boring film on his shoulders and delivers a gem of a performance. This guy just never ceases to amaze. As for Varun, unfortunately as hard as he tries, he can just never be convincing a dark, broody revenge hungry role as this (a trait shared by his SOTY co-star Sid Malhotra). Yami Gautam is pretty, Vinay Pathak is wasted, Radhika Apte proves her stripping credentials well enough. Direction is good but the screenplay is a lackluster and loose imo. A decent watchable film nevertheless, all thanks to Nawaz 3.25/5Varun,Nawaz and Raghavan have combined to give us a kickass film!!!!The first half was taut and although the second half feels a tad bit long but the superb climax more than makes up for it.No matter how much I praise,it won't be enough for Nawaz's performance.Badlapur is the most fun I have had in theatres in a long time.These days im listening of the songs of this movie running on top these days...I am very impressed by Varun Dhawan's Acting..Really Impressed.This is what Komal Nahta, whom i rate as India's best and most honest trade analyst has to say about Varun & Nawazuddin in this film "Varun Dhawan does a very good job. He plays the role of Raghav effectively. But his dialogue delivery does not have the desired impact. Nawazuddin Siddiqui is, hands down, the star of the show. He impresses in every single scene and gets into the skin of the character so very brilliantly that there could veritably have been no other actor better than him in this role. His is an award-winning performance indeed." ~ as always, Mr Nahta is spot on this time too!Was able to catch this on DVD. Superb movie. Everybody acted their bit and Varun was good also !! The song Jeena Jeena was  really picturized well and brought a tear to my eye. Won't speak about Nawaz as everything has been said about him. What a performance....this  surely must win loads of IIFA or Filmfare awards. The climax was  superb and was the main point about this movie..though personally i thought Raghu will now go against the inspector too. Anyway..it was very refreshing to see this  after coming back from  watching BV on screen. Not fair to compare..but seems Sriram knows the limits of noir better than the self-proclaimed god of indie. And Sriram's own version of Turkey (AV - Agent Vinod) was way better than BV. Hope there is no CV coming !!Just caught up on Sriram's Ek Hasina Thi.  As I did not find any page for Ek Hasina Thi, I am writing it here.Excellent stuff - EHT.  Real noir film.  You get sucked into the happenings - which move at a fast pace.Although the ending was more filmy stuff - unfortunately noir life does not have such a silver lining.@Fan I recently watched Ek Hasina Thi again and was impressed again :D@Meetu: agreed.  A good film.  Urmila Matondkar surprised, yet again.  Considering the hamming in her first film as lead actress (Chamatkar) she did make massive progress in the 2nd half of her career so far.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
