Some witty lines and their perfect delivery try to compensate for the complete lack of plot and logic. But, the good news for the makers is their target audience isn't looking for logic or cohesion. It is looking for a good time in the theaters by laughing at the silliness and that's what the Rowdy Rathore delivers for them. Exactly as you'd expect, Rowdy Rathore is a mix of a clever lines delivered in a rowdy style and much melodrama. The action is every bit macho and played out with much gusto. And exactly as you'd expect, Rowdy Rathore hasn't an iota of logic to its paper-thin story. So, yes for the fan of masala and Akshay Kumar, it's a package worth every bit of the ticket money. For others like us, it's exactly as you'd expect - a few laughs at the silliness of it all.Amidst the silliness though, you are introduced to Shiva (Akshay Kumar), a petty crook, who doesn't mind letting the world know he is a thief, and hates children; and has no qualms when he thugs his friend. In fact, you are given an example of each to establish his character. And just when you begin to admire the consistency of his character even though he's the 'supposed' hero of the film, you are asked to lose hope of any major character development. For seemingly no rhyme or reason, he chooses to tolerate a child who he's annoyed with rather than have his way. When the lead character is given such shabby treatment, we didn't really think the female lead would be accorded any respect, did we? Not with a title like Rowdy Rathore. While Shiva's lady love, Priya (Sonakshi Sinha) is thrown in and out of the screenplay, as per convenience, Sonakshi herself does little with what her role offers. She lacks grace in the dance and is equally rowdy. However, in this age of Kareena's and Katrinas, her rubenesque proportions are a welcome change. It's a shame then that it looked like they chose to go for a 'waist double' for close-ups of her supposedly slippery waist. That or she breathed out really hard for those close-ups. There is little damage control she could've done in the couple of scenes she is handed down towards the end.Then you have a few villains who thrive on humiliating people - men, women and children alike; weaker the better. Living in the heart of the country, no law applies to them.Amongst many such clichés is rowdiness  that seeps through the comedy, action, romance and sundry predictable emotional moments. And the film starts with melodrama, which doesn't dip right to the end. This consistency makes Rowdy Rathore an 'entertainer' that requires no laws of story-telling, or good film-making. The attempt at symbolism is hilarious because it is expressed too literally - from raping the police to the references to the mythology of Ram and Krishna, everything is spoon-fed.What I did like though is that amid a lot of the violence, child artists were largely protected from being a part of it or even witness to it. But that there are a couple of scenes where children to witness utmost brutality makes me wonder if it was by design or coincidence. But that's a small reward (if it can even be called that!) for seeing Akshay Kumar as Shiva dressed in pinks, reds, oranges, yellows, lime greens and purples. You can only imagine how loud the background score is to go with these bright colors. But I do get it that that's the central theme - loudness. While Rowdy Rathore is certainly not a film I'd recommend, but it has a carved audience of people who aren't going to wait for any such recommendation.

          30sec of Kareena Kapoor was the only good part about rowdy rathore #movie @KareenaNo1

          Sanjay Leela Bhansali: Rowdy Rathod. You gotta be kidding me. WORST MOVIE EVER. U need help!! @akshaykumar what were you thinking??
        
KamathGurudutt:
          Rowdy Rathore pathetic, geesa-peeta, gory, headache-inducing movie.  Every 5 minutes I was asking -- ye ghatiya film kab khatam hogi? Avoid.
        
gooner_rachit:
          Rowdy Rathore : a waste of time
        
Brahmonaut:
          Rowdy Rathore is so bad, that the next episode of Satyamev Jayate will address the issue of falling standards of bollywood. #SMJ

ashpathak1989:
          Rowdy Rathore is a crap.......
It doesn't deserves more than one star in ratings..
        
anshul_bhat:
          Was not a good idea to watch Rowdy Rathore with kids. Nightmares :-(
        
ahsandaredia:
          I am now convinced that Akshaye Kumar is the worst actor alive. Rowdy Rathore ne dhimaag ka halwa bana diya hai. 2/10
        
AartiCKansal:

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Shiva is a small-time pick-pocket thriving in Mumbai. Vikram Rathore is a valiant, honest officer in a little village in the heartland and is presumed dead by the villains of the village. Shiva looks like Vikram. Shiva is a small-time pick-pocket thriving in Mumbai. Vikram Rathore is a valiant, honest officer in a little village in the heartland and is presumed dead by the villains of the village.

The SLB films video logo is beautiful.
'Chinta ta ta' theme step introduced in the titles of the film looks grand.
The statutory warning against smoking is direct and cool. Not that I agree with whether or not it belongs in a film at all, but that if it has to be there,  might well go about it, in a cool way.
It was rather cartoonish but that the thieves could see jewelry walking around and not people was a nice way of putting their minds across. 
The 'stop-rewind-play'. Every time it is used, brought a smile.
Mockery of men's deodorant adverts. 
Use of the 'chinta ta ta' step to do CPR on an unconscious person.
The way Shiva flicks mobile phones.
Akshay Kumar's dance in white in the last song. It was simply amazing, especially for a man his age. 

Self-referencing joke by Akshay Kumar was too predictable. Also, the way it came about was as if he was exposing his insecurity.
Kareena Kapoor's special appearance.
The loud chachi at the wedding.
Well, there is no attempt at all at thinking about continuity or logical jumps, let alone maintaining them. So, no point in listing them here. 
@Prashant hopefully there will be a slow and steady change. At least some of the non-standard films are getting a break from the larger audience. @nkit i guess i should have said *relatively* clever?@Pradeep :D I have forgotten the potential Akshay Kumar had as an actor. Or maybe I have given up.@Sachin You can check http://wogma.com/category/hindi-movies/basic/ instead of the main page. This will give you only films that are in Hindi. Hope that works. Thank you.@TimEliebe oh well, waht can I say? Let me know what you and your wife think?@Sunny :)@Anuj good for you!! @TimELiebe and Aankhen too! http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0306434/@Anuj arre, just because Akshay Kumar acted well in Aankhen and Khakee how does it take away anything from the other actors of the film?@Anuj No-no! no sarcasm. and yes, I don't like him in those typical comedy roles. Gets to me after a while. Which is why his act in Khakhee and Aankhen was a refreshing surprise.@TimELiebe now let's hope at least some of you enjoy it.FYI, we saw AANKHEN a few weeks back, and yes you were right, Meetu - it was an excellent showcase for Akshay Kumar's serious side. The plot was a bit hard to swallow in spots but undeniably suspenseful, and they tied up some seemingly dropped plot threads in a way that had us all laughing with delight! I hadn't expected Amitabh Bachchan to be such a flat-out villain, Sushmita Sen is my new crush and has impressive acting chops every time we've seen her, it was good to see Arjun Rampal play a hero role for a change (we mostly know him as "Mike" from OM SHANTI OM and Ra-One's Terminator form), and Paresh Rawal brought some surprising poignancy to a stock comic relief character. Thank you very much for the recommendation! It was worth the purchase - since Netflix still doesn't have it...Oh, excellent @TimELiebe! I'm so glad you guys enjoyed it :D@Anuj: Do I need to watch DABANGG? I've seen it crop up as what I guess is a kind of "hip cult film" in other Bollywood movies (kind of the way Al Pacino's SCARFACE crops up in recent Hollywood movies)....@Meetu: Apparently the only way to legally watch ROWDY RATHORE in the US is via Netflix Streaming - which uses some kind of removable subtitles option that is hard to turn on if you're not watching the movie on a computer! We tried watching the first few minutes last night after giving up on WE ARE FAMILY a half-hour in (more in my comment on it), and while it looked like a lot of dumb fun, I was the only person watching who was willing to try and parse the story out without benefit of subtitles....@TimELiebe I'd say wait for the DVD with subtitles to be out.@Meetu, we finally watched ROWDY RATHORE - and yeah, I guess we were the target audience for this movie, because we all loved it! Yes, it was ridiculous and over-the-top, and that thing with water as a brain hemorrhage cure was treated more like a super-power than anything medically possible  - but everybody, even Tammy who started out grousing about some of the logic and plot holes, ended up clapping up clapping our hands in glee and chanting, "Row-Dy! Row-Ry! Row-Dy Rathore!"It's the kind of dumb fun entertainer that we sometimes really enjoy seeing - the songs were good, the dances were fun (we liked Sonakshi Sinha's dancing better than you did, apparently - and thought she was fun as a nice girl turned badass!), the kid was just the right blend of adorable and persistent to melt the hero's hard heart, the villains were irredeemable slime bags fit only for extermination, and Akshay Kumar was giving it his all in the light-adventre hero department. We bought it on DVD (finally!) after fussing with Netflix Streaming several times without success - and I'm glad we did, because I think this is a crowd-pleaser we'll come back to.In fact, I'm going to share this movie with my friends on The Gentlmen's Guide to Midnight Cinema - I think it's right up their alley....@TimELiebe oh dear lord...to each his own, to each his own.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
