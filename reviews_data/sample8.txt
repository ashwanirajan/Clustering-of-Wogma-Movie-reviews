A decent thriller with a valid crux that could've engaged much better if it weren’t so slow. You’re left with too much time figure out the loopholes in the twists and turns.  Brilliant teacher vs. well-trained student, patriotism, angst against the corrupt and frustration with the system – all come together for an intriguing trailer. However, whether or not it will translate to a thriller right till the end depends on way too many variables that have a strong tendency to go wrong.For instance, that this thriller has songs is a put off in itself. I hope they are well placed at least. So, while the thriller genre is welcome after a few weeks of social cause films, one has to step into the theater with a fair amount of controlled expectations, if any at all.Aiyaary releases on 16 February, 2018.Music Reviews:
Bombay Times - "the album does warrant a hear. " 
Bollywood Hungama – "2.5/5" 
Movie Talkies - "there isn't anything in there that you turn away from" 
Music Aloud - "2/5"

  It is to the film’s credit that it manages to keep you hooked despite having one of the lamest starts a thriller could have, and being excruciatingly and unnecessarily slow a little too frequently. The broader story and its core message are interesting.
But for the details, logical gaps and and the speed at which they unfold take away from the film. The audience is asked to make assumptions and accept what’s shown. This would have been fine because thrillers invariably have loopholes. However, decent thrillers jump through the logic at double speed giving you no time to think, unless you ponder over it later. Aiyaary chooses completely avoidable slow motion and long pauses for characters to stare into the distance. The story’s outer shell is about an army officer from a secret team who has gone rogue. At the core though, Aiyaari questions the system. This is hardly the first time that a thriller has asked these questions. But, I thought the manner in which Aiyyari frames this question is insightful and thought-provoking. So what if it is not going to last beyond the 2.5+ hours of the run-time. Even the other details in the writing seem forced. For instance, the constant use of social media platforms in the dialogue, sounded like the writers wanted to come across as tech-savvy. And when a hacker mumbles aloud the steps she’s taking to show that she is an ace programmer, it just sounds ridiculous. I guess we should just be happy that women have actual jobs here. So what, if they leave it all at the drop of a hat, when the script so demands. The script has many such details that sound rather random and there are other spots where details are glaringly missing. What is left then is the overall story arch and that is a good hook. Despite the tardy pace, despite the slack in logic, despite the random details, the larger story is still engaging. While I enjoyed it, I couldn’t help but think how much better it could’ve been if it were 40 minutes shorter. Other than that, the actors all do the drill. The script doesn’t require anything extraordinary from anyone other than Naseeruddin Shah. And for all you know, it could just have been the actor who added that edge to his character. Siddharth Malhotra’s smile gets annoying in its attempt at being cryptic. Manoj Bajpai of course has essayed so many complex characters that this had to be a cakewalk for him. Such is the actor’s repertoire that his earnestness here seems only cute. And then you have the background music that is effective only a couple of times. Otherwise, through the film it has no intention of staying in the background and is in fact, trying too hard to get your attention.Here’s a parting thought. I remember A Wednesday as a crisp, quick film. I wondered if Neeraj Pandey’s films have started getting longer. So, I looked them up  and here is how it goes:Of course, the last one is an exception, but could it be that all these films could have been much better if they were cut short?

        ...Good things were waiting to happen to the political thriller in Hindi cinema. It takes a vast amount of integrity and guts to bring to the screen a drama that dismantles the image of 'Saare Jahan se achcha..' to focus on the corruption within. Designed to poke needles into our collective national conscience, Aiyaary is a film that must be seen by every Indian.

        ...Overall, this movie fails to impress or entertain. It picks a pertinent topic of corruption in the army and then proceeds to make it as boring as possible. Maybe, it has to be watched again to see the subtle ways in which it shows despair with the system but unfortunately I don’t have the patience for that. Aiyaary doesn’t shape shift or create interesting characters for itself. It remains one shapeless boring watch.

Full marks to him as well for giving his hundred percent. He's clearly the student of the year in this film. Rakul Preet and Pooja Chopra have nothing much to do in this macho masala and go through the paces.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.A Neeraj Pandey film is always awaited with lots of expectations.  His track record is so fantastic, and he has not disappointed so far.  Aiyaari continues his legacy of hard hitting the viewers with the common man's voice and force.  In the 1970s Amitabh Bachchan had set up the perfect common man's messiah with the angry young man fighting the unjust society and the unjust system.  In the 2000s it is Neeraj Pandey who has reclaimed this role of expressing common man's anger and wishes.  He continues this trend in Aiyaari.A politico-military thriller which might not be the best of stories on celluloid but it is sufficiently right to work during its length.  Armed forces, at the end of the day, is an organisation like any other organisation or corporate.  And together with that comes its fair share of politics, greed, corruption, valour, team play, betrayals, agendas.  Yes, a pendulum from vices to virtues to vices.  And Neeraj Pandey mixes the story with real life events like major arms deals of questionable repute, Uri terrorist attack, scam in the name of Kargil widows.The film is an enjoyable watch.  Neeraj Pandey puts together his now trusted, talented ensemble of cast that we have come to associate with Friday filmworks (sans Akshay Kumar).  And he delivers punches that only he can.  Imagine punching the Lutyens media who is shamelessly selling the country in the name of journalism!  And getting away with an applause despite naming and shaming the Lutyens media.  He is the perfect balance that Indian cinema needs from the left leaning country bashing intellectuals like Kashyap, Bharadwaj and of late Raju Hirani.  Neeraj Pandey has the balls and credibility to call a spade a spade in the most brazen manner, and he gets away with it laughing all the way.Performance wise it is a feast with Manoj Bajpai and then in small cameos Anupam Kher and Naseeruddin Shah thrown in.  A new and worthy addition is Adil Hussain.Nice watch.  Do catch it.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
