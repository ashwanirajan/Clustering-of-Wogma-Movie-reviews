Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2 is exactly what you expect. Stereotyping men as poor puppies and women as well...the female kind with a scattered few laughs.The boys are at it again. They want their women but they want to complain about their complaints.  And that I guess, is the summary of many a relationship. Which is all fine and good, everyone needs to vent after all. Some people go ahead and make a movie out of it. Which is alright too. But same vents from even the best of your friends gets repetitive and boring. Good thing about this is though, you can say that it is getting boring out loud. The Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2 trailer promises you exactly that – more of the same. The silver lining is that more of the same makes you expect a few good laughs and that awesome monologue.

  I feel bad. Bad for director-writer Luv Ranjan that he has only met women who take advantage of the man of their life; who are manipulative and completely disregard the man's feelings in the name of love. I feel bad for the male leads in the film who are not only characters, they are symbolic of a larger population. I feel bad for the whole community who they represent. I feel bad for anyone who can relate to these men. It is sad that they haven't encountered any mature women who care and love. It is sad that a supposedly comedy film made me sad and feel bad. Okay, I had a few laughs. But, the larger picture is a bit to grim for a person who believes the world is full of healthy relationships.Oh well. By the way, who are these men who are so confident when wooing a girl that they succeed in getting her attention and more in one go. But these same men become mindless, spineless and do the lady's bidding like a domesticated pet? How? Why? Later, when they grow theis spine back they ask why too. And the answer is they want to marry their hand! (given away in the trailer itself!) No comments. Moving away from bewilderment over attitude towards relationships and coming to the movie itself. It has snappy, witty dialogue and I laughed out loud at some of them too. But, then from work, parent and girlfriend related jokes they became only girl-bashing jokes – which was also fine for a bit. It then became repetitive and predictable. The performances are believable. That is all that can be said really, given the characters were what they were. There is of course, the much expected and I guess, looked forward to monologue by Kartik Aaryan. But that too had a stale feel about it. Pyar Ka Punchnama 2 then is more or less what you expect, more of the same with a slightly better hand at direction. Storywise though if you enjoyed the first installment, you would like this one too. If you were disappointed /upset with that one, it will carry forward to this one. It is not just the fact that it is misogynist for I would have a problem with a man-hating movie too. There is no further insight or deeper look at the relationships. It is not really a part 2, in that sense, it is a remake.

        ...PKP2 is definitely worth a watch. The misogyny is present, but it stays in the under current. The story is just fantastic. The film is not just relevant to our times, it is a straight laced portrayal of our lives. The frivolity of modern relationships and the ease with which people deceive themselves are all presented with the right dash of humour. This one is definitely an upgrade on its original. And a very good film for youngsters.

It's more entertaining than 'Pyaar Ka Punchnama' and is a total "paisa vasool" type of film. The older generation or the family audience might not connect with the theme of this movie as 'Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2' is a young film made, for young people by the young people.

        ...Having said that, though PYAAR KA PUNCHNAMA 2 surely deserves a good rating for its entertainment factor well taken care of, it still remains ‘a guilty kind of enjoyment’ derived from a one dimensional project sidelining its female characters. Perhaps in the third part we will get to see an equal fight of the sexes scaling much better heights. Till then the boys are definitely going to have a great time in the theater supporting Chauka and more.

Let’s reserve our cries of protest for more worthwhile occasions.

This film is designed to please a niche audience no doubt. And word of mouth could do the rest.

And despite Luv Ranjan’s taking up cudgels on behalf of the ‘bechara’ boys, they come across as brainless idiots and losers!  Maybe PKP3 should be from the point of view of girls stuck with whiny mamma’s boys.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.movie is one time watch ! it do gets little irritated. also little away from the reality.I agree to you Meeta, I'm not being a feminist. But this would be my personal review on the movie The Bollywood movie #pyaarkapunchnama is doing nothing bt influencing boys to just enjoy their lives and have their own space in a relationship... Which leads to a break up. And what does "space in a relationship" means, if relationship is good, transparency must be there. Also this movie influence them to not care too much about girlfriends but themselves. The movies shows girls are making everything about themselves. But at the end they gave message. Guys must also be given space.The characters gogo, Siddhart and tarun. They say these 3 guys were happy before the girls show up in their lives!! Really...!! As if dey didn't enjoy at all with the girls. They had all the pleasures and happiness with the girls. Before the girls show their true colors. But in real life Not all girls are like that. Infact the girls who actually loves a guy, supports him, does anything and everything for her boyfriend's happiness, stands by him in every stage of his life, this movie is creating a big problem for them. The girl who does not deserves to be treated in a way she should be. It's because of this movie. This movie won't be able to persuade  the guys who loves a girl truly and madly. This guy would take this movie as just some Bollywood movie not "a fact" because this guy knows what is love and how to love, he knows what he has to do in his life that a Bollywood won't change is Thinking or feelings. I highly criticize this movie for making it worse for the relationships that are not actually meant to be hurted!! They say this movie is targeted on the boys who faces issues in their relationship. Not every boy faces these issues. But because of this movie most guys started thinking that way. The main message of this movie was "the only woman who understands and know a guy is their mother" not completely true. Yes mothers are loving and understanding at every point but she is not the only one... The girlfriend who loves, understands and supports also exists. And the worst is they say the movie is "Relatable". I don't completely agree. Yes it is relatable. But not for everyone. The guy who has a girlfriend who is not at all like those 3 girls, do not relate their problems with the movie. But some guys did, even if they had a good girlfriend, they did relate the movie to their own relationship, was this the motive of the movie???Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
