
wogma rating: Watch if you have nothing better to do (?)
An action romance which is less action, more romance. A little less buffoonery, a little more story. A little less Salman than we expect, a little more Katrina than we expect. Ek Tha Tiger ends up being a regular love story with a national angle and will in all likelihood be underwhelming for the fans.Here comes the mandatory, annual, Salman Khan, Eid release. The one which Salmaniacs can swoon over and instantly convert into a commercial success. Content doesn't matter. Oh, I am sorry, Salman Khan is the content, none else is needed. What do story-lovers like me do? We place our hope in director, Kabir Khan who gave us a memorable, Kabul Express.But all hope wanes as you take a look at the numerous songs, the standard music, and the oh-so typical 'choreography'. You can see it is going to be all about Salman Khan, all over again and a little about Katrina Kaif. With some mumbo-jumbo thrown in about their love and their love for the country. And yes, that it will be Yash-Raj-ified – which actually can take it in either direction, but again very little hope of even Yash Raj meddling with the Salman Khan brand name. I have come very close to accepting that this is how the state of Salman films are going to be, no matter who the writer or director. Irrespective of any of the other people involved, Salman films are for him and his followers. There is nothing more to it. We should just remain grateful that they at least bothered people to do these other jobs instead of Salman doing it all. Enjoy!Music Reviews:

  I love it when a film shows most of what is covered in the promos in the first few minutes of the film. That means they haven’t given away too much and I have a lot of new stuff to look forward to. But, of course, I shouldn’t have begun to hope because the twists of Ek Tha Tiger are clear from a mile away. The rest of the story is just another love story, this once, masked under the guise of feuding nations, instead of feuding families. The ‘message’ being of international peace. Thankfully, the message isn’t drilled down in preachy dialogue. Yet, the dialogue isn’t what one is used to in a Salman film - oozing of style and filminess. Not that that makes the dialogue subtle or likeable. It is just plain lines trying their best to make an impact. Unsuccessfully.This failure has nothing to do with Salman Khan’s usual lack of emotion in dialogue. Nor does it have anything to do with Katrina’s reversion to lifeless dialogue delivery (which is sad to watch.) The writing just doesn’t carry that kind of weight or charm. Every time, you think there might be a decent ‘moment’ coming up, you are let down by something very ordinary. The heart vs. brain dilemma or even the interesting crossroads that India and Pakistan’s intelligence agencies find themselves in is a very thin thread to hook your interest on. But hey, what do you need any of that for when you have two of the best-looking people in the industry filling every frame of the screen. Interestingly, Ek Tha Tiger, unlike most Salman films or even action films, gives the lead lady a lot to play with and a lot more screen time. A welcome change, however wasted it might have been rendered by Katrina Kaif’s emotionless, heavily made up, facial muscles - almost as if she was directed to match Salman’s attempt at acting.The songs too have very little Salman about them. They look and sound like any other regular masala flick. Except for ‘mashaallah’ which you have to wait for until the end credits. The question then remains – should they have attempted to have a coherent story when they didn’t intend to make anything substantial, impactful or entertaining about it? Or should they have simply stuck to what Salman Khan fans enjoy best - mindless action. The action too is more or less lackluster, except for the chase sequence in the climax. Seeing a woman in a Hindi film do cat-like moves is entertaining, alright. But, of course, they had to go ahead and spoil it by some awful use of what looks like green screen and shoddy post-production work. Ek Tha Tiger is an underwhelming experience for a neutral party like me. But going by the fact that I heard almost all dialogue and none of it died down with whistles and cheers tells me that would be a fan’s take too.Oh yes, ladies, you do get a glimpse of a shirtless Salman Khan. Fine, gents too.

          Ek Tha Tiger is big entertainment all the way. Salman's charisma works full on. Music though is weak except Sajid Wajid's Mashallah.

          Ek Tha Tiger totally rocked. A bit far fetched but Salman was suitably restrained and Katrina was good too. An eminently watchable film.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.So what's Salman Khan supposed to be in this movie? Some kind of supercop/superspy? I've seen the promo for the music video where Katrina Kaif (who is stunning, though I question her taste in men!) is drumming wearing a kilt and a loosened necktie while Salman Khan stalks around her and pretends it's dancing.Everybody in our (admittedly Caucasian and American) Bollywood film group can't stand him, and think he comes off as abusive to women - who are his fans, anyway?Sadly, the worth of the film does not even matter. That it will be a major hit, we all know. On the other hand, films like Udaan are declared a flop at the Box Office.And "Thumbs Up"? I have clearly stated that I am "Not interested in watching" this film. Do take care of this error."Seeing a woman in a Hindi film do cat-like moves is entertaining, alright" - That was one of the major 'plus' sequences for me :P@Meetu : Tell me dear lady,being a neutral(i mean a non Salman fanatic),should i watch it at a theatre?Or should i rather wait for the DVD?meetu: I think movie's second half is watchable.The movie was pretty good. No real story, but it kept you engrossed. They could have done with shorter songs, especially the Cuba one. The ending was a little tame for the kind of action we saw throughout the movie. But loved the movie overall anyway.Here is how Salamaniacs should perceive  if they might get disappointed after  watching  d movie , the film title refers to a major concern about Tigers being getting extinct from Indian jungles , the movie was released on 15 august Independence day just to support dis cause Ek Tha Tiger .Good review.. may be I will still go ahead and watch it for Salman and KatrinaWith Salman Khan having on the screen, it was without any doubt that the film is a super entertainment dosage, and with so much of expectations, thankfully it served its purpose and fulfilled the hopes and beliefs of the 'Aam Janta - The Mango People'. It’s a treat for Salman Khan’s fans and a strongly recommended for all the moviegoers. On the whole, Ek Tha Tiger is a sure-shot@TimLiebe The rest of the world, dear sir, the rest of the world.@Rahul sorry about the glitch. Will try to get it fixed asap.@Harsh :)@Anuj wait for the DVD for sure.@Jake true - second half has a little more action than the first one.@Lil cool!@guddu ha ha ha ha@Farida thank you! :DThat movie is awesome & loving to see salman katrina together,Now its all proven that salman is full masala himself.Hated it...I was not supposed to watch anyways, but got confused by some very favorable reviews...Another romantic film! I am still waiting for a real espionage thriller from Bollywood...  & enough of this Indo-Pak love stories... yes I got the point, Bollywood means well but there are other things you can talk about...Saw some people praising Katrina's stunts... I'm sure it was some stuntwoman who will never be known...It is one of the worst movie of salman in recent times after Bodyguard.@Meetu - argh! None of us get Salman Khan's appeal - and we'd like to see Katrina Kaif in more movies he's <b><i>not</i></b> in.  We all enjoyed MERE BROTHER KI DULHAM, even while knowing the story's A Mile Wide and An Inch Deep - and we thought ZINDAGI NA MILEGI DOBARA was one of the more all-around satisfying <i>masala</i> we've seen recently.@Jitaditya i'm sure it was a stuntwoman, but still a woman character getting those stunts looked cooler than usual ;)@Salim :) yes sir!@TimELiebe Agree! :DI am surprised by the review. As someone who isnt a fan of bollywood films because they all lack imagination or originality, i found the film engaging and enjoyable. Its not a work of art but the production shows high standards. I dont know why the action scenes are questioned, they are easily some of the best from bpllywood- the chase at the start, the shop and tram sequence in ireland, the couple being chased through the streets and roofs in Cuba, in addition to the final fight sequence, all were excellent. Also pleased the film was only 2 hours 10 mins. Really left you wanting more! Go watch it!Most overrated film, though smart then other Salman films But seriously it didnt really make sense The worst part was the scene where Salman stops a train from clash with his jacket it was so stupid Even the climax wasnt too convincingOverall decentDirection: 2    Story: 2    Lead Actors: 3    Character Artists: 1.5    Dialogues: 1    Screenplay: 1.5    Music Director: 1.5    Lyrics: 1didnt you realise that salman's body double was used in most stunts?@Silvan of course, and Katrina too. :)Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.

Parental Guidance:


Violence: Lots of it, and some of it is brutal too. 
Language: Clean
Nudity & Sexual content: A few skimpily clad women every now and then. And ofcourse, a shirtless Salman Khan for about 1-2 seconds. 
Concept: Love triumphs all. And what are India and Pakistan fighting about, by the way?
General Look and Feel: Bright sprinkled with enough dull moments.
