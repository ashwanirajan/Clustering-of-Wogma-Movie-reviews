It could have been a good, entertaining story for kids, enjoyable by adults equally, but over-dramatization claims another victim.NOT A REVIEW - Just hoping that money spent on movie-making will take its turn and drive the economy somehow...The news section of the official site declares proudly that Rs. 22 crores were spent on the villain alone! This of course, includes the look, the costumes and the props. But, it also includes his castle, the time spent shooting there, etc. Also for some reason this castle in Prague had to be rebuilt in Mumbai. The entire budget is claimed to be around Rs. 90 crores and is insured for Rs. 50 crores. Yet, 25% of the budget being spent on just one character sounds excessive. Besides, the look came across as comical to me. But then again, the director/writer says
Drona is a world where Amar Chitra Katha meets Frank Miller. 
In addition, the movie's wiki page announces,
Drona has been described as a Harry Potter meets Indiana Jones movie, but with an original storyEven if we assume Goldie was referring to Amar Chitra Katha style of animation and not the 500+ titles, it'd mean there's a combination of 3 groups of fictional characters. Hell yeah, it's going to be original...Anyway, it's interesting that a lot of the buzz around the movie also revolves around the lead lady, Priyanka Chopra. Wonder what the Priyanka Chopra PR team has to say about the "we decided to make action movies when we were diaper buddies" pact between Goldie Behl and Abhishek Bachchan? If this means Abhishek is not over-exposed just for the sake of showcasing the Bachchan Jr. and has as much screen presence as the 3-in-1 'script' requires, nothing like it. No?It also promises to show us "never before seen" special effects and some mind-blowing action. Well, the other Rs. 68 crores must have gone somewhere. I'm hoping these 90 crores of someone's wealth has gone into a decent story and a good film. But, I guess we can feel good that at least the money is changing hands and will do its teeny-weeny bit for the global economy - it was shot in Namibia and Czech Republic, remember!The site's media kit asks me if I've been Dronafied yet? I don't know what that means, but I surely don't want to be Drona-anything till I see what it is all about. Meanwhile, I'm hoping that the movie won't drone and make viewers resort to rona (weeping)... (phew! Got those out of my system, so can think of something else for the review!!)

  There's a blunder in the credits. They forgot a title card -Starring: Blue petal, the digital ancestral spiritandDevdutt, the guiding horseWithout them Drona would lack soul and attitude. Not to mention, our superhero wouldn't have a clue, literally! Sarcasm set aside, I really liked the concept behind debutant blue petal - just the overuse annoyed me. As it is, the movie is flat because of its pace. Without them it'd bend downwards at the corners to form a frown.Which would then resemble the "I carry the burden of the world" scowl Jaya Bachchan wears. Perfect casting! Seriously, when did the lady smile last, on or off screen? It hurts when I remember she brought smiles by her mere presence and was my favorite female actor till about 10 years ago. Oh well...Anyway, when you have music and cinematography doing the character development there is only so much the actors can do with the one-line character descriptions. And they do the 'so much'. Priyanka Chopra dazzles in shiny outfits, and oh yeah, fights. Kay Kay Menon actually seems every bit the eccentric villain he's supposed to be. He can boast of having delivered two interesting lines in the movie. Abhishek broods and battles. He delivers the occasional dialogue, one of which was awesome! He actually looks really pitiable when he is going through tough times. But that is over quickly. Soon enough he has the "What the heck is going on here?" look which absolutely reflects the audience's sentiments. And this stays. Through the car chases. Through one inane sub-plot after the other, especially in the second half.Actually, I really liked the way it started. It had that nice story-telling tone. Characters seemed to have caricatured personalities for a reason - they were part of a mythological tale. The parable itself seemed to have an interesting base. The villain seemed eerily weird. The editing was slick with imaginative transitions. I was enjoying despite redundant songs and having written off the dialogues very early on. What can you expect when an egoist, full-of-himself villain says Gustakhi maaf (pardon me)?Yes, I had begun wondering if the wait for a good, kids', action, Hindi movie is over. But, gradually by the end of the first hour, my inner voice wanted to reach out to the makers, demanding an interval. Cut now, or you are going to have nothing to say later. They didn't listen.  And the second half made the pre-interval phase a blur. You know how 'stars' are introduced in a typical masala Hindi movie? - Slow motion, inexplicable melodrama, enhanced with jarring music in background, cameras making movements to make the tall actor looking even more larger-than-life. The entire second half seems like it is introducing one actor or the other! There's a bit of that in the first half but it seems so negligible by the end. The emotional drama takes forever to unfold - Drona and mama, Drona and Sonia, Drona and his father, Drona and his ancestors, Drona and his horse, Drona and his enemy. And get this Drona is not the supercool hero who can taken on the world himself, he needs them at every move. However, he somehow knows how to combat and his heroic skills suddenly peak every time he needs to save his bodyguard (Priyanka Chopra). And this ain't any regular protector, she's the 'royal' bodyguard who needs to be majestically rescued every 10th minute! And at the end of it? There is no satisfactory achievement, just some more mumbo-jumbo about having saved the world.True, there have been quite a few lame superheroes. He gets to be special because well, he's the 'chosen one'. Usually the sidekicks are a set of strong personalities with their interesting idiosyncrasies. But here, who has the time for such stuff when you are location hunting all over the globe and know you are going to spend a lot of time in post production with the digital intermediate guys. Our man just needs to be at the right place, at the right time, with the right amount of background music and camera movements for over a couple of hours.So, are the special effects and action sequences worth a trip to the theater? Well, I'd think not. If you like movies just for those things, you must certainly have seen it all already - if not in a Hindi movie elsewhere. You can think of Drona as the coming of age of a 'special' boy. He supposedly finds love, loses it - twice, finds it again, overcomes his fears, and discovers his 'inner strength'.  He achieves all of this, at most times by just walking a few steps and the rest is taken care of by the graphics department. The struggle 'external' or 'internal' doesn't quite reach a high note. And that doesn't quite work.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.The elixir of life is hidden on earth. And Drona (Abhishek Bachchan) is in charge of protecting it from the current demon Riz (Kay Kay Menon). Sonia (Priyanka Chopra ) is in charge of seeing Drona through his task.The elixir of life is hidden on earth. And Drona (Abhishek Bachchan) is in charge of protecting it from the current demon Riz (Kay Kay Menon). Sonia (Priyanka Chopra ) is in charge of seeing Drona through his task.
The fairty-tale, step-motherly outfits used for Drona's foster mother.
Picturisation of the 'khushi' song. I liked the way Abhishek Bachchan doesn't lose the sad expression in the song when he is out of his fantasy world and in his real world.
Riz's clone. Awesome makeup.
The idea that the villain is so creepy that he can hurt his clone, he has created himself. Unfortunately it stays there and nothing comes of it.
Background music with sounds of vulture/creepy bird squeals when the villain is on screen.
The concept of a sandstorm putting fire out.
The idea of Drona and Sonia starting towards knowing the secret, step by step when they enter 'Raazpur'
Color scheme used to show the town and inhabitants of "Raazpur". Looked like an imaginary world.
the idea of Sonia being hypnotized to do what she was made to do.

Every time I see the Shah Rukh look alike in a movie (playing Drona's foster brother), I feel the makers are taking a dig at Shah Rukh Khan.
The brick sliding scene to show a hole in the wall (taken from Harry Potter) is done very shabbily.
The rotating graphically designed props, the electric waves, the test tubes in Riz's palace. They looked very shoddy.
The weapon Sonia uses in her introductory sequence. What exactly was the purpose? And not that I'm complaining, why does it not show up in the rest of the movie?
What was the entire garage set-up for? A song?
Why did Sonia want to bail out?
The cardboard sets of Raazpur. Why show them breaking down when it is going to be so obvious that they are sets.
The revolving blue petals. They did their thing for 120 seconds too long. The ancestral spirit seemed to be in no hurry!
Shashi, whether or not Kay Kay Menon has found his due, we'll know only after we've seen the movie, right? Interesting question about the hit ratio, will see if I can set something up in the changes we are planning.That is strange, Rohan!Thanks Pankaj! Hmmm...piracy :(Drona should get junk movie of the year award , i went for sleep during the movie.one more priyanka plzzzz kabhi kuwait aao na plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzlove u 4 everrrrrCopyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.

Parental Guidance:


Violence: As much or as less as you would have in a typical mythological story.
Nudity, sexual content: None except for the song with skimpily-clad girls playing while the end credits roll.
Concept: Good vs. evil. Age old, time-tested formula
General Look and Feel: This one seems to have been made with kids in mind. But the second half is too slow because of the emotional drama.
