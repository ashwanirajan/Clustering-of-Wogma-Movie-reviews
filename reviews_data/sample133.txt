Inconsistently insightful and sensible. The uneven story and sermons take away from what the film wants to say.The only thing not annoying about the Ki & Ka trailer is that the film is directed by R. Balki. That is the only ray of hope. Usually, I don't comment on the gender stereotyping in films because you know, what's there to say about something that is so common. Ki & Ka's trailer however forces you to lose your cool. We, women folk, were doing fine without you having a man behave the way you think a woman behaves. Kareena Kapoor and Arjun Kapoor offer little to look forward to. That's not to say one can't expect them to do their job well, just that it is unlikely to be anything out of the ordinary. I actually don't mind a romcom a week, but this one looks like it is out to get to you than to break norms.Music Reviews:

  If you watch Ki & Ka as a film on gender equality you are very likely to be peeved off. However, if you look at it as a crusade for the “sitting at home” housewives, then it has a certain case to make. It looked like it was aiming for the former. And misses big time. Even so, if even a handful of us (not just men) took the “not just sitting around” housewives point home, it is progress. If a few of us took the “being comfortable in your skin even when you are sitting around” point home, even better. You can see Ki & Ka counter the very points it tries to make. While you could think of the contradictions as society's struggle with accepting a change in its perception, it feels like you are giving the film too much credit. They seem more like slip-ups in the writer's thought process. These inconsistencies are across the board - in the broader strokes Ki & Ka paints and in the way characters behave. Both Ki-a and Ka-bir go completely uncharacteristically berserk at different points in the film. The tantrums and the resolutions are jolting and seem off balance in an otherwise supposedly mature relationship. This is after accounting for the fact that they are humans - they are allowed to go out of character, once in a while. In that sense, insecurity creeping in, even if it is at its immature best, is understandable too. It simmers well before blowing up. It is the proportion that catches you off-guard. An insight at the end of the film sums it up really well.  Only, if only, it hadn't felt like a sermon. Then there is this one other scene that beautifully sums up all that Ki & Ka wants to say. I was in awe through that scene because of what we know from real life about the actors in it. Saying any more, will give the scene away, so I leave it for you to discover even if as a stand-alone clip on YouTube some day. The performances overall are quite in place. I am too warm with nostalgia to comment about Swaroop Sampat's performance. I'll just say this - she has a cool-yet-motherly presence about her. From scene one, where Kareena Kapoor's character does not want to dance to when she goes completely mental (even if it is out of character) she does well. In fact, you quite forget you are watching Kareena Kapoor as you are try to figure Kia out. Arjun Kapoor, as the laid back, 100% comfortable with being laid back Kabir, does well too. These performances are good enough, to leave the inconsistencies for analysis after you have seen the film and, to watch it for what it is for now. Annoyingly enough, you take the trouble of letting go and try to be a spectator to Kia and Kabir's life to suddenly find yourself in an advertisement. What is with all the product placements! Some subtle and some not so subtle. As jarring as they are you try to ignore them the best you can and try to grapple with this comment on the way we are. Confident go-getter Kia becomes insecure almost at the drop of a hat. And cool-cat Kabir is confident even as a man-child. Isn't this how it is? Many, if not most, women have to work hard to be secure and men are raised as confident people? Is this what Ki & Ka was getting at subtly? Was this intentional or coincidental?Even if it was unintentional, the choice to present that insight on being human, on relationships and the one scene that is pretty much unforgettable take Ki & Ka to a likable level. Yet, every time a thick wall was built between the earner and the caretaker, I was reminded of this couple I saw with a  baby recently. Everything was division of labour - I fed the baby in the morning, you do it in the evening; I put the baby to bed three days in a row, now you do it. Is that what relationships are? Two people can't do the same thing together? Both can't earn? Both can't take care of chores? Which is why Ki & Ka comes across more as a pat on the back of housewives. Much needed as that pat is - and I can't over-emphasize that - it doesn't make the film a rom-com and it certainly doesn't make it a balanced take on relationships.

        ...The crisis, you feel, is brought on because every film needs one. Ironically the climactic crisis in the couple’s marriage is precipitated by Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan who make a very agreeable joint appearance. The best dialogue of the film is given to Mrs Bachchan who tells her superstar husband, “If I had continued my career and if you had agreed to look after our home I would have been the one waving to fans outside.”

        ...On the whole, KI & KA is a cleverly crafted feel-good film that packs all the emotions. Though it has strong performances by both Arjun and Kareena, the film is bound to draw extreme reactions from the orthodox audiences who may find the premise difficult to digest. It is an urban progressive film and should appeal more to women and young married couples.

Yet, Ki and Ka is worth a ticket because it tells shows how there is nothing wrong with the man wearing the apron and the women wearing her ambition.

        ...Increasing numbers of Indian women are refusing to throttle their professional ambitions in favour of managing a home, while a minuscule number of Indian men are opting to take on roles traditionally deemed to be a feminine preserve. In this scenario, a romcom on a stay-at-home husband is very pertinent. Large swathes of Ki & Ka are fun, considerable sections of it are unexpectedly broad-minded, path-breaking for Bollywood and insightful. The problem is that we can section it off in this fashion. Ultimately, what fails the film is its mixed messaging and choppy texture.

That doesn’t make it a bad film, but it falls short of the mark it was aiming for.

Haven't you ever ordered a large pizza with the works - extra cheese, extra toppings - and then asked for a whole-wheat base just to allay your guilt? Obviously, the director wanted to try his hand at a typical Bollywood rom-com, but moved forward with a pertinent concept in keeping with his reputation for making topical films. This kind of straddling has been successful in the past, but sadly, is not in this case. So grab a slice only if you're in the mood for mildly entertaining, escapist fare. Otherwise, skip it.

Achilless__:
          Ki & Ka and Kapoor & Sons are too very fine unorthodox drama movies. Which ofcourse unconventional mind won't ever understand.

th_mnmlst:
          Ki & Ka; enjoyable, but don’t forget to turn off your brain.

(To be fair, the second half of that sentence applies to nearly every movie.)
        
sudipto0999:
          Ki & ka is an awareness film.kareena& arjun were super.But something was missing & sometimes boring. Concept was excellent.
@kareena_kapoor
        
sachinchatte:
          Ki & Ka is a laborious watch. Balki tries way too hard to make a point that's already been made. And let the visuals speak,not the dialogues
        
paikaray_naresh:
          Good try team Ki & Ka but performance was far beyond expectations.
Better luck next time #pnaresh
        
kunaljp:
          Ki & Ka is a refreshing one-time watch. Kareena Kapoor fabulous
        
DeepVeerFan:
          Just watched Ki & Ka. Don't get why some people say it's a bad film. I've definitely seen worse. An average film. Not great, not bad either
        
Umang_Daga:
          While Ki&Ka is another disappointment from bollywood, even #KungFuPanda3 manages to steal the show. #damn pretty well.
        
TheMajNS:
          I recommend Ki and Ka. 'Ki & Ka' to all my enemies... https://t.co/yZ6nqMvGMk

SunithaNahar:
          Seriously very very dissapointed with Ki & Ka , expected a little more reality and stuff .Turned out to be another boring unrealistic movie.
        
sumitkrsingh786:
          Don't watch kareena,s movie ki & ka
        
sreekanthdass:
          Ki & Ka simply kaka! Great idea terrible execution and as they say in advertising "very forced, maza nahi aaraha hai"
        
sib_sibby:
          Ki & Ka could've been so great, considering the concept, but it just ended up being a mess. Fun in parts but messy of all sorts in most!

          Ki &Ka is the result when you make a full length feature film based on an idea that's barely enough for a short film.

          Please watch Rocky Handsome ! Before stupid movies like Ki & Ka steals away all their Showtime.
        
arushdixit:
          Ki & Ka is million years away from reality. No FMCG market manager looks like Karina and no IIM B Grad is as dumb as Arjun.#KiAndKa

            Nay! Thumbs Down,
            by Anuj
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Boy meets girl.  Boy falls for girl and vice versa.  Marital life starts off on cloud nine. Slowly reality bites, and fancy honey coated dreams evaporate; marital bliss makes way for domestic tussles.  Two hours go by, director must cut the film, and so maturity prevails and marital life continues to next domestic tussle. Nothing new.  Just by reversing roles and reminding the audience innumerable times that there is no shame if husband does household chores doesn't make it a memorable film.  Take my advice and save your money by not wasting it on this bogus film.And I still prefer the Hindi film wife and husband referring to each other in tum; the use of tu looked so cheap as if they were talking with pimps and whores.  And the chaddi check karvana - how does one explain it to the child accompanying you.The only good thing, with a full capital letters THE, was the opportunity to see chirpy Swaroop Rawal nee Sampat on screen after a long time.  She was a breath of fresh air in an otherwise stale affair.for the first time the review did not make sense. I mean the reviewer did not make sense.Ever heard the concept of house husbands? Ki and Ka is about that. It tells the story of a man willing to stay home, do domestic chores, take care of parents and children etc. So far it seems to be a progressive story of sorts and in a way shows the changing times in our society.Hahaha...yet another bogus review from a reviewer whose been more of an internet troll in recent times. Ki & Ka is a noble concept that has been shattered to pieces courtesy poor screenplay, mediocre dialogues, out of sync songs and some terrible terrible acting by the lead pair. 1.5/5 (Poor)While the fist quarter delivered 3 memorable films in Airlift, Neerja and Kapoor & Sons, the second quarter of 2016 seems to be heading for disaster with Ki-Ka followed by the self obsessed overacting narcissist blowing his own trumpet in FAN followed by a Tiger Shroff film who perhaps is the only actor in the world who needs a body double not to perform stunts, but to act :Pnice movie..the new generation can learn about gender equality...and most importantly that your sex does not limit you to specific works or bind you to be a bread winerhi friendzzzki & ka is nice simple true bond of love story where they showed nice need of hour topic that man wants to become house keeper where as women is career oriented this movie gives nice message to society infact it is i could say started off frm screen N must come to our real life then life will be smooth if girls who wanna works.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
