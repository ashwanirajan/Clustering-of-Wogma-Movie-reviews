Unabashedly silly. Brings a smile or two, even if soulless – that's exactly what you expect though, right?I think the 90s were by far the worst period for Hindi films. In fact, the films that came out in that decade, especially until 1997 might just have been the reason behind starting wogma. I felt more and more films asked me to keep my brain away. This is irrespective of genre – romance or action, and slapstick comedy the most. Judwaa was one of the last 2-3 films I watched before moving out of the country for a bit. I remember watching it with my mom and both of us didn't believe what we had just seen. Today, with Judwaa 2 at the cusp of its release, makes us cringe at the memory more than bring a smile.  There doesn't seem to be the faintest attempt to bring something new to the film. What's more, it brings a shudder to see Tapsee Pannu in the cast. I am not sure if it is a step up or down going from non-standard films/roles to run-of-the-mill mainstream ones. I am hoping against hopes that I will enjoy this one at least better than the original. The songs certainly don't indicate so.Judwaa 2 releases on 29 September, 2017.Music Reviews:
Bollywood Life – "2.5/5"   
    - meeta, a part of the audience
  I'd like to state upfront that I am clearly not a part of this film's target audience because I've never liked slapstick. But over the years, I have realised the core of why I don't like them. I don't find people insulting others, funny. And a lot of Judwaa 2's humor relies on exactly that. Insult the obese, insult the colored,  insult the women, insult those with speech defects – to name a few. I am sure the intention is not to insult but to bring laughs. But that insults bring laughs is a premise I have never understood. Then there are other things like a child is made to objectify women. Now, sure there might be societies where this is encourage or kids pick this up and no one finds anything wrong with it. But, a child artist was made to do it, was taught to do it – isn't that irresponsible of us as adults? That we are expected to find it funny is even worse. Yes, it bothers me even if it is that one child. Because that child got called 'cute' for doing so. Of course, I am not supposed to think too hard. Therefore, there is no effort to have a story at all.  Other than the set-up and the climax, the rest of the film is is just about the misunderstandings due to mistaken identities between the twins – Prem and Raja (Varun Dhawan). These misunderstandings just seem to be on, on repeat mode and get tiring despite all the mustered patience. After all you are being asked to sit patiently and brainlessly through awful Shah Rukh Khan impersonations, disgustingly designed mens' toilet booths, and Varun Dhawan switching between the film's definition of good boy and bad boy. He performs well within the context of the film but the film itself has little respect for any kind of performance. It is one which makes Sachin Khedekar go over-the-top matching Upasna Singh syllable-to-syllable. And you know, they both have to be loud because they aren't together in a single shot, they have to reach the other through the scenes. Tapsee Pannu seems so uncomfortable as she tries to dance and trot around in clothes that she can't carry in front of the camera, that it feels like she is rushing through her dialogue out of nervousness - as if making up for her almost mute character in Pink. Jacqueline Fernandez plays pretty prop again. I can't remember a single film where she has done anything other than that. It is almost as if you can copy-paste her parts from one film into another and no one could tell the difference. Speaking of copy-paste, a few shots in the 'Ganpati' song, especially the chorus seemed like they were shot only once and just repeated to beat. This kind of cheating is like adding salt on the wound for a viewer who isn't enjoying the movie in the first place. For instance, there is little logic when a doctor tells new parents of twins that when one child cries or laughs, the other will have the same physical reaction. The film has this happen conveniently and not through the film (thank goodness for the flawed logic). However, that the parents interpret this as when one falls weak, the other will be strong had me stumped. And it is not even a scene that warrants this statement. But, when did the doctor say that? Didn't he say the opposite? Or maybe this was a comment on how a patient/parent/human being hears what they want to hear and not necessarily what was told to them.Yep, it is time to sign off. I am giving this one more thought than the filmmakers asked of themselves. I am assigning too much credit, when no one is even asking for it.

It exists for the sole purpose of providing mass entertainment. That Varun Dhawan proves to be such a chip off the old block is providential for David Dhawan.

There are constant references to the director's films like Partner, Raja Babu and many more. This film takes logic and throws it right out of the window. Then it serves up a bevy of mindless humour in the most convincing manner. Seeing the entire Judwaa narrative all over again isn't the most novel experience, but the slapstick gags still leave you with a few guffaws. This is popcorn entertainment at its mindless best....

Judwaa 2 surely has the potential to grow big majorly through the word of mouth publicity, whose catalysts will be the college going crowd, for whom, missing a Varun Dhawan film is an unpardonable sin!

The actor manages to nail the one-liners but barely has what it takes to pull off a movie on his own, even while doubling his efforts. While Dhawan seems at home as Raja, he channels a Hrithik Roshan from Koi Mil Gaya as Prem. The dispensable nature of female actors in such films contains the potential of Jacqueline and Taapsee. But of the two, Jacqueline seems more enthusiastic in furnishing a flimsy female lead.

          Can't believe I'm saying this but I actually prefer Salman's silly shit from the first instalment over the monstrosity that is Judwaa 2.

ThatYogi:
          Judwaa 2 is a lame excuse for a movie. Rather watch the original all over again... Pathetic to see Taapsi 'Pink' Pannu wasted in such movies

          Judwaa 2 is pointless comedy and Newton is just the opposite!
        
Page_Subrata:
          Had great regards you #DAVIDDHAWANji. But After Judwa 2, it diminished. Is there no creativity left in Bollywood at the moment? Why remake?

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Haha :D knew what was in store even before i came here...good one, meetu@Bibs yeah, one of those times when I don't mind being predictable. Not that I have a choice either :PI still don't get it why did I watch this film when I had not at all enjoyed the original!!  Similar reflections as with Himmatwala, why remake a horrible film?I can't even be bothered to write anything about this film except that stay away from it if you are looking for good entertainment.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
