In keeping with the Diwali mood, Action Replayy is all about bright colours and loud noises. Expect no more than that (not even a plot) and you'll be entertained...just about enough. The superficiality of depiction of the 70s era grates but the gags carry you through for some part. After that, it's time to walk out of the theatre and never think about it again.There are only so many ways you can say, "boy meets girl" in. But, if there is a fresh angle to it, movie-goers, however irregular, will lap it up. I know that a regular like me got excited when I read that Action Replayy starts with a son tired of his parents' squabbles. But read on and soon enough found out that he has to go back in time to make his parents fall in love, good ol' Bollywood style. #facepalm. Maybe that's how it is, love (without bickering) exists only in movies. 
So at the very least, can we expect a blast from the 70s, plain Mukherjee-Chatterjee style? Yeah, right! As far as I can tell from the promos, the 70s was only about long, wigged hair-styles, bell-bottomed pants, floral shirts, tight chudidaars and rock-n-roll? Yes, I'm being sarcastic, because in the name of being 'different', I'm served the same ol' loudness, only with 'different' excuses. 
Anyway, let's try to enjoy what we have rather than complain about what cannot be. I love Aishwarya Rai's saris, they don't look 70s-ish, that makes them very wearble in real-life 00s. Similarly, the music and choregraphy is not very 70s-like but I completely enjoyed them. Though the first part of the prelude of this one sounds very similar to a song from Dhoom in this one, the play with colors is very pleasing. 

Also, the marwadi in me, can see 'zor ka jhatka...  making it to the chartbuster list of wedding sangeet parties. Which might actually picturise the song better than the one the director has come up with - completely kills the beat and is contrary to the mood of the song. Anyhow, other music reviews are mostly in awe of the music too -
milliblog - "5 enjoyable tracks – what more does one want?" 
apun ka choice - "justifies the title of the film and makes us want to rewind whatever we hear "
Bollywood Hungama - "3.5/5" 
Bolly Spice - "Standout track: Chhan Ke Mohalla, without a doubt." 
music aloud - "8.5/10"
dunkdaft - "Inconsistent"
However, whatever the music is like, it still can't take away from my weariness about the slapstick we might have to endure. And the fact that whether it is the 00s or the 00s pretending to be 70s you cannot take out the Akshay Kumar from the Akshay Kumar. Just a different hairdo doesn't do the do.

Since Akshay Kumar can only promise his extent of acting, can we have some hope from Ms. Rai Bachchan who has THE pair from the 70s around at home to tutor her? It won't be too much to expect a little bit of comic timing for her, would it? If not, then there is little hope in terms of her X-factor, because I see
Neha Dhupia exuding more oomph than Aishwarya Rai wherever you see the former. 
Oh well, a few good laughs is all I ask for. Can we have some of those this Diwali?

  Note from meetu - Diwali on Fridays has been one of my worst dilemmas. wogma vs. family - a couple of the most high-profile films of the year versus the annual extended family get-together?  Invariably, I end up choosing family. After all, there are many Fridays but only one Diwali in a year.
Handing it over to Ideasmith, who's reviewing Action Replayy for me. Thanks a ton! Means much! 
Wish you all a crackling Diwali and a brighter year ahead!
Handing it over to Ideasmith, who's reviewing Action Replayy for me. Thanks a ton! Means much! 
Wish you all a crackling Diwali and a brighter year ahead!If you are a fan of 70s pop culture, if ‘retro’ sounds like home to you, then please don’t watch Action Replayy – you might be tempted to destroy some furniture. If you are a sci-fi buff and still hold out for some promise in Bollywood, I suggest you look elsewhere. But if bright colours, loud noises and easy gags entertain you, Action Replayy just might work for you. Just don’t expect another Om Shanti Om. In some ways, Action Replayy is a fitting Diwali release, considering that the volume is turned up all through the movie. Think blinding pyschedelia in Eastman colour and crescendo-style background scores for the frequent melodrama scenes. The movie starts on the run, with everything speeded up, which you figure might be so that the story can get to the main meaty blast from the past. Once there, the plot loses its pace and runs on spoofy moments vaguely reminiscent of 70s cinema, like exaggerated caricatures and extreme proclamations (“No love marriage!”). The trouble with this spoof is its lack of authenticity. Considering that the subject is an age of rich iconography and abundant pop culture references, Action Replayy is woefully tacky in its depiction. Coverage is very superficial, sticking only to crazy hairstyles and an explosion of polka-dots in every scene. For the first half of the movie, the sheer novelty of time travel, the cinematic flourishes of switching to Eastman colour, the vibrancy of retro-style Bombay keep you engaged. The scene where Bunty (Aditya) first looks around and gets his bearings in 70s’ Bombay carries through predictably but nicely. After the interval, the mixed up references, the lack of a coherent plot and the jerky pace start to grate a bit. There is some saving grace in the chase sequence at the end, true to 70s cinema complete with action, comedy and romance.  Akshay Kumar hams it up as Kishen ‘Kitchen’ Kumar, the loser-turned-stud and it fits well enough in a movie of this type. Aishwarya Rai’s character seems to have gone astray since she starts off as shrewish, morphs into impish, detours into bully tomboy and finally dissolves into maudlin. Om Puri and Kiron Kher look like their having a real blast in their extreme but funny roles. A talented actor like Rajpal Yadav is sadly wasted in the sort of role usually reserved for the Johnny Levers and Jaspal Bhattis of current day Bollywood. Randhir Kapoor and Neha Dhupia each make blink-and-you-miss-it appearances. The real surprise in this movie is newcomer Aditya Roy Kapur who navigates the jerky plot with ease, holding his own superbly against the more senior actors (everybody else). Rannvijay Singh may have presence or he may not but its really hard to tell when he’s hidden behind the scary facial hair, styling and acting (possibly a throwback to the chest-rubbing aura of yesteryear Ranjit). The incomplete visual references aside, the music disappoints too, not because it is bad in itself but because music is a key aspect of Bollywood film-making and would be expected to deliver on the past versus present front. Most of it doesn’t fit the style of the era, in terms of melody, lyrics, instrumentation or even choreography. At times, it even even blunders into 80s-style bling or 60s-age nasal voices. Other than the credits theme in the very beginning, none of the other songs fit their situations, at all.If I sound disappointed, it’s only because I know that so much more could have been done even within the limited dimensions of this movie. Even going with a gag-ridden, cardboard-character spoof, the budgets might have been better used if the research had been a little deeper or the story better thought out. Instead, they seemed to have gone for flashy promos and trailers that cull most of the high points of the movie. Everything else is just bright colours and loud noises. Still, it is Diwali after all, so I suppose there is some timepass to be derived from those.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.There is nothing particularly notable about this movie except for the fact its slightly 70s look and feel. Other than that, it's a regular boy-meets-girl story, lacking even basic plot logic and characterization.There is nothing particularly notable about this movie except for the fact its slightly 70s look and feel. Other than that, it's a regular boy-meets-girl story, lacking even basic plot logic and characterization.Aditya Raj Kapur's acting was smooth and effortless without ever getting into hammy. This is vital considering that he is in almost every scene of the film. He essays the role of sutradhar perfectly by never intruding into the lead actors screen space but holding his own. Kiron Kher and Om Puri are their superb selves in character roles.
The random OTT dialogues add mirth and the scenes designed around these don't lose their charm, despite frequent repetition through the film.Aditya Raj Kapur's acting was smooth and effortless without ever getting into hammy.

The 70s were a well-covered decade of pop culture with numerous icons, an abundance of music, dance and art and stylish kitsch. Even for a spoof, Action Replayy hams it up horribly and sticks to targetting the hairstyles and the worst of the styles of the era. There's no real effort made in the music or choreography to stick to the period. This feels particularly wrong especially since music is an integral part of Bollywood story-telling and the era's musical influences continue to be popular even today.The superficial depiction of the 70s comes across a little too jarringly.

He travels to the past with only a small backpack and no money or references to anyone. But once there, he manages to get around fairly easily, frequently drops references to the future (Kareena and Saif, Obama) that nobody questions. Also, his clothes remain modern-day styles all through the movie.
Kishen (Akshay Kumar) in the past is shown to have ugly gummy buckteeth. Then magically (in 7 days to be precise), his teeth are normal again, a trait that continues into his future self.Bunty (Aditya Raj Kapur)'s trademark cotton-candy hairstyle wavers in parts (shorter, straighter etc) and in those scenes, he's virtually unrecognizable.

I don't see the charm in this movie.Rahul, The concept sounds similar. Let's see... :DI Liked the movie very much..it was a totally new concept and Akshay has displayed his comic skills once again.The new boy is also nice.Humour was there in the movie and you should definitely watch this.It is a must watch movie...don't miss it!Though most of the things are totally imaginary but its a nice movie. And i am a fan of Akshay.If you want to watch this movie online then go to http://videocity.us/2010/11/action-replayy-2010/I thought movie was pretty childish. Believe or not I went to work in the middle of the movie leaving family to get tortured for the rest of the movie.Дисконтная карта позволит Вам положить любую сумму на свой личный счет и при этом получить дополнительный бонус.

Violence: None at all. 
Language: Chaste 70s style, even in the bickering. The worst insult is calling someone a gadha (donkey).
Nudity & Sexual content: One conversation about sex which never mentions any of the 'taboo' words and uses conventional imagery like flowers and baby talk. The actresses costumes include very short miniskirts and plunging necklines.
Concept: A love story in the 70s. 
General Look and Feel: Retro (pyschedelia, polka dots, peace symbols) in Eastman colour.
