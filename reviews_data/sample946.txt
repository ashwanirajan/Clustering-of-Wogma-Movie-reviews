wogma rating: Add to 'must watch' list (?)
An engaging story is told using a number of clever twists. The intelligent outwitting however is let down by some awful performances and a rather slowed-down pace.You are out for dinner with a few friends. One of them is a little upset because of something that happened during the day. He gets irritated by something the waiter does and bursts out in anger at him. The waiter had done something really petty, something wrong but not a big deal. What will you do? Join in with your friend? Defend the waiter because it was not really his mistake, but this means you are going against your friend. This is only a minor version of the dilemmas Right Yaaa Wrong presents. The story moves along interestingly and is thought-provoking. If only, it was a tighter and had better performances, it would be a must watch.

I completely enjoyed how as an audience, I really didn't know whose side I was on. Both seemed right and both seemed wrong. Both evoked my sympathy, I wanted both to win. And all of this together kept me involved, engaged. 
Sure, I wasn't 100% involved 100% of the time. First one to blame there is the choice of slow-pace for a genre that needs to be chop-chop. The other one is the lousy performances. Each one of them is performing perfunctorily. The dialogue delivery is extremely amateurish. Especially the bits in which the police officers are bonding in the beginning. 
True, they are just setting the stage for bits and pieces to be used later. But the functional way in which relationships are put forward make them look manipulated and contrived together. So much so that the likes of Irrfan Khan and Konkona Sen Sharma can't cover-up for the others. 
These are huge minuses. So, the story had to take over that much more burden of making the film work. And it does. I enjoyed the back and forth and for me that was enough to make my trip to the theater worth it beyond this review. I enjoy court-room drama as much as I enjoy intelligent characters out-witting each other. They might not be the smartest turn of events but they had basic thought put in, which is conspicuous by their absence in many films of this day. 
Yeah, I'm surprised too. I actually liked a film titled as lamely as Right Yaaa Wrong (especially the extra aa) starring Sunny Deol. Dancing, fuming, and all. But, this is what even a decent attention to story can do to me.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Warning: this section has some details that could distort your experience while watching the movie. I strongly recommend reading this only after you have seen the movie or if you have decided not to see it.Ajay (Sunny Deol) an honest and brave police officer is paralyzed by a gun shot in one of the encounters. This is only the stage set for the dilemmas that betrayal and definitions of right and wrong can bring.Ajay (Sunny Deol) an honest and brave police officer is paralyzed by a gun shot in one of the encounters.

What ever happened to the chaperon that came in with Ajay when he comes back after a successful visit to the doctor?
The lady in the champagne glass. Awesome!
The aerial shot of Goa at night. Very brief but different from how Goa is covered otherwise.
Use of 'koi haseena agar rooth jaati hai to'. 

Irrfan Khan's salute to a constable. Priceless!
The songs.
The camerawork and editing.
I haven't seen the film yet. So can't comment on the review.But I liked the last two lines of the review "Yeah, I'm surprised ..." :-). Bollywood seems to be having a huge dearth of titles these days. "Right Yaa Wrong", "Mr. White Mr. Black", "Black and White", "Aagey se right" and so on :)typical sameer, boring to the hilt. amitraj sung from heart but voice is pretty ordinary. i won't waste a penny on such stuff.thanks for post.I should tell you this, somewhere around I like Sunny Deol, he was the first action hero I saw in Ghayal. Of course, I know how his movies are nowadays - but hey, he was my childhood hero - give him a break!When I saw Right Yaa Wrong, we were joking that he's gonna say "Tareek pe Tareek' in the courtroom, but hey, the movie was quite good - even if I yet to find out which computer program gives that kind of simulation shown.@Samir such is life! :)I would rip the waiters head off! ;) Just kidding......this movie does look very thought provoking.....I will have to check it out!As Darshak said "Meri Aashao Ki" song was awesome and I very much enjoyed this song a lot.In fact, very little has changed since that fateful day Manny's first hit porterhouse grill in 1988.The film have received mixed reviews from critics. Mayank Shekhar of Hindustan Times and Rajeev Masand of IBN has panned the movie, while Nikhat Khazmi of Times of India and Taran Adarsh of DNA rated it above average.The film received an overall rating of 5/10.As of 28 March 2010, it was declared a disaster at the Box office.I haven't seen this movie yet and planning to watch it. Anywya I haven't seen any movie these days since now a days good movie are rare. Anyway thanks for the review and will look forward for more.
