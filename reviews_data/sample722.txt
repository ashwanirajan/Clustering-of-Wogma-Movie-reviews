wogma rating: Watch if you have nothing better to do (?)
Miley Naa Miley Hum ends up being a bland family drama about parents burdening their children with aspirations they have for themselves. It could have been so much better. Oh well...Miley Naa Miley Hum is a launch vehicle for politician, Ram Vilas Paswan's son Chirag Paswan and unfortunately stays just that - carrying on its arms tropy heroine, Kangna Ranaut, of course. The basic plot had the charm to be a warm family film but ends up being a bland, predictable affair, especially post interval.

Chirag Paswan looks sincere but has a long way to go before his face and body learn how to convey what his character feels/wants to say. And I appeal to all dialogue writers, please, please stop giving Kangna Ranaut English lines - pronouncing "career" as "carrier" I'd let go, but "means" as "mince", please have mercy on us! The two saving graces of this otherwise almost debacle are Poonam Dhillon and Kabir Bedi's voice. Actually, Kabir Bedi has a couple of scenes in which his eyes express everything that his otherwise dead expression don't convey throughout the film. 
The basic plot is interesting but with the ridiculous twist midway, it has no surprises or believability left. Had they somehow masked that twist and if there was some chemistry between the lead pair there was half a chance for Miley Naa Miley Hum to be a decent film.
Alas, its just another one of those films that you'll stop at in your channel-surfing mode, just to check out what Ram Vilas Paswan's son looks like.

No readers have rated this movie yet.This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Well, just because he is better than some doesn't make him good. He looked honest, and that's what i said. But nothing more than that, right? This has nothing to do with his genes :DCopyright Â© 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
