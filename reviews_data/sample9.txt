
wogma rating: The keen should rent; else TV/online (?)
As much a story of tender care, as it is a story of social good and dealing with taboo. Worth a watch – for the avoidable struggle a common man went through because of the many social factors – even if not on the big screen. When a friend told me of Arunachalam Muruganantham, I remember being in awe. Just the entire concept was as unexpected as it was amazing. Not only was a man trying to figure menstruation out but he was from the interiors of India where most likely touching a menstruating lady is culturally disallowed, let alone discussing periods.Today, six years later, in an era when a lot of women complain about insensitivity from their men, especially when it comes to menstruation and related issues, Arunachalam truly seems like a superhero. But, his story would have remained in some nook of media, if it weren’t for the star value given to it by Akshay Kumar. Is Akshay Kumar the best person to play this role? Most likely not. Is it great that he is playing it? I’d say, yes. Anything that brings the subject into public discourse is good. If it is done by a public figure, I won’t complain. Sure, it is disheartening that a woman’s cause needs a man as a saviour. But, it is a film based on a true story. And it was a man who disrupted the period industry. So, that’s how life played out. I find it befitting that credit be given where it’s due. That leaves the argument that would a woman who took up this cause receive such recognition - should, but most likely wouldn’t. Maybe a filmmaker will see this injustice too and Padman will pave the way for all those women who  have taken up great causes but have not seen their work gain momentum. As far as the movie goes, save for the fact that it is directed by R. Balki, I don’t think it’ll be any better or worse than Toilet – Ek Prem Katha. In fact, there is a slight chance that star power will overshadow the real man’s work and/or the issue at hand. Even so, whether or not I like the film, here’s sending more power to such enablers. Padman releases on 9 February, 2018.

  Of course, Padman is about a man who cared for the well-being of his wife and sisters. But it would be unfair to think of Padman as just a “period” film. It is as much about rural India, superstitious India, an India that finds breaking away from tradition worse than a death sentence. And I am sure this is true of many countries, not just this one. Societies with families that find it difficult to finance basic needs, but spend that and more on faith – must surely exist outside India too. So even as Padman is about changing the way in which women manage their menstrual flow, it’s reach is far beyond the boundary of this country and the topic of menstruation. I am glad that Arunachalam Muruganantham took up the onus of making affordable sanitary napkins. I am certainly glad there are being films made on the man, his zeal, his persistence, and his invention. And I am equally glad that it got star-backing from Akshay Kumar in Padman. Let alone boys and men, if the film changes the attitude of even a handful of girls and women towards menstruation from the “hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil” to that of, “baah, what’s the big deal”, it is a success – irrespective of box office status. Yes, there are women today who speak about periods much more liberally than when I was growing up. But we are hardly enough. This shocking indicator cannot be repeated enough – only 12% of Indian women use sanitary napkins. As far as the film goes, you can tell that the writing and direction are trying very hard to keep things light. Be it Laxmikant’s (Akshay Kumar) sense of humor or Sonam Kapoor’s bright smile and breezy presence. If that’s what it takes to reach a larger audience, so be it. I was caught off-guard by Akshay Kumar’s performance. From the beginning, he just came across as the simple-minded, progressive villager he is supposed to be. Sonam Kapoor as Pari, Laxmikan’t enterprise partner, fit in well too. In contrast though, Radhika Apte (Laxmikant’s wife) looked a little out of place. Her shame, her helplessness, her concern for the family budget all came across as rather functional, if not superficial. This though is not the actor’s fault. She isn’t the focus of the writing. Neither is Laxmikant. Sure, the other characters are all in relation to him, as in his wife, his partner, his friend, his mother, his sisters, yet he is not the focus. The focus is clearly the story, or to take it a level further – the invention and the social milieu that called for the invention. From financial deprivation to money-and-fame driven attitude, from societal pressure of what’s appropriate and what’s not to a take on faith and religion – everything in Padman revolves around the invention. So, even though the film points at all these issues, it is still a lot about how to make an affordable sanitary napkin, to the extent that at some point I felt like I am taking a repeated, factory tour of a sanitary napkin machine shop. This did get a little repetitive and tedious after a while. And of course, for a film that addresses social taboo around menstruation, it defeated the purpose that “the stain” was still taboo. That’s when you remind yourself that, that’s real life. Despite these issues though, it is good to see this tender, caring, determined man’s road to discovery. I am not sure the extent to which the film sticks to the events of the true life story, but from this TED talk by Arunachalam Muruganantham, the first half looks like it has largely stuck to actuals. Of course, there is the unfathomable move from Tamil Nadu to Madhya Pradesh. Maybe it was to keep things politically correct, who knows? The love angle is another question mark the film left me with. The especially broken English that Laxmikant delivers his speech in, is another one of those cinematic liberties that the film could have done without. Instead it would have been a nice touch to show how the man was approached for the film. But, I guess that would be called chest-thumping. It’s amusing that a film that revolves around the social fatigue of “what will people say?” can’t show a bit of reality because of “what people will say”.On the other hand, Padman has refrained from some common Hindi film traps. For instance, from 20 minutes into the film, I was waiting for Akshay Kumar to burst into a know-it-all, holier-than-thou monologue. But thankfully, they ducked that one. I guess, it helps that real life isn’t about preachy speeches. As with many films based on true-lives, especially those that inspire and have a social cause at the core – it is difficult to separate the cause and the personality from the film. And thus comes the inevitable question – is it enough for us to know about such a life? Or has the film been able to take the public discourse a step further? Will my teenage son and daughter talk more openly about periods with each other; with their friends of the opposite gender? Are they more sensitized? Will you and I consider giving our domestic help a pack of the ironically named “Whisper” with their salary? Will we hide the pack as we give it? Does it cross social boundaries if you almost force them to talk about periods uninhibitedly as we would have our kids talk? This last question, I am sure, is for another film.

The film refers to the elephant in the room without discomforting the viewers as people are still afraid to talk about these topics in the open. R Balki has made a film that not only entertains but also educates the people. It is neither too preachy like Toilet: Ek Prem Katha nor overtly dramatic like PK. The only glitch is the unneeded romantic plot which could have been avoided (won’t spoil it for you). The film is a perfect ode to empowering women which will, in turn, empower India.

But I would still recommend the movie for its frank discussion on what is regarded as a taboo subject in many parts of our country, told in a very conventional (too conventional, I must say) manner.

: Very good and great funny movie
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.The movie is more or less a complete depiction of Mr Arunachalam's life, difficulties, passion bordering on obsession, sincerity.  Although I felt that the film went through very rapidly on his struggles, and focused more on his resilience and innovation.The film is not making any effort to preach about the need for hygienic practices during the menstruation period.  Yes, it has the required amount to highlight the reason for Mr. Arunachalam's fight to find a solution, but thereafter it doesn't touch or preach on the subject.  The film can be categorised as a biography of Mr. Arunachalam.Performance wise the show is shared equally between Akshay Kumar, Radhika Apte and Sonam Kapoor.  Of course Akshay gets the lion's share of the screen time.There are several joyous moments that overflow via the happy tears.  I hope that the money that the film makes is shared with Mr. Arunachalam's cause.  As regards improving hygiene for Indian women during their monthly period, I personally believe that there will be no change - firstly because the majority of the audience who will watch this film are not the audience to be evangelized, and secondly because the audience to be evangelized will not receive any particular message on the subject as that doesn't seem to be the director's aim.The 12% statistics is just that, a statistics.  To begin with, it dates at least from 2001 if not before.  The film itself makes it clear that we are talking about the 2001 period.  Also, the 12% is the percentage of the polled women who replied they used "commercial pads".  The total number of polled women= 1000.  That is not even representative number for a city, let alone a country of half billion women.  Even if we accept 12% of 1000 women who gave this information in 2001 is still the same rate in 2017 and pan-India, it still doesn't mean that 88% of women are using unhygienic means.  Thus the statistics are nice for a friendly discussion in a social party with a glass of red wine.  Whereas if a real improvement is to be made then one needs to go behind such statistics and decipher the real situation.Read more for extra awareness.https://swarajyamag.com/culture/why-india-doesnt-need-the-sanitary-napkin-revolution@Fan I think the more privileged members of audience who do watch the film can take a step and educate the people they encounter in their daily lives to use pads, if they don't or menstrual cups (if that's what they favour). If the sample size was only 1000, then I would think the number of women who use commercial pads would be even fewer. I have had to use a cloth when I began my period for a couple of years. Similarly, I am sure many others do use cloths even now. Why a cloth pad is better than a rag, I know not. But washing your period cloth is not pleasant. And any day I wouldn't wish anyone have to do that! Other than the smell and visual, you are in all sorts of pain, you barely want to move and you have to wash a messy cloth where the stains are hard to get off. In that article, I wonder where the number for sand and ashes at 1% come from. Maybe the same place could give statistics for commercial pad usage.A line from the article says, "....  since such practices have prevailed for hundreds of years. Obviously if such practices were harmful, people would have let it go a long time ago". ^^ What a privileged place to speak from!  I am sure we can make a list of practices that have prevailed for hundreds of year and did not cause any known harm, but we know is not healthy. Open defecation for example. Also how can countering statistics with a "would have" make an argument?Actually, I would view anything written in that article suspiciously, because 'Red Tent' concept  (in the US) is not for menstruating women. As far as I can tell, it is a monthly meeting as per the lunar calendar - a sort-of support group for other problems women face and has nothing to do with "only" periods as such. The article also says things like, "Imagine the drama of telling our rural women to throw away their piece of menstrual cloth and instead use my packaged version of it, which by the way will also cost them." At the same time it scoffs at how the West is not pushing for menstrual cups in India - As far as menstrual cups go, I wonder how one will explain sterilizing the menstrual cup in a rural Indian kitchen?Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
