Ragini MMS has nothing new in the general story or the details, given the genre of supernatural, horror stuff. But it has brilliant performances by both Raj Kumar Yadav and Kainaz Motivala.A scary date movie. The trailer itself is scary and it looks sleazy enough to be a dirty date film, the kinds that has enough making out in it and that makes you hold hands/hug tight because of the terror it creates. 

The home video kind of recording and the Raj Kumar Yadav, give it a huge Love, Sex aur Dhoka. Not to mention the latter has been promoting Ragini MMS from its social media accounts. 
I don't enjoy horror films. They are either funny and not horrifying or they make my skin crawl. So, I'm either laughing out of despair or I'm left with an extremely uncomfortable sensation. But I can't avoid them given the choice of profession. So, if I'm made uncomfortable and want to run away from my seats because I can't take any more of what's going on, on screen, the film will pass my muster. 
From the looks of it, Ragini MMS is all set to get onto my nerves, in a favorable-rating kind-of-a-way. I just hope it's more than just pounding background music, digitized voices and shrill screams. Something tells me that it will be. 
Ps. There were no music reviews out when this article was written.

  Ragini MMS is the same old spooky Hindi, supernatural film. In fact, the first half an hour or so of the film is like you are watching a sleazy, slow B-grade film with crass language and an attempt at overt "sexual" scenes. The only thing that stands the film apart from the rest of the films that fall in this bracket is the awesome performances. 





(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});


The one thing that completely cheeses me off is that these "horror" films have no real story. They titillate and are repititive. They don't really need a set up because even if you hate the character you don't want such bad things to happen to him. If he's that bad you want the punishment under your control maybe and not some mean and grumpy, old ghost. 
That's where the film succeeds. Uday Jhalla is a lousy, cheesy, creepy character and you want him to get away from the spirit. Raj Kumar Yadav squeezes every bit of aversion and later pity out of you. Kainaz Motivala too evokes sympathy through her naiveté and helplessness. 
Despite the bleh first half, some of the spook-inducing decisions made in the second half were freaking awesome. The kind where even 95 minutes seem too long. In this duration it's not because Ragini MMS is a bad film but because you want that claustrophobia to go away. The director has done something right if every time the spirit speaks, my skin crawls. (Or could it be because it kept reminding me of Nandita Das' performance in Chitra Palekar's Marathi film, maati maay"?)
You have to be a horror film lover to enjoy this one. Nope, there is no real titillation in terms of the sexual scenes indicated in the promos.
Oh yeah, and here is my standard horror-film disclaimer. Basically, I can't handle them.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Thank you, G-10!better give the money to some needy and take their blessings rather than wasting your valuable time and money on this bakwas, copy of LSD & Paranormal Hollywood movie and some masala from here and there (Bhulbhulaiya) etc etc. No story, no climax, no conclusion, no moral, you dont know that the movie has ended, only because of titles at the end, the audience get up and walk out dissapointed.
