The tiny step Bharadwaj takes towards Shakespeare is worth an applause, and a second-viewing too. Even so, the writing though has miles to go. 5 years ago, if you would have told me I would look forward to a film because it has Kangna Ranaut in it, without heeding to the fact that it is a Vishal Bharadwaj film that stars Saif Ali Khan too, I would have tried to politely suppress a laughter dying to spurt out. And boy am I glad to be proven wrong, even in this hypothetical situation!Having said that, the love-war-deceit triangle theme, not to mention the love triangle theme has been played out way too many times to demand any interest. Sure, it has the Vishal Bharadwaj touch and that bit piques your interest. But then, you are reminded that a non-Shakespeare adaptation by the man is only so interesting. This makes expectations for Rangoon perfectly balanced, ready to be tipped on either side come Febraury 24th.Music Reviews:

  Boy meets girl. Uninteresting. But that changes quickly if the circumstances they meet under are intriguing. That the boy and girl fall for each other is a given. But their conflicts with the rest of the world can charge things up. Rangoon does this in fits and starts. That too is enough to keep you glued. The house of cards falls though when the story has to be wrapped up. The last 20-25 minutes of Rangoon are a fine example of out-of-characteristically abysmal writing. Something that was meant to break your heart, makes your eyes roll instead with a mind that's crying, “et tu, Bharadwaj?”A story is supposed to answer a, “What if?” “What if Quentin Tarantino made Inglourious Basterds as a musical.” Rangoon, the film - not its story – tries to answer that question in the first half hour. As intentional as the nod to Tarantino is, this interesting and amusing “what if”, is not one that takes the plot forward. Then there are other musical pieces that remind you of Gulaal. I am not sure if that was intentional. But, the comment on the clash of political ideologies is apparent.  And anyway, it doesn't take the story forward.Now considering Rangoon encompasses a love triangle, a war of ideologies and the World War II, it is a lot of time spent on not moving the story forward. This is why, the last half hour becomes a little more tedious than it might have been with fewer tangents. However, another way to look at it would be that the three characters who make the triangle are so intriguing that you want to see more of them. Each one of them is strong-headed. Each one of them helpless in love. Each of them grey and complex. Yes, surely we want more of them.Of course, that wouldn't have worked out had it not been for the actors. Saharsh Shukla to Satoru Kawaguchi to the lead actors Kangna Ranaut, Saif Ali Khan, Shahid Kapoor – all are remarkable. The lead actors specifically make their vulnerabilities transparent to the audience's eye. The actors' eyes showing strength and power to defy that vulnerability even as they succumb to the ones they love. Yet, they are not clones of each other.  Even if the intensity with which they love might be the same – if love can be measured at all, that is – the priorities change with time and situation. And because of the way it is played out by the actors, as an audience, you can tell how they are going to react. This has a feeling of being consistent with the character rather than predictable. The chemistry between Shahid Kapoor and Kangna Ranaut is palpable, that between the latter and Saif Ali Khan is appropriately cold or comfortable. If you were to strip down the tangents, this story is about stunt-woman Julia. Sure, a character of such strength, especially physical, is usually a male in most films. That highlight aside, what made it even more precious is almost everything about the story is about two women – Julia and India. Ironically, many a love triangle with two men and a woman are more about the men than the woman. Many a film about patriotism are more about the men protecting the country and very little about the country herself. The women on the pedestal are taken rather for granted in the story. A lot of Rangoon is about Julia, her experiences and her reactions to those experiences. There is a psychological undercurrent of her nomadic beginnings leading to an insecurity she hides within. The countries too are given some consideration, through foreign rulers admiring the rich culture, through acts on stage. Other than that the non-glamorous war and action scenes (barring a few badly done CGI ones), the scenes without a background score, the music when it's there, the songs, the long shots and close-ups all take you into their world. A world strife with war. And yet looks like a beautiful scar on an otherwise untainted body. A war within which love finds vigour. A world where Vishal Bharadwaj tries to enter Shakespearean territory of tragic, complex characters - irrespective of whether or not he succeeds completely. A world I would certainly visit again. Maybe with a pen in hand, even if imaginary, scratching off parts from the reel that would have made the movie crisper. Maybe coming back home imagining an alternate end for the film.

The love triangle, which is the basic plot device of the movie, doesn’t overpower the other proceedings in the movie. Yes, more time should have been delved in the freedom struggle movement. Eventually, Rangoon delivers a crisp second half which almost negates the slow first half of world building. Lovers of serious cinema who want a bit of meat in their movies, should definitely check out Rangoon because movies of this sort are few and far in between. If entertainment is what you seek out of films, then Rangoon isn’t for you.

Muchonwalihansa:
          #Rangoon is basically poor man's "1942 A Love Story". Excellent acting, but weak screenplay and editing
        
i_Prathit:
          #Rangoon the filmmaking style was more like Hollywood. It's grandeur and fascinating. Wish the script was more convincing.
        
ishtkam:
          In Rangoon, Vishal Bhardwaj strives to pull off what may well be his most ambitious film yet. https://t.co/vl0GQi7wiS

hkhaja02:
          War movie like "RANGOON" has made a good effort but cannot Compete with War Movies of Hollywood which creates Terrific impact.#Bollywood

Rangoon: At Best Watchable https://t.co/CaFUKy4qsr

Arvind_jkt:
          #Rangoon surely Kangana's film. Very well acted by her but slow at times. Bit of a drag. I think Vishal Bhardwaj could have done better.

svhvjb:
          Vishal Bhardwaj is at his best when he's adapting Shakespeare. Rangoon was a swing and a miss.
        
SushantBSinha:
          #Rangoon देख कर मुँह से निकलता है 'Bloody Hell'  क्यों बर्बाद किए पैसे

sambit_dash:
          Haven't watched a more terrible second half like #Rangoon in recent times. Industry stalwarts like Bhardwaj shouldn't be doing this.
        
Ritikajain09:
          Shocked beyond words! Such a bad film with such fantastic cast and that too from #Vishalbhardwaj

parekhm:
          #Rangoon is pathetic - does not engage you for even 10 minutes in the entire 3 hours. There is no sign of Vishal Bharadwaj in the film!
        
Pallavisms:
          Despite having a brilliant plot as its subject: Bose's INA's fight for Indian independence, Rangoon is a disaster of a movie! Such a letdown

          Movie success is credited to publicity. No worthy substance = TRASH #rangoon what a waste of talent, money and time.

          Watched Rangoon last night. Apart from them performances, there's nothing to write home about. Mediocre screenplay. Meandering plot.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.A love story set in the midst of World War II and India's struggle for freedomA love story set in the midst of World War II and India's struggle for freedom
The role of the bottle of opium in disclosing the secret: very Shakesperean   
The mixing of border on the world map in the stage act   
skipped it since quite a lot of  viewer reviews on BMS mentioned it makes for a tedious watch..now with ur review, think i'll give it a chance.Did you watch "Hidden figures" ??? ...or Split ? or "Hero"  ....If u got time only for one, i'd say "Hidden figures"...a predictable feel good movie but Taraji is in her elements and that makes it worth your time, but the standout performer of the week would be James Mcvoy in Split...just brilliant ! ..not gripping enough in terms of plot or script though. 5 movies in the space of 3 days..people think i am going mad :D@fanofcfc8 Do let me know what you think. 5 movies in 3 days. Sounds like a mini-film festival of your own. Let people think what they think, kuchh toh log kahenge, logo ka kaam hai kehna, right?DISASTER right from the word go! Right from the dull promos to the uninspiring music, RANGOON is a catastrophe of magnanimous proportions. Even psycho pseudo feminist queen's black magic cannot save this turkey. I still wonder why producers are interested in making magnamopous films worth 100's of crores with over rated disastrous film makers like Vishal Bharadwaj & Anurag Kashyap whose films never sell more than 50 Lakh tickets in the best case scenario, irrespective of the movie's cast, genre and content.Disappointed! Really a boring movie which cannot be watched in theatres.Apart from the moments involving shahid n Kangana, i was bored...The lavish sets or cinematography kind of make it difficult for me to relate or emotionally connect with its characters..Just like you point out in many of your reviews, i just couldn't see past the stars that they are...it was shahid, saif and kangana for as long as i watchedCopyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.

Parental Guidance:


Violence: A war film, so loads of it.
Language: Some abusive Hindi words spoken with a foreign accent making them almost unrecognisable.
Nudity & Sexual content: A few making out scenes, liplocks and lip-to-lips included.
Concept: A love story set in the midst of World War II and India's struggle for freedom
General Look and Feel: The 40s done well. Gritty war scenes.
