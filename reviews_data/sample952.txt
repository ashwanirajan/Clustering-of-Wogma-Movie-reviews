
wogma rating: Add to 'must watch' list (?)
A relaxed pace is used to get into details of the protagonist's relationship with his lover and himself. Unfortunately, they forget that they are supposed to maintain the depth because of which the same pace now seems sluggish. 
However, the twist is indeed worth the time because it's not 100% predictable. If nothing else Farhan Akhtar's ace performance is something you will relish for quite a while.

However, the twist is indeed worth the time because it's not 100% predictable. If nothing else Farhan Akhtar's ace performance is something you will relish for quite a while. The good news is that the film doesn't suffer from the first half-second half syndrome. The bad news is that it follows a bell-curve. It starts out real bad, gets very interesting, peaks and ends not only in jiffy but rather sloppily. Fortunately, the film is sprinkled with dialogues that are witty and crisp.

The set-up is ordered with an over-dose of everything - an extra aggressive landlord who asks for extra rent for an extra small place; an extra-ordinarily hostile work environment that immediately reminds you of Rocket singh; an exceptionally mild protagonist Karthik (Farhan Akhtar) who everyone throws around. O-kay, got the point. So low and down is Karthik's life that the only way it can go is up. By now despite all the exaggeration, you begin to care for him. You want him to slap all the people around him - real hard. And he does. 40 minutes of this 140 minuter are done with. 
This is when it gets interesting. Obviously, a thriller is a thriller if you can't tell why is the character going through this. But, I like the ones in which you can't tell despite it staring you in the face. Of course, anyone can guess 95% of what's happening, but the next 5% comes as a surprise. Unfortunately, though you should've gone through a "aaaah, like that" moment what you feel is "blah!" when the mystery unfolds. 
However, the romantic relationship between Karthik and Shonali (Deepika Padukone) is explored in quite some detail and is extremely engaging. It touches upon girls wanting nice and safe guys to misbehave. :) The contrast between the two characters is set-up nicely too. One avoids mobile phones because for him they were invented to plague his health. The other smokes. One enters the office along with the cleaners, the other around lunch-time. Despite this the romance is believable and done in a jiffy compared to the pace of the rest of the film.
Farhan plays the simple man whose world revolves around his job and his love interest (no rhyming words for nokri aur chhokri in English) to perfection. In my mind, he's still a director, but you see this man act and want to see every project he's involved in. The best bit is when Karthik gets into the loop and falls into a self-fulfulling prophecy. What is confusing to the entire world is plain and clear to him. 
Deepika too does a good job of playing out the hesitation Shonali goes through before getting into a relationship And that bit is consistent in the writing too, but then there is nothing more left to explore in the character. Except, at times, she shifts gear as if she's talking to a child. Even the "I love you"s!
The film has an exaggerated tone of gray in the gloomy situations, which makes the use of ambience a bit too in the face. So is the use of the Rubik's cube. True it has been used as a motif and a metaphor for what's happening with Karthik. But these things are supposed to be left to interpretation not shoved down the audience's throat. Let's not even get to the hurried way in which the technical aspects of the subject are handled - in a rush hoping the audience won't notice.
Like I said, I'd watch the film just for Farhan's performance. And don't forget the concept is more than half-interesting. It's just a bit too long and yet left unexplained.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Warning: this section has some details that could distort your experience while watching the movie. I strongly recommend reading this only after you have seen the movie or if you have decided not to see it.Timid Karthik (Farhan Akhtar) is taken advantage of by all and sundry. It's time he stood up for himself. And so he does, or does he?Timid Karthik (Farhan Akhtar) is taken advantage of by all and sundry. It's time he stood up for himself. And so he does, or does he?
Lovely titles - the flicker in each name along with the soft edits set the tone of the film nicely.
The sequence where you see Karthik going through depression.
The chemistry between Farhan Akhtar and Deepika Padukone's fingers.

Krathik's dream/nightmare.
After years of therapy all Karthik's shrink (Shifaali) can tell him is to stand up for himself. Lady, if he could have done that, wouldn't he have done it already? Please don't tell me that one line triggered the whole scheme.
The Ashish-Shonali break-up - ridiculous
Shonali wasn't ready to go out with Karthik. But when she is ready, she is ok to be taken away to Khandala!?
Even if you digest the dramatic, over-night change in one of the characters given the situation…You want to yell "mummy…!!!" because at that point in the film (that is before you have seen the rest of the film) it's nauseating. 
I dont know but I dont like the movie at all. What is this! [...comment edited because it gives the movie away...]is it kind of hostel comedy?@sunny Thank you. This kind of feedback always means a lot. :)@dffdf didn't get you? sorry, can you tell me what's confusing?@Anand I haven't given away anything more than the trailers. Believe me, there's a lot more going on in the film than what is mentioned here. Thank you!!!@seema no-no. you need to make your own mistakes and learn out of them :P@Geet Thank you!! at your service now and hopefully always.A lot of my friends, infact all of my friends except one, were disappointed with the movie. They thought it was obvious. But like you said, it was not 100% obvious the way it happened!I would agree with your ratings on almost all aspects, and I think it was a good movie simply made. The song has become an earworm for many :)However, I do not quite think the actors deserved a good rating. Farhan was better than his acts in 'Lucky (or a movie like that)', and Deepika was just about mediocre. Had there been actors with a little more life, they would have rightly deserved 4 out of 5. So there I think you over-rated them to 4.5... but its your review, and your point of view :)Overall, it was a pretty decent watch, at least for me in a theater.@Aditto Hey! The movie was certainly above average. I loved Farhan Akhtar's acting, the smart-Alec Karthik must have been easy for him, but the timid one must have taken its toll. And there are some things that Deepika does really well, not all the time necessarily.Thanks a bunch. Ran across this excellent post when I was googling for these links.
