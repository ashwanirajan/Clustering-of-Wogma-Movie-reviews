It's longer, it's snazzier, it's louder but it's not funnier or better. Sure, it makes you laugh a few times, but it loses the plot and goes over the top more number of times. Besides it doesn't offer anything new in terms of simpleton vs. the "classier" people. We have seen Vinay Pathak play that avoidable co-passenger both in the first episode of Bheja Fry and recently in Chalo Dilli. He was brilliant and surely we can see more of that, if it is coming from him. But the situations will have to be better and unpredictable to maintain the tempo and viewer interest. More so because it is a sequel. We are all skeptical about them and for good reason. The promos aren't helping either - 

Sure, Bheja Fry was slapsticky too, but it was the good kind. A spitting competition on the other hand doesn't make me laugh at all. It worries me. To top it off, you have Vinay Pathak being loud, in a scarily Akshay-Kumar-kind-of-a-way. But hopefully, just 15 seconds of a film aren't enough to call a film bad and the situation this scene is set in justifies what we see here. 
Another worrisome factor is the inclusion of songs. Though I thoroughly enjoyed the one I have embedded below, the others are disconcerting. 

The first film was supposedly a copy of a French film, hopefully this one is not a copy. Or if it is one, at least they have given credit as appropriate this time around. Nevertheless, the first one was fun and I hope this one is too. fingers crossed

HappySing - "Bheja Fry is almost as it could and should have been, and while the sounds are fun without the movie as well, they will hopefully fit well in the movie."

  Anyone going in expecting a Bheja Fry - Part 2 will be disappointed. Anyone going in expecting laugh-out-loud comedy will be disappointed. The only people who have any hope of being satisfied are the Vinay Pathak believers. That too, is more of the same. But we'll make do since we've paid for the ticket.

This is a serious case of give him too much money, and your disciplined child will become a spoilt brat. You have your aerial shots and cruise ships and remote island locales. It’s cool, it's great even. But just for the sake of creating a situation which sounded great in your head? Especially the regional jokes were the least funny of them all! 
I don't know if it's a boon that Vinay Pathak is around to save the film or a curse that he spent time on it. Kay Kay Menon would have sleep walked through Bheja Fry 2 in his amateur days (if there is anything  like that for him, that is.) Amongst the rest you have Minissha Lamba in the first half and Amole Gupte in the second. She is clueless and he is loud, deafeningly loud. 
Amole Gupte's character is equally out of place too. In fact, everything in the second half just goes over-the-top. It becomes like a Tom and Jerry show, waiting to become funny. Or just getting stuck in admiring the brilliant simpleton vs. snotty idea that they had in the first film, and not knowing how to milk it further. 
Dear Mr. Ballary, if I want to see a senseless, plotless film that wants to make me laugh and fails miserably. I have my guaranteed avenues. I don't want precious money reserved for smaller films spent on that kind of tripe. New tripe, I'm ready for.  But the same thing over, na-ah.
It hurts, you know? I mean, it's fantabulous and all that jazz when independent filmmakers get more money to make their films after a good first show. It's even better to have a Vinay Pathak on screen. Heaven knows how much I love seeing him over a moustache that is the only muscle moving on an actor's face. Or a dimple. But it hurts, and you know not how, when a Ready makes me laugh a little more than a Vinay Pathak-Kay Kay Menon film.

yashrocks09:
          Bheja Fry 2 was dissappointing. Vinay pathak was delight to watch as bhushan once again, the 'ha ha ha ha' laugh and breifcase lock habit.
