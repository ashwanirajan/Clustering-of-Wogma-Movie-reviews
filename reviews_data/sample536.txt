Had the apple seen Son of Sardaar first, it would never have fallen on Newton’s head. Talking about the film is as predictably pointless as the film itself. The exaggerated action sequences and silly comedy may entertain some of the audience, but as a film-crazy nation, we surely deserve far better. Better known as a dialogue writer than a director, Ashwani Dhir directs his third film, Son of Sardaar - this Diwali's quota of comedy. It looks more slapsticky and the typical over-the top that goes with it. Ajay Devgn seems to be playing a macho character but goes wimpy when confronted by Sanjay Dutt. With Sonakshi Sinha as lead lady, we can forget all about entertainment in the form of dance because the woman has a knack of juicing the grace out of dance. Just take a look at this! Interestingly, the only thing that comes through from the trailers about the story is that Ajay Devgn's character has offended Sanjay Dutt's character somehow and the latter is just bidding time before he can lay his hands on the former. And in the process everyone overacts. Nothing in whatever we've been exposed to thus far seems to indicate that we are in for any coherent plot. It is after all, earmarked to be that kind of non-sensical extravaganza.However, not all seems to be lost as you see some attempt at acting in this song called 'Bichhdan'. Also, there is a promise of relief in the form of Juhi Chawla, but she too can give into excess like some of her adverts show. Yet, there is only so much hope you can have from a film starring Ajay Devgn and Sanjay Dutt that has to rely on Salman Khan to sell the film. Is this what we have come down to? Really?Anyway, this one is unapologetically going to thrown in a lot of Punjabi cliches, starting right from the title, promos and down to each song!Music Reviews:

  If the missing vowel in ‘Ajay Devgn’ has been puzzling you, you must know that his company’s name is Ajay Devgn Ffilms. Yes, the double-F in ‘ffilms’ is not a typo. Clearly, ffilm people seem to assume that India’s collective IQ dives far south during the festive season. While that may not be entirely false, I am sure that at least logic and the laws of physics are a tad bit more universal than the buffoonery that some of our big, festive releases subject us to. Mildly amusing at best and capable of inducing seizures at its worst, Son of Sardaar is the kind of film that will exhaust all synonyms of the word ‘silly’ and come out grinning, proud of its existence for reasons that the more discerning amongst us will find difficult to fathom.The plot (I’m being mighty generous by using that word for this film) has something to do with a generations-old bloodthirsty family feud that has kept Jassi (our hero, Ajay Devgn) the last surviving member of the Randhawa clan, away from India for 25 years. He returns to stake claim on his ancestral land, blissfully unaware that while he may no longer hold grudges, his arrival has been long-awaited by the Sandhu clan, led by Balvinder Singh Sandhu aka Billu, played by Sanjay Dutt. You see, Billu walked out of his own wedding 25 years back, swearing to kill every last member of the Randhawas before he gets married. If the plot seems as old as the hills, the treatment is, expectedly, as juvenile as it can get.I must confess that when I even begin to think of the sheer volume of braindead-ery this film contains, I feel like I’m being an obsessive-compulsive maniac, because clearly there is an audience out there for this kind of film. I refuse to believe, however, that exaggerated action and comedy must necessarily entail you to treat yourself like you don’t own a brain for two-and-a-half hours of your life. Not surprisingly, stereotypical jokes about the intellect of the Sikhs abound in this film. In fact, the whole film is set in a village full of dunderheads, not all of whom are Sikh. I often wondered if the point of the film was to show that anyone living in Punjab uses his brain as sparingly as the people behind this film. For a film that has comedy as one of its two primary ‘pillars’, the jokes are mainly banal, lent credibility sporadically because the actors delivering the lines aren’t half bad. The film’s other supposed pillar is the action, which is also one of the weakest bits. Apart from the fact that they don’t seem to feel even slightly original and visionary, some of the execution is just tacky. CG-generated fake skies don’t help in any way.If people find the film even slightly watchable, it is because of the actors. Ajay Devgn is goofy and endearing; Sanjay Dutt has a frightening yet charming air about him and Sonakshi Sinha, who seems to want to only do films that look like they’ll make it into that ridiculous ‘club’ of you-know-how-many crores, is actually passably pleasant in the bits that don’t require her to pretend like she is dancing with gay abandon. Mukul Dev, fresh out of cold storage, has a couple of silly lines that work quite well. The pick of the cast, though, is Juhi Chawla, who seems to be the only sensible character in the village-with-no-IQ.This Diwali, Son of Sardaar is clearly the greater of two evils, though there is no doubt that the film is going to entertain the audience in smaller centers to the hilt. For people who liked Rowdy Rathore, Bodyguard and the likes, congratulations – chances are you’ll like this one too. For others, I think I have made the point amply clear.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.The promo doesnt impress much, seems another stupid comedy by Ajay Devgan and a dumb remake of a telugu film, may work afterall a diwali release....Ajay Devgan's comedy films never impressed me so far... I didnt find Golmaal 3 funny... a big torture actually....Lets see if it wins the clash over JTHJ@Silvan yeah, I don't like those kind of comedies either. Don't know about winning over Jab Tak Hai Jaan, I just hope we get to watch two good films this Diwali."With Sonakshi Sinha as lead lady, we can forget all about entertainment in the form of dance because the woman has a knack of juicing the grace out of dance."That was quite a strong comment :P or may be it sounds so only because I seem to enjoy her lack of imhibitions for those crazy moves which clearly belong to the 80s ;)) can't think of another leading lady today who dances with such abandon (except for Anushka, maybe)@Harsh Does one have to let go of grace while dancing to do so with abandon? To me she makes the dance look disgusting. I have caught myself looking the other way when she's on screen in this particular one.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
