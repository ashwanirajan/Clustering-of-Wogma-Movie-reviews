Calling itself Chaar Din Ki Chandni (roughly translating to the English phrase 9 days' wonder) is pretty presumptuous because it implies that it did have something that lasted 4 days or 9 depending on which phrase you prefer. Chaar Din Ki Chandni is a lot of ado about nothing at all. And it doesn't intend to be anything more than nothing either. Chaar Din Ki Chandni is one of the films that make you wonder 'Why did they bother?' or at least 'Why did you bother watching it?' Exasperating and as repeatedly pointed out by Anupam Kher's character - loud and garish - Chaar Din Ki Chandni gets on your nerves almost from the moment the director introduces himself as the narrator, that is scene 1.

And loud and garish pretty much describes each character and the over-the-top performance each actor uses to demonstrate the particular idiosyncrasy assigned to their character. From Anupam Kher, Om Puri, and Farida Jalal to Sushant Singh, Chandrachur Singh, Mukul Dev and Rahul Singh. 
The few exceptions are Anita Raj, Tusshar Kapoor, Kulraj Randhwa and surprisingly Johnny Lever. That doesn't mean Johnny Lever isn't loud, it just means his earsplitting voice is at least justifiable considering what his character has faced. Similarly, Tusshar Kapoor's non-loudness is only relative. And he is mildly amusing when he dons the avatar of a sardar. 
That just leaves Anita Raj and Kulraj Randhwa who are the only respite from this otherwise insufferable thing masquerading around as a film. 
The story is the ages-old one about family not approving of a partner that their son has fallen in love with. The sub-plots are contrived and stretched beyond tolerable; and kills the joke in the couple of times there could've been a decent one. Mistaken identities, blatant cover-ups, and a hundred white lies later the plot is so convoluted that you are left with no emotion to attach to the characters or the plot. What with every man in the disapproving family falling for the disapproved woman - head over heels and vulgar in turns - à la but nothing like Hrishikesh Mukherjee's Naram Garam. She of course, is brilliant at exactly the same thing that each of the four men are interested in - guns, alcohol, whatever say you. The exuberant, all-knowing woman that she is. 
I wonder if the latest courses in story-writing and acting have a separate chapter on the ever-spirited, boisterous yet cultured charmer of a woman that our films invariably have these days. 
Whether or not they have that, they surely don't have a chapter on thinking long and hard about the name you give your film. The Hindi phrase Chaar Din Ki Chandni is the first part of Chaar Din Ki Chandni, phir andheri raat which translates to 'Four days' of good times (moonlit nights), and then ensues darkness'; very much like the phrase '9 days' wonder'. The lead character is called Chandni, certainly they didn't mean what the title implies for their lead character. Or is this one of those clear cases of viewer spending more time reading into the script than the makers spent on reading it?

Aman_kumar7:
          Enjoyed the pace & grip of 'Kahaani'. Outstanding act by Vidya. 4 stars. 'Char Din Ki Chandni' was ok. Falls apart a bit. 'The Vow' decent
        
_sameershah:
          Criminal waste of time&money-accompanied; a frnd for 4 Din Ki Chandni. Absolute CRAP. Tushar-#epicfail. Don't watch even if u get free tkts!
        
UntamedBachelor:
          Char din ki chandni was such a bad movie that I took a ciggi after some 2 years :p

          Kahaani - awessom movie. Must Watch. Char din ki chandni - worst ever. yeah i have watched both of them.

          If movies could kill, this one would cause genocide - Chaar Din Ki Chandni {http://x.vu/240090} *Viewer discretion advised*
        
sapanv:
          If Tusshar Kapoor's Chaar Din Ki Chandni lasts for anything more than four days, Paan Singh Tomar must come back to life and take revenge.

          Kahaani 4.25 mirchis
Chaar Din Ki Chandni 2 mirchis
        
rajivvijayakar:
          In 3 days, 2 losses - Ravi & Joy Mukerji, National awards for Vidya & Chillar Party, & a deadly (Kahaani) & boring film (4 Din Ki Chandni).
        
R0yal_Bengali:
          [email protected]: The current TOI film critics are more generous than Nikhat Kazmi ... Gave 3 stars to Chaar din ki Chaandni.

          This Chaar Din Ki Chaandni is the Hum Tum Shabana of 2012. #Facepalm
        
mytakeonflicks:
          Thanks to movies like Jodi Breakers and Char Din ki Chandni, we gave Paan Singh Tomar and Kahaani their due credit.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.@Anuj I usually try to keep my spirits high with the review when I've watched an exceptionally bad film which Chaar Din Ki Chandni is. But, I usually try to be very serious in the 'Parental Guidance' section because parenting is a tough one - very difficult to say what might be ok with one parent and not the other. So from memory I try to be as complete at possible. Inadvertently as it may be, I'm glad it brought a smile.@Anuj I wouldn't take my kids to either of them. Both had brutal, inhuman violence!@Anuj They are 10 and 8. :D The censor boards inconsistencies are beyond comprehension. :(@Anuj Barring the innuendos and sexual references, I think Ra.One was alright. Certainly not as bad as (or like you say worse than) some of the CN/Pogo stuff I've seen. :)@Anuj I remember watching this horrible cartoon show based on what looked like stories from Panchatantra with horrible 'moral stories', dialogue, dialogue delivery. Only cute thing was that each story was in a different Indian accent. :D Have you watched shin-chan and the likes?We watched Anand with the kids recently and our next project is Sholay. Really curious how they'll react to Sholay. 'Mr. India' is a good suggestion.They do show T&J; and stuff like that too, but there is a lot of other tripe. There are some new good shows too.Sholay, with parental guidance should be ok. They have seen voldemort, so gabbar should be manageable. Let's see how it goes. :DI tried showing them E.T. a couple of years ago, they didn't take to it, it scared them somehow. You just gave me an idea, show them JADOO and then take them to E.T.! tada!!Have read "The Blue Umbrella" to them. I've to watch "Makdee" myself!Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.

Parental Guidance:


Violence: A group of four beating up one person and a couple of slaps.
Language: Lots of innuendoes
Nudity & Sexual content: Implied vulgarity
Concept: A couple lying their way through to convince one's father that they should  get married.
General Look and Feel: Loud and garish
