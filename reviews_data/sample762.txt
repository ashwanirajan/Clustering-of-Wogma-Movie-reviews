
wogma rating: Switch channels if it's on cable (?)
Phhir is one of those films where I want my main review to be the quick review. It's taxing when everything you have to say about a film is bad. It's not scary, it's not thrilling. It beats its own purpose and is just bad. I'd like to just say, "switch channels if it's on cable!" and get away with it. But, oh well...A medium - the person used by the paranormal to communicate - is trying to convince a doctor that she can use her mystical powers to find his missing wife. He tells her that makes no sense. She says, "Do you want logic or wife?" And that pretty much sums up what the writer wants to tell us, "Do you want logic or movie?" For example, this medium person can sense stuff by touching people on TV screens but not sense a walking-talking spirit.

The proceedings are slow, the acting is bad. Everytime Adah Sharma said, "I am a medium." I felt like saying out loud, "well, you look like a large." Yep, that bad! And it's sad because one scene Adah Sharma had in 1920 is etched in my memory for the way it spooked me. But here, nothing is spooking or even remotely thrilling. The attempt at creating mystery with all the non-linear back and forth was unnecessary and rather amusing after a point, unintentionally of course. 
The background score is noisy. In "tense" situations, there was this weird competition between tamsoma sadgamaya and loud Bollywoody-hip-hop music that said "maahi ve", no less! I am no filmmaker, neither do I aspire to be, but I really want to understand the psyche behind this decision. 
But then, I'd want to understand why this film was made in the first place. If it were to make us aware of the power of the supernatural, it defies its purpose. The supernatural was warning against all the wrong things, all through the film. 
Unfortunately, the production values of the film are so bad that you cannot even have fun laughing at the film. It's not like we haven't seen worse but it surely is one of those that you should make a point to save yourself from.

SudhishKamath:
          Phhir: What happens when you put a bunch of non actors together and make the audience read their face. Social experiment.  Dozed off. WTF/10
        
realmaharaja:
          So Phhir is terrible movie. Minus one and a half stars. Would leave now but it's raining.

          Vikram Bhatt is at it again.  As a producer this time.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Kabir's wife Sia goes missing. Disha who has a sixth sense that makes her see...no, not dead people...things she hasn't witnessed physically, wants to help him find her. Kabir's wife Sia goes missing.

Some of the scenes with stop motion.

Why was the newsreader leaning towards the camera so awkwardly?
"Mediums" can communicate by touching a person on the TV screen!?
The animated feather. Yikes!
