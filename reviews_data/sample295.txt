A seemingly sad and touching story that doesn't stir you from within.At first glance, Citylights comes across as a run-of-the-mill helpless villagers caught in the big bad world kind-of-a-film, which it still might be. But, there is something about the performances that hooks you in those two minutes. The couple's desperation comes across rather crudely and therein lies the ironical and rugged charm.It is surely a depressing tale. Now even if it has a happy ending after all, the process of getting there doesn't look too easy for both the characters and the audience. On the other hand, the situations seem very typical, guy is insulted, slapped around and resorts to something he had never thought himself capable of and the woman is insulted, humiliated and resorts to selling her flesh and thus soul. I just hope that like the trailer, the movie is able to take us beyond the "no great shakes" feel that the story and situations give. Through the performances and through some good music and that something little more. That this is a film under the Bhatt banner doesn't help its case too much now, does it?Music Reviews:

  A couple from deep inside Rajasthan loses all hopes of a livelihood in their village and move to the city of hopes, Mumbai. Given the texture of the film, you know they are going to suffer. A lot. Before they get any respite, if at all. Now, we know where this is going and so have to heavily bank on the details of how this comes about and the performances. One delivers, the other not that much. There's no better way to put this - the difficulties in the lives of Deepak (Rajkummar Rao) and Rakhee (Patralekha) come to easily. Yes, given their value system they are asked to do pretty horrendous things. But, you don't see their resistance. You don't see them looking for better options before stooping low (by their own standards). This is where I lost interest in the film, despite liking the pace at which things were playing out. Then I wondered if it was because Deepak and Rakhee were made out to be generalizations of all immigrants into a city. While some times such stereotypes work, at most times the cliché has to work harder to create an impact. And to that end, Citylights was doing nothing. Every once in a while, it becomes the story of this particular person, Deepak. And at those times, it does engage, but quickly it slips back into being this sad story of how people from outside the city are so gullible and the city is out to get them.I am not going to go into the argument of whether or not all non-city-dwellers are more or less unaware of how the world works and that all city-dwellers are out their to dupe the former. For I believe at some level, we all want to believe that nothing bad will happen to us and when we smarten up it changes to, I'm smarter now, so nothing bad will happen to me. Similarly, all of us will agree to cheat when push comes to shove. The only problem is that you are not convinced that push has come to shove in Deepak and Rakhee's case. The only thing keeping the film interesting then is the performances. Rajkummar Rao and Manav Kaul are thoroughly engaging, especially Manav Kaul. It might have to do more with his character too. The shade of grey, his frustration and reasons for doing what he does are all interesting. Patralekha on the other hand does well with what she's asked to do. How I wish her character had better depth for it to explore her acting skills. Then you have the background score and the songs. They both hinder instead of help. Somehow, the film's ambience isn't congruous with the music. The music by itself is pretty mediocre too. They sounded more like they belonged to a Bhatt film while they were in a setting that wanted to be in the Aamir zone.That I think is the bane. Citylights tries to be two things at the same time for some things that cannot go together. True it keeps the setting real and the performances support that theme. But, other than that, it doesn't engage. Just because a film is morose and grim, it doesn't qualify as one that reaches out to you deep within. It is not good enough to have realistic setting and performances. The story has to make you believe too. That is what Citylights misses.

A befitting commentary on social exploitation, the film’s humane touch and the expressive treatment catapults it to a different league. But mostly I find it hard to not sing praises of Raj Kumar Rao whose superlative work gives the film it’s mettle. I ordinarily was going to go with a 3 but for Raj Kumar’s brilliance I am giving this one a 3.5/5. Industry has found an heir to Irrfan Khan and when it comes from a fan, understand that he is a keeper....

Given the pace and mood of the film, the use of Raju Singh’s background score alone would have been far more effective. But these minor issues are settled by strong performances, even in the minor roles. Rajkumar proves that when it comes to acting, less could well be more. He communicates as much with his subdued, diffident body language—the way he sits on his haunches—as he does with his face. You can’t help not feel for him. Manav, as his senior, has a more flamboyant, show-stealing character, the kind who makes evil look incredibly attractive. The two are in stark contrast—innocent and gullible as against street-smart and manipulative—yet in perfect sync with each other. It’s interesting to see that instead of any visible upmanship, the two actors complement each other and help bring out the other’s traits. So far, they make the best couple in Bollywood this year....

          Watched #Citylights movie. Not a feel good one. Well made. So so experience
        
karachikhatmal:
          Just saw #CityLights. The film could've benefited from tighter editing but absolutely superb acting from the two male leads.
        
Greyllusionist:
          #Citylights, a tight film which is not gripping enough. Could have been a little shorter & crisper. @mehtahansal

Vijaydinanathh:
          watch "Citylights" at your Own risk ..   
        
UnsocialShadow:
          Really disappointed with #citylights. Wonder why I read so many gushing reviews of the movie...
        
swapnilk27:
          Late night show... Slow and depressing movie... 'Sone De' keeps playing on the loop. 
*entire audience goes off to sleep*
#Citylights
        
shrutideora:
          The only thing I liked about #Citylights was the fact that they gave due credit to the original film, unlike most of our movies. Well done!
        
shivom_oza:
          CityLights felt incomplete. Didn't move me at all. The only part I liked about the film was the twist at the end. Rest, quite tepid. :-I
        
sauravbhanot:
          Saw #CityLights and came out feeling rather underwhelmed! The film, though nicely made and well enacted, is rather slow. not worth the hype!
        
RoaringShukla:
          #Citylights worst movie I've seen in a long time. No story buildup. A long dreary drag.

qwerty_ed:
          #Citylights avoidable. Very weak story.
        
preci0so:
          #CityLights - slow, incoherent narration, weak storyline. Only saving grace: controlled and mature acting by Patralekha and Rajkumar Rao!
        
PiratedSardar:
          Citylights was such a nice movie in the first half and then bollywood happened.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Direction: 3    Story: 3    Lead Actors: 3.5    Character Artists: 3    Dialogues: 3    Screenplay: 3    Music Director: 0.5    Lyrics: 0.5A typical noir film.  The protagonists just get sucked into more and more difficulties no matter what they do.  And there's my personal paradox; it's well made and even better performed by all the actors - but I just can't stand a noir film. Movies must entertain me and not leave me depressed. So: no rating from me as I will give a negative rating if I follow my heart; and I will give a positive rating if I follow my mind.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
