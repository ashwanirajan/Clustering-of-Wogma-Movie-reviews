
wogma rating: Watch if you have nothing better to do (?)
Desi Boyz is exactly what you'd expect. Awful acting by good-looking people who look really good. A 'whatever' story with a few good hearty laughs. Desi Boyz's trailer leaves a very unsettled feeling. 
  
Maybe it's just because I pride myself in trying to give films that don't have very appealing trailers a fair shot. But I'd be lying if I said I can go in to watch Desi Boyz with any hopes. The story line is interesting in the sense that the pathos of the usual saga of a woman having to turn to selling herself in order to feed herself is turned around. Here you have male prostitution and no one seems to be taking anyone seriously. 
The only distant hope is that the comedy will - somehow, to some extent - work. But then again the director is from the Dhawan lineage, so... 
I know, I know, it's not fair to judge a son by his father's films, but when the name Rohit Dhawan stares back at you, it's difficult not to think of his father and his recent endeavors with comedy. The silver lining though is that Rohit Dhawan has been associated with Don and hopefully he has taken a few lessons in style from his experience there. 
The one good thing we know for sure is that we can look forward to seeing some good-looking people look very good - ladies and gentlemen, take your pick - Deepika Padukone, Chitrangadha Singh, John Abraham or Akshay Kumar. I know, I'm trying to hang by the last straw here. The music too isn't the kind I enjoy - too loud, too much of the same.
Oh well...is there any chance I'm in for a good surprise?

  Despite very low, if not nil or negative, expectations from Desi Boyz, I had this latent hope that the theme of "male escorts" will explore the sexual needs of women - a topic almost untouched in the Hindi film industry. Yes, yes, yes, I'm having a hearty laugh at myself for having this thought even in my subconscious. The joke on me is even bigger considering that the choice of Akshay Kumar should've killed any such hidden wishes. Anyway, that notwithstanding, I did enjoy the few hearty laughs that Desi Boyz gave me and I do concede that it manages to be the "no brains please" entertainer that it aims to be.

Yet, I cannot keep my heart from breaking at the complete disregard for story and the lousy attempt at having a conflict. There is no peak at which I wonder or care about what's going to happen to Nik (John Abraham) or Jerry (Akshay Kumar). They fight as easily as they make up, amongst themselves, or with their girlfriends. Events occur just because they "should" occur rather than flowing organically from one to another. 
Add to this an unnecessary love guru in the form of Anupam Kher with banal dialogue and scenes that have no connection to the film whatsoever. If the scenes between him and John Abraham were to show some kind of male-bonding, they seemed completely out-of-place. 
Given that, it is really interesting that though the scenes don't connect with each other, there are a few that work and make you laugh. Omi Vaidya and Bharti Achrekar have you in splits for the little time they are on screen. Their act gave the distinct feeling that a lot many more dialogues would've worked better had there been better performances, especially by John Abraham.
But hey, it is clear that John Abraham's job description for this film certainly does not include acting skills. He features in Desi Boyz purely for his worked-out-to-near-perfection body. Deepika Padukone and Chitrangadha Singh do look their usual beautiful selves. I'll do the mandatory by saying that there isn't anything other than looking gorgeous that they are required to do. So much for the women's lib theme, I had thought of. Yep, I'm still beating myself up for having let that thought cross my mind. 
They dance, they fool around. They make you laugh a little less than they ought to have given some wise cracks that are written for them. And sure, there are a lot many individual lines that could've worked, but the overall plot did nothing at all to engage. The characters are a rather bland variety of "good at heart, will grudgingly sell their souls for their loved ones".
Desi Boyz talks a bit about friendship, a bit about love, a bit about recession, a bit about doing what's needed to get what you want. And the attempt is to have fun while talking about all of this. But everything is superfluous and a plot that gets you involved is sorely missing.

abhishek4me:
          Who ever thought desi-boyz was either about desi or boys got it all wrong!! Its a so-so movie with cheesy lines and not funny scenes.
        
aashimad:
          Desi Boyz got better post interval. John ko acting nahin aati. Sach. DP ko bhi nahin aati. btw it has our 'Ek baar..commitment' dialog! :D

          And Desi Boyz is actually nothing more than Deepika & John's elevated boobs with Akshay's gay biceps.
        
tejasbaldev:
          I had these plans to write a review about how pathetic this desi boyz was/is, poker plans ruined It all.
        
tarpido:
          The only thing I'm doing in the second half of Desi boyz is fantasizing about Chitrangda Singh , nothing else makes sense.
        
sukhkarni:
          DESI BOYZ. Only two good things about the movie. Akshay Kumar sans his tomfoolery, and the hotness, called Chitrangda Singh!

RITUPARNOGHOSH:
          I dn't think mch abt the film. But his performance in Desi Boyz is subtle, mature and worthy of acclaim - he deserves a wider range of roles

          The only thing about Desi Boyz that is worse than the movie itself is the spelling of Boyz.

atulsahu369:
          Flop flick.. It failed to catch youths attention.. Thanks to Harvinder Singh.. :P RT @Nidhik20 Kisi ne desi boyz dekhi kya ?????
        
amlalani:
          Desi boyz is a movie made without any ethics. Ask a person really affected by recession how does it feel and s/he will tell u tht

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Two friends Nik (Akshay Kumar) and Jerry (John Abraham) lose their jobs due to recession and decide on becoming male escorts. This in turn, has it effects on their relationships with their families. All in a supposedly fun-fun way.Two friends Nik (Akshay Kumar) and Jerry (John Abraham) lose their jobs due to recession and decide on becoming male escorts.

The opening credits. Some of the shots in the montage brought a smile. Others were just nice to watch.
The songs were nice and peppy.
John Abraham looks awesome in the silhouette shots of him shirt-less. 
The out-takes during the end credits - such a welcome relief from having to watch a forced song video.

Radhika (Deepika Padukone) narrating details about the relationships, their history, chemistry, etc.
Do the men people living in the UK kiss their girlfriend-just-turned-fiancé on their forehead as soon as she says yes to his proposal for marriage? 
Sanjay Dutt's entry.
There's this scene where two friends are trying to make each other realize what they want to be. Such a lovely moment it could be. Totally shattered by awful acting.
Nik transforms too easily.
Akshay Kumar looks flabby in the silhouette shots of him shirt-less especially in comparison to John Abraham.
The excuses forced in for speaking in Hindi in an English environment
Akshay Kumar getting into jingoism mode a la Namastey London
Flirting with the judge!

Everyone looked sun-burnt. Make-up didn't cover it?
The coke/beer can that John Abraham opens to make the lid into a ring - he throws the can, but no drink falls off. 
The doggie gets left behind on the staircase when Nik is trying to woo Radhika.

Parental Guidance:


A huge chunk of the film is about how the protagonists have to become male escorts. 
Violence: None
Language: A few beeped out words
Nudity & Sexual content: A lot of hen parties with skimpily clad women. Nothing overtly sexual beyond the usual pole dancing that goes with party dances in Hindi films. 
Concept: Two men trying to earn enough to keep their loved ones with them.
General Look and Feel: Bright and peppy.
