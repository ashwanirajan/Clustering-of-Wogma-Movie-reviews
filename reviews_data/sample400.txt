A "war comedy" that doesn't engage or entertain. Instead preaches. War films - whether they are between countries or gangs - invariably end up touching on the futility of war.  War - Chhod Na Yaar wears it as a badge of honor. Even though, the route is different because they use satire and comedy, the theme is rubbed in way too hard. True, the solution to something like the India-Pakistan war can be as simple as 'stop fighting'. If only, it were that simple though, right? Given that War Chhod Na Yaar is satire and doesn't claim to take anything seriously, it might be a tad unfair to hold its simple solutions against it. Even so, the film misses basic coherence.Behind its satirical coat, War Chhod Na Yaar can get away with the implausibility of the plot. But then, the characters, situations, and dialogue were supposed to make you laugh or at least smirk, right? For example, the initial setup of an imminent war at the border, where our protagonists are stationed, doesn't move beyond until the film is well into the second half. To keep the situations comic you have typical potshots at Pakistanis. I would like to think that even for those who find it funny, the jokes would get old within five minutes of the film. Other than that there is toilet humor and other inane one-liners. And generic references to facebook and chat do not a cool movie make. Maybe, there is an odd line here or there that could make you laugh; other than that you are just waiting for something to happen. Sharman Joshi, Javed Jaffrey, and Sanjai Mishra do bring some energy to the film. However again, their characters get repetitive and thus predictable pretty soon. Soha Ali Khan is required to feel shy, flirt with her eyes and look determined every once in a while. She does that all right. Then you have your regular dose of songs that have no business being in the film. I guess we should just be thankful that there aren't any choreographed and/or item numbers. I am all for films that speak about the power of the common man. But, War Chhodo Na Yaar is more dissuading than empowering. It is highly unlikely that the makers didn't want to inspire the audience and make them feel like they can play a role. In that case, you can only think of it as an attempt that failed. Not to mention that an entire section of the population has been totally ignored. The section that does believe that the war should be fought. Maybe, that would be another film. Hopefully not.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.@Meetu:Please list and review few of your favorite classics from the 50's,60's and 70's!‘War Chhod Na Yaar‘ displays noble intentions, but lacks subtlety and insight. A clever idea used inefficiently and spent thoughtlessly. Avoidable!@Anuj Sholay, Chupke Chupke, Anand to name a few. I am assuming you are asking for Hindi films. Then, in a different genre, I've also liked New Delhi Times and Kalyug.@Meetu : What about Guru Dutt,Dev Anand,Raj Kapoor and Dilip Kumar classics?@Anuj I don't think of films in terms of the actors in them. It is the story for me. So, while I have liked films with these actors, they won't make it to my 'favorite' list.@Suraj :)Am I to assume u rate Chupke Chupke ahead of Naya Daur and Madhumati? Wow!! That's a first.@Anuj Oh, most certainly yes!Unusual as you always are :P  For me Anand and Chupke Chupke are just moderately watchable,nowhere near as good as the likes of Madhumati,Naya Daur,Mother India,Mughal E Azam etc. And yes Deewaar is definitely better than Sholay :P@Anuj we are two different people, aren't we? :DCopyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
