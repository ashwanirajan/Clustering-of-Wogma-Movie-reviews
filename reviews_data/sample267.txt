
wogma rating: Watch if you have nothing better to do (?)
An attempt at being imaginative at a regular love story gone too long and dry.After the lead pair, two crooks, brought in together in a police van for crimes they committed separately, predictably and lamely falls in love, Tamanchey is like any other love story with a couple that faces the wrath of their families for being in love. Only the family is replaced by the lady's boyfriend who happens to be a wrathful and powerful goon himself. For this group of criminals, you are allowed the liberty of fowl language, also making the film a little different from your regular family drama. But there is just no other element in the film to get you interested, let alone keep you there. It is kind of nice that a love story was made without any mush but that you don't even sense the chemistry between the couple is a let-down. This is despite lots and lots of screen time with each other and plenty more than one intimate scene between the two. The writing, in every aspect - dialogue, characterization, story arc - is completely lackluster. And that's where the crux lies. When pretty much the whole plot is predictable you can have only so much interest in how the actual ending goes. When the characters have a flat arch it matters little that they carry a shade of grey. When the focus is making the film overtly typical of how a real life criminal would talk, the superficiality and in-your-face nature of the dialogue shines through more than the lines itself. There is very little then that Richa Chadda and Nikhil Dwivedi can do with their performances. They have the right expressions but they all seem too mechanical. Either like they are under some kind of stress or like they don't have their heart in it. Just one of those cases where the hard work shows instead of seeming effortless. Given the "different" setting for the love story Tamanchey could have had a spark that could've made it at least a film watching once, if not a good film. That as you know by now, didn't quite work out.

        ...The film has many loopholes, and some parts are hard to digest. But Tamanchey still qualifies for a one time watch.  If you are expecting glamour of Bang Bang or class of Haider, then please plan something else for the week. But if you are a fan of crime capers, which are strange yet entertaining, then book the tickets for Tamanchey...

And to make it specific, the question here is not being asked in a positive tone at all....

        ...The film suffers in the editing department (Manish Jaitly) and so does the cinematography (Dani Sanchez Lopez). The film's screenplay (Shailesh Pratap Singh, Bharat Ratan) is very average, while action sequences (Kaushal & Moses) seem very stereotyped and bring nothing new to the table. 
All in all, TAMANCHEY is an average fare....

        ...Navneet Behal, the director, in this directionless story, makes a weak attempt to raise uneasy questions about a convict’s dilemma but he only manages to crowd the plot with too many things. Just a little over 100 minutes, Tamanchey feels eternal. And this reviewer cannot get over the Rang De Basanti-esque ending. To blatantly copy the treatment of such a vital scene from a cult film, makes this film, in my opinion, absolutely unforgivable....

        ...There’s a Punjabi rap number that plays out as an accompaniment to a series of bank heists pulled off by the illicit lovers, quite forgettable I must say. The script of the film doesn’t really know whether to go the double-crossing thriller route or the romantic-thriller route and therefore extends the runtime beyond bearable limits. There was ample scope for humour and thrills but the lack of foresight proves to be a debilitating factor here....

So what’s left? Yes, it is pretty much 2 hours of drudgery you should save yourself from. I am going with 1/5....

To her credit, Richa Chadda tries making sense of this senseless movie and even manages to look believable at points. Nikhil Dwivedi disappoints as he seems to walk through the role cluelessly, and he urgently needs some voice modulation classes. Damandeep Sidhu as the supposedly vicious but actually moronic villain, is not bad and, in fact, shows promise. ...

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Hmmmm...hope it will be a one time watch.Looking at your review and given the cre I wonder Why do people even bother making such films.But then we are back to the ROI discussions, and the phenomenal ROI that a low budget Yaariyan gave in 2013 explains it all.@Anirudh Well, maybe not.@Fan Then let's just avoid that. :D@Meetu ...Being a marwari how can you avoid ROI :)@Pragya ha ha ha.. that too a marwadi CA and MBA-Finance and Entreprenuership (not even Sales & Marketing!). I am what they call, will all intentional puns - khota sikka! :DDirection: 2    Story: 1    Lead Actors: 2.5    Character Artists: 1.5    Dialogues: 1.5    Screenplay: 1.5    Music Director: 0.2    Lyrics: 0.2Feel like the rating should have been Switch channel if its on cable....Not a single interesting scene , not a single laugh , not a single heart touching scene , not a single good song , infect not a single fine enough gun fight sequence.....Richa Chadda is highly wasted.....This movie should not have been even made.....@Anup well ...give or take. not an enjoyable film, is the point.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
