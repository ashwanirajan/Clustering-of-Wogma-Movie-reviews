Luv Shuv Tey Chicken Khurana gives you exactly what is promised in the trailers. A warm Punjabi family, subtle humor, a little romance, a little suspense, and a predictable base plot. Fine performances and some fresh, earthy dialogue keep the momentum and interest in this otherwise plain plot.  The thick Punjabi flavor of Luv Shuv tey Chicken Khurana instantly associates it with films like Khosla ka Ghosla and Vicky Donor. And lo and behold it is brought to us by the people who brought Khosla Ka Ghosla. Other than the name Khurana, the brash yet charming unabashed nature of the characters assures you of some perfectly timed one-liners. By that association, it feels like a film where you'd spot Abhay Deol or Ayushmann Khurana but it is a pleasant surprise to see Kunal Kapoor here. Hopefully he does justice to the lawyer he plays who is now trying to revive an ancestral restaurant which is dependent on figuring out the recipe of a chicken curry. All this while wooing a doctor who is played by Huma Qureshi, last seen in Gangs of Wasseypur. And there comes the Anurag Kashyap connection again, who is also Luv Shuv Tey Chicken Khurana's producer.That immediately brings in shudders induced by Aiyyaa which is the last film produced by Anurag Kashyap Films Pvt Ltd.  And all I can do is cross my fingers hoping that that is not what this one will turn out to be. Yet, Luv Shuv Tey Chicken Khurana looks like an enjoyable film. The ambiance created seems to be perfect dialogue, characters, music all fit in perfectly. Here's hoping that it won't be the run-of-the-mill Punjabi loudness we are served with but it has a special touch that will be remembered beyond those two hours in the theater. Music Reviews:
Milliblog - "Amit seems oddly out of his comfort zone here!"
Music Aloud - "8/10"
dunkdaft - "Amit Trivedi...The guy, is unstoppable with his innovations. Just imagine how he recently gave Marathi and Southern spice* and now here he is with Punjabi tadka. And another highlight of this album is lyricist Shellee. Its a fultoo fun ride just because of his words. "
Bollywood Hungama - "2/5"
Bollyspice - "2.5/5"
Happy Sing - "Amit Trivedi is here. Not throughout in his regular colors, but the colors he is wearing are almost all nice. Better than some of his recent works."

  From the earth of Punjab come people who are charmingly simple because they are open-hearted and uninhibited. We know this because of the unrepressed dialogue given to these Punjabis. Punjabis who for a change don't shout and are not dressed in loud silks. Yet, you cannot escape the lack of depth in the basic plot. I guess you can't get it all. You know the protagonist Omi (Kunal Kapoor) is going to end up looking for a secret ingredient in his grandfather's recipe. After seeing the trailers, the main reasons that bring you to the theater are - to find out not what happens but how it happens and to see that 10% deviation from your prediction of what it is going to be. You can't but resist the hope that at least something will be different because of the name Anurag Kashyap associated with it, right?Unfortunately, you wait and wait for it to happen, but it doesn't come. That small twist or that extra conflict over what has been exposed in the trailer or that 'ah-ha' moment that the film is nicely and lovingly building up towards - but it just doesn't come. It teases you every once in a while with the protagonist, Omi (Kunal Kapoor) considering to behave according to what his character is made out to be, but ultimately, you are only teased. And as with many, many films, the end is a little contrived and convenient.Fortunately though, warm performances by every member of the cast, the dialogue they are given, Amit Trivedi's music and the rugged, dusty ambiance created are the four strong pillars that Luv Shuv Tey Chicken Khurana stands on. The chemistry between various combinations of characters is charming and the brewing romance has its own flavor of cute. From the twinkle in grandpa's eyes when he first sees Omi after 10 years to the tune the title music breaks into halfway to the dust on the walls of the houses to a lot of things in between - everything works in adding value to the experience of watching a story.However, a predictable basic plot is a predictable basic plot and can only provide only so much of a firm foundation however strong the pillars. This once, my belief that if the how you get to the end of a story is done well, the what you find there doesn't matter as much has been proven slightly wrong. For whatever Luv Shuv Tey Chicken Khurana has achieved is because of the "how"s going right. If only, a little of this "how" was also about some meat in the story part of the writing. Also, ever since the missing ingredient is revealed, I had this nagging feeling of having seen this before or read it somewhere. An internet search hasn't brought much to light except that the concept of a missing ingredient/recipe has been looked for umpteen number of times, which we always knew. But the sense of 'tune that haunts you because you can't think of the words' just won't leave me. Hopefully, it'll come soon.

        ...It’s hard not to leave Luv Shuv Tey Chicken Khurana wondering whether the director, Sameer Sharma, saw Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge as a child, and, unimpressed, vowed that he would one day show the Bollywood establishment how a Punjab-based romance should really be made. And in the process, he’s made the quintessential anti-Bollywood movie, hitting the same notes as a family-friendly crowd-pleaser but underplaying each one....

            So-So,
            by Mudit
: Undercooked...or it's probably because I'm a Vegetarian!
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.I personally felt this film is trying too hard to bank on the 'Punjabi' flavour, so well established by Khosla Ka Ghosla & Vicky Donor among others. Also, the plotline seems too wafer-thin - wonder how will they carry an entire film on its premise.@Harsh I am looking forward to the one-line plot actually. I love it when films pull that off successfully. Let's see how it works out :DI am quite a fan of the soundtrack, though :) what an year Trivedi has had!Now, THAT is true. This year was a lot of variety from him. Though I liked music from last year better.Meeta...remember Kung fu Panda for the missing ingredient? Anyway, even I felt LSTCK was undercooked!!@Mudit that's one! but the one I am (still) trying to remember, is about an actual recipe and the missing ingredient is something very close to what this one has.Hadn't seen a single poster or trailer before signing up for this one. At best disappointed. Too slow and lacks the punch.@Annkur uh-oh!Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
