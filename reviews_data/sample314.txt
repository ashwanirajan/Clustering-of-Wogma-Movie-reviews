This stuff happens in real life. Uhh...only that real life has a little less background music and the dialogue is not over-written, and maybe the performances are less melodramatic. You roll your eyes as you realise Heropanti is yet another "love of my life" vs. "parental consent" film. As the parents (read extended family) get more and more vicious your heart sinks because another realisation hits you - this happens in real life, even now. Unfortunately, for Heropanti, real life and decades of films on the topic had desensitized the audience to these issues in the 90s.  With nothing new to say and a hero who wears pink lipstick to the rescue, Heropanti becomes a 2.5 hour long, predictable drone. I think opening titles are an artform by themselves. Besides the creativity that goes into making them, they set the tone of a film. So, it was a huge turn-off when Heropanti had just the two lead actors' and director's names in the opening title. Not because it was short, but doesn't it show conceit? To me, that decision says how little the other team members mattered in the making of the film. I guess a bell should ring when you hear the name Tiger Shroff in a film called, "Hero"panti and the popular tune from Subhash Ghai's film that shot Jackie Shroff (Tiger Shroff's father, for the uninitiated) to Hero status in the early 80s. Such tactics tell you upfront how strong the makers' confidence on the product itself is. Fair enough, they have tried to inject Hero-ness into Tiger Shroff by giving him some so-bad-that-they-are-good lines - which he delivers with as much style as is possible to make them look more fake and forced than they already are. Then of course, they are repeated so that we can tell that a scene is setup so that the line could be repeated.  Surrounded by such superficiality then, it is a miracle, that for a short while you get involved in the drama. You worry that the hero is in a tight spot and that he might get face brutal violence that you don't have the stomach for. That has to be because of the aura created around the villains. Uncharacteristically for the film, Prakash Raj's character, Chaudhary is grey enough to keep you interested. Of course, Prakash Raj, is relatively restrained and has you both worried for the hero and yet, you see yourself sympathizing with him, even if briefly. Unfortunately but not surprisingly, the writers do not capitalize on the emotion that this character evokes. As is expected, the women are pretty tools for the hero and the villain to fight over. Her love for the hero is taken for granted. Her father emotionally blackmails her into believing that she is his property and so on. But then again, that's what women in such situations face in real life. Also, in real life, starlets get a chance to play an action hero with various shades of pink on as lipstick. No, I cannot get over it. At the risk of sounding sexist for wanting to deprive men of cosmetics, such on-the-face make-up is unacceptable even for women. And you cannot escape the distraction for a minute because Tiger Shroff is in almost every scene (after his entry). Not that one was expecting great shakes from a film called Heropanti. But, that the makers, with a 100% fresh starcast don't even attempt to break any mould is disheartening. In fact, they try to milk the popularity of a 20-year old film. Just sad.

        ...On the whole, HEROPANTI is designed as a launch pad for Tiger Shroff and it gives him ample opportunity to prove his credentials in his debut film. The good news is, he delivers a striking performance. Additionally, what works is the masala quotient -- melodrama, music and action. An entertainer that hits the right notes! ...

There is no reason for you to expect anything more than a masala film with a predictable story line, nor should you expect to come out awed by the young boy (as you were by the father), but it is worth a watch. Just another commercial movie with plenty of high speed action sequences, Heropanti may not be an eternal love story, but there is hope yet, for both the actors....

Kiransammy:
          Heropanti kabhi meri jati nahi.

Very nice movie bt only 1 tym watch movie...
        
GaziMumbai:
          #Heropanti is average .. #KritiSanon is good .. #PrakashRaj is very good .. #TigerShroff is excellent.
        
fara_s:
          Watched #heropanti coz of whistle Baja and tabah... Must say movie wasn't bad.. One time watch...  Stunts and dancing pretty impressive...
        
cinema_babu:
          #Heropanti is a timepass flick. Tiger Shroff lacks in expressions but dances and fights well. #PrakashRaj's role is highlight of the movie.
        
ashveersingh06:
          Heropanti serves as a reminder that not all star sons can act. I wanted action, all I got was predictable drama @RazeenGutta @ronesh 6/10
        
ashishsaksena:
          #Heropanti is an 80's film & definitely not perfect.Fast paced & entertaining. #TigerShroff has it all to be a star. Super music. Watchable.
        
anirudhbb:
          Heropanti worked for me as it was very fresh in terms of casting, story left much desired but definitely give it a shot! Watch! #fb
        
12345ankitgoyal:
          good to watch once but not a superhit http://toi.in/micron/redirect.html?str=e8QXUZ

yaseengani786:
          If not for that tigers awkward pink lipstick #Heropanti  sure could have been a more comfortable watch !!
        
vishal_1505:
          Heropanti is total chutyapanti
        
vatsalvirus:
          Difference between Hero (1983) and Heropanti (2014) is that heropanti is full of crap shit.
        
Swamii_says:
          "@Mumbai_Chokari: #Heropanti  should have been named as #Chutiyapanti"

#LOL
        
Shutiyapa:
          Heropanti.. Mare ko to ye chutiyapanti lgi. Save tiger pls
        
shashwatluthra:
          #heropanti: tiger shroff paida karega hindi movies ka khauff. sheer stupidity
        
rudeopinion:
          #Heropanti was great. Esp. the part where I fell asleep & it was over.
        
Parag_Jalan:
          Heropanti dekhne ke baad esa lga ki tiger ko acting ka A bhi nai aata. Hahah what a review. Class.
        
Nautanki_Hero:
          #Heropanti näi hai võ #Chutyapanti hai .  :) The old style of #bollywood movies is back.. :)
        
MailSurajit:
          Watched 'Heropanti' today. Tiger Shroff has failed to impress. I don't know whether India lacks good script writers or not.
        
lahodywapum:
          How dumb can one get? You have to watch Heropanti to understand. Why Tiger, why?!
        
kirit_pr:
          #Heropanti a BIG NO..!
        
Kiran1545218:

          After watch #Heropanti just one word bakwas 3rd class ek salman kam tha jo dusra agaya bad script. 1 out of 5 star.

coldblood04:
          Heropanti is all about chutiyapanti 2stars
        
BeingShimSid:
          How many different love stories would Bollywood make #Heropanti  good entertainer, what I like the most is Hero,s title BABLOO :D
        
AnshuBindaas:
          Watched #Heropanti

Don't ask. Let me forget about it. #nightmare

          #Heropanti # Review : Horrible Script, Horrible Direction, Bad Acting by Tiger.
K. Sanon does well.
Sabbir Khan fails misrebily.
*1/2
        No readers have rated this movie yet.This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Is Tiger Shroff Jackie Shroff's son or grandson? As for the movie? Yeah, even I'm getting a "Nineties Movie" feel off of this - and I'm an American who only started seriously watching Indian Cinema a few years ago!@TimTiger is Jackie's son.Another excellent review from meetu. Hero wearing pink lipstick to the rescue- LOLZZZZZ@TimELiebe Yes, it has a heavy, lingering taste of the 90s@Fan Thanks for answering :D@wogmafan thanks :D@Fan - thanks for answering! :) I see from Wikipedia Jackie Shroff didn't get married until the late Eighties, so I guess it figures that his kid would only be in his Twenties now. @Meetu - so they've got a movie starring the son of a major star who's never had to carry a movie before, and a female lead who's even less experienced? ::makes WAYNE'S WORLD smirky-face:: Should Be Excellent! ::snorts laughter through my nose!::If that's not all wire-fu in the trailer's fight scenes, then maybe Tiger Shroff has a future as an action star - but as a romantic hero? I think I'd believe Sonny Deol as one first….@TimELiebe ha ha ha..wire-fu! :DCopyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.

Language: Clean
Nudity & Sexual content: A couple of lip-to-lip kisses. Not long.
Concept: Parent's wishes versus love of your life.
General Look and Feel: Attempt at lively through loud.
