New faces, but no value addition to the film, no new story.He can punch and kick, he can pump iron of course, he can dance, he can maybe even romance. Whether or not Sooraj Pancholi can act though we will have to wait for another film to know. She is tall, she has flawless skin, she can pout. Whether or not Athiya Shetty can act though we will have to wait for another film to know. The good news though is that they aren't complete write-offs. Though it is suspicious that there are times when slow motion seemed to aid his swag and her pout even. But, you never know how things might turn out a couple of films later a la Alia Bhatt. Also, they barely have a chance at dialogue delivery in this film, given they have hardly  more than a line at a time to deliver. Almost as if the director knew that they wouldn't be able to handle it. Why a director with reasonable aptitude like Nikhil Advani agreed to make a film that is more or less a show reel for the starlings - whose parents weren't the greatest actors or even stars themselves – is beyond me. Whatever the reason might have been, that the dialogue was held at bare minimum gave a few “moment”s to the film. Though not sizzling, at times, there is a lingering charm about Sooraj Pancholi and Athiya Shetty's chemistry. Which is also why we can maybe hold judgment about them as actors for a couple more films. They aren't completely plastic as we have come to expect from new actors. Yet, they aren't natural. Through the film you think of them more in terms of whose kids they are in real life rather than the characters they play.The characters themselves barely have any facets or depth to them. Neither do any of the other aspects of writing. The story stays more or less like Hero (1983). Hero kidnaps heroine for whatever reason. Because they are hero and heroine they have to fall in love. How they drive overnight from Mumbai to a place where it snows is not a question we ask. Anyway, families don't like the alliance. Yadi-yada-da. We saw that 32 years ago and some versions of it before that and after. Sure, the lighting, the framing, the editing (especially that of the laser dance) is slick. But, the finale performance or even the fight sequence is lame again. It is striking that patronizing patriarchy has lived through the years. It was back then and it seems to be the norm – at least in many of our movies – even now. It is unnerving that the sole reason for the lead lady's existence in the film is so that she can be protected. It gives the men in her life something to do. Didn't make sense then, doesn't make sense now. Only now she is empowered enough to give away her shorts and mini skirts in an exchange offer for salwar suits to show that she is mourning. Oh well. Life goes on. The same movie still gets made. New faces, but no value addition to the film, no new stories. So used to expecting the same thing over and over again have we gotten, that we have even stopped getting bored watching them. You shrug, “what else did you expect” and move on.

        ...But then, every time you see the lead hero live up to the demands of his film and role you forgive all the mistakes. By the end, in classic Salman Khan style action, the shirts come off and the six packs and bulging biceps take control. And like a devoted Bhai fan will tell you, when that happens the film becomes paisa vasool. While there's nothing new on offer in terms of story, the fresh new faces and a brisk runtime of 131 minutes make Hero a breezy entertainer.

And while you are well acquainted with the story, Nikhil and Salman's sensibility works as midas touch, giving the film a different texture. It is slick and never allows its viewers to feel restless. For its 132 minutes' crisp runtime, Hero offers bucketful of entertainment and victoriously conveys that commercial movies needn't be puerile to show people a good time.

        ...What’s not:

The problem lies with the script. It just isn’t innovative or fresh enough. Advani plays safe and doesn’t offer anything new. The story sort of reaches a stale mate in the second half. The introduction of Vivan Bhatena as the baddie seems like an added distraction to shift focus from the lack of a cohesive plot. Also Athiya’s costumes and make up looks sketchy, especially the close ups. There are some badly edited scenes. Sooraj and Athiya fall in a downstream river that oddly takes them up north where Athiya offers prayers to ‘Buddha ji’ promising him she will abscond from all things bad. Only if she had made a similar promise after reading the shoddy script. Except the title song, nothing stands out. In fact the Romeo Juliet skit act in the second half just tests our patience wearing us out. Sooraj has a fantastic body, but every time he rips his shirt to shred, we don’t need a minute long tribute to his naked torso.

What to do:
Sooraj and Athiya show immense promise. Unfortunately, Hero doesn’t do justice to their potential.

        ...The story is old hat and quite ancient to boot. So when presented with modern, stylised trappings and without the passion and melody of yore, it just falls flat. As a debut vehicle for star children, this one is a swank, glossy one. But on an intellectual level there’s nothing credible going on. So largely, looks and facetious action is all we have to go on. The characters appear like card-board cut-outs and their perceived motivations lack gravity. The presentation of the two young wannabe stars is quite redolent. Tushar Kanti Ray’s  camerawork does wonders for both the young stars and even makes the milieu and the set-up look fantastic.

It’s time directors stopped getting well-built male stars to rip off their own shirts or have their clothes blown away by the wind in the middle of a climactic fight to flaunt their ripped torsos – for god’s sake, that worked in Dabangg because Salman’s confrontation with Sonu Sood was executed in a part-serious-part-comic tone. It’s time they stopped getting comedians to speak in rhymes. In Hero, a gori woman tells her obese lover: “You are my Mr Right, but I want your body tight.”

Given that he's Salman Khan's protégé, it's no surprise that Sooraj, who we’re first introduced to in an impressive training montage, knows his way around action, and looks good without his shirt…which happens often in this film. Athiya, required to be shrill and bimbo-like in the film's initial scenes, appears confident and natural, even if a little raw. There's clearly potential in the pair to do bigger, better things. In one of the film's few genuinely moving moments, they display an aching vulnerability while simply looking at each other from afar, their eyes brimming with tears, no words uttered. Hero just about scratches the surface.

Sooraj is slightly better but doesn’t give the impression of a brooding, angry young man who can single-handedly change things for Pasha. At the most Sooraj comes across as the boy who is irked because his father has not been able to bring the promised gizmos. There is more to acting than doing a head stand on nails. Right now his tattoos speak more than his face but some day with the right script he might shine. For now he is just a pale shadow of his godfather Salman Khan.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Father and mother were so-so actors.  Wonder if the son could surpass them?  I have my doubts, but who knows.Father was a so-so actor.  Wonder if the daughter could surpass him.  I have my doubts, but who knows.Hero - 2015A guy convicted for manslaughter is actively promoting a guy charged with abeitting suicide.What depths has our society fallen to?Villain - 2015 would be a more appropriate title.I wanted this movie to be a flop..In this era where newcomers are taking so much risk , also providing unique movies in their debuts , to debut in a remake of a movie released 32 years before and which again was not hit for a great plot but because of Subhash Ghai and Laxmikant Pyarelal , it was a bad idea (atleast HEROPANTI was a south indian remake that aslo not too old).Although i have a soft corner for Nikhil Advani for delivering Kal Ho Na Ho and D Day and m also waiting for some quirky ness in KATTI BATTI.. But this one m not gonna give a try.. From the first trailer everything looks boring even the emotions of the lead cast. But Actually  all the reviewers habe said that the movie was atleast bearable because to the performance of starcast which is shocking to me. Cant comment without seeing it on my Lappy.. This one is a skip for me..Totally avoidable film.Do yourself a favour: if you want to watch Hero then watch the 80s version made by Shubhash Ghai.  It is also not a great film but miles better than the 2015 version.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
