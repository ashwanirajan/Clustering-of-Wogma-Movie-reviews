Gen X - it takes everything in stride - pre-marital pregnancies, sexual orientation, double-timing - everything is cool. A group of friends excels in the leg-pulling game and has fun like you and I do. If only, they didn’t end up in a tiring climax that doesn't have a superlative or expletive to describe it. Quick quips are shot down by aimless sub-plots, songs and did I mention, awful climax."Boy meets girl. On the phone. Boy lies about stuff. Love happens. Time to tell truth, now what?" That's almost your every other love story. Sure, it might not be the very premise of the plot like it is in Jhootha Hi Sahi, but the theme makes its way into a part of a love story, more often than I'd like. Mainly because it's cliché and given the genre we generally know how it's going to end. And the worst part is that there is barely anything one can do to make the inevitable "forgiving of all lies ever said" look fresh.
Top it off with director, Abbas Tyrewala's blatant choice for spoof for his earlier venture, Jaane tu yaa jaane na. Sure it had set the premise well in the first 5 minutes of the film, yet, I cringe at the thought of a writer of his stature directing a typical scene to close the film. I cringed then too. 
He's a witty, intelligent man, and it hurts to see him do things that he thinks that the "masses" would enjoy and bring his buck. Sample  his interpretation of the title of the film in one of his tweets  -
 Jhootha Hi Sahi means "Even Though He's A Liar", but also "The Liar Is The Right One" 
Isn't the second one nice? 
But, a glance at John Abraham's nerdy look reminds you of the stereotypes you have to look forward to. Now put that in combination with "mass-appealing" things like, a smart-looking girlfriend (min 0.19 in trailer below). What's my problem with a smart girlfriend? Point me to a geek in real life with a girlfriend, let alone a smart one! But we are talking about John Abraham, after all. At least he has supposedly gone to great extents to get a paunch  to blend in with the typecast -
when I was told that I had to shave, wear glasses and not go to the gym, I told my director Abbas I'm really worried because people know me for my physicality, which is fair enough. But after now seeing the film I gave Abbas a hug and said 'Thank you for not letting me go the gym 
Also, I'm sure his look reminds us all of Uday Chopra in Pyaar Impossible. I doubt anyone would call that a good beginning. At least, John Abrahamdoesn't have Uday Chopra's silly smile in the name of an expression. 
Speaking of expression, supposedly John Abraham has learnt a few new tricks . ahem -
 Abbas Tyrewala taught me how to speak a lie, and now I won't be a pathetic liar anymore 
Actually, the trailer gives us glimpses too. He does have some voice variation going here (min: 1.35). Also, there's body movement (min: 0.48), so we can't complain about absence of body language. 

Ok-ok. Apologies. What do I do, it's just so tempting to take pot-shots at his non-acting. I love John Abraham's recent choice of films. He's been very bold and some of them might actually have never been made, if it were not for him. And I'm actually looking forward to Jhootha hi Sahi because it might just be one of those 'different' films he's known to take up. Also he reassures us that 'Jhootha Hi Sahi' has turned out to be 100 times better than the promo. And that he's confident wouldn't have to eat his words. 
There is another aspect that adds to my curiosity. Pakhi, the script-writer, plays the female protagonist. The writer playing a major role is a new one, no (barring the times when the writer is the director and actor in the film)? AND she is also the director's wife. This is how they handled the complications such a fatal combination can bring -
Both Pakhi and I decided that once the script was locked, we won’t let the film come between our relationship. Pakhi went into a different mode and was extremely professional. Even while we were shooting in London, for three months, we got separate rooms and decided not to have a personal life at all. 
I just hope the lady wasn't responsible for the awful text superimposes in the trailer "Nothing lies like true love", "A not so simple love story". On the other hand, I loved the text image on Jhootha hi Sahi's facebook wall. 
Such little things associated with Jhootha Hi Sahi, make the ever-hopeful-me cross my fingers for an enjoyable. It does have scope to be a good relationship drama. 
Anyway, the beginning is not too exciting. Whatever little music I heard from the film isn't quite impressive. The music reviews on the web are sort-of lukewarm too.
milliblog - As if making up for Endhiran’s bombastic outburst, Rahman delivers and succeeds with a gorgeous experiment, quite confidently! 
music aloud - Simplicity and subtlety win you over
HappySing - The music is good and while I was expecting the lyrics to go really down after cry cry, they aren’t that bad either
Apun ka choice - The music is slow, and beats are ear-friendly. 
IANS - keeps the listeners' interest intact. 
Bollywood Hungama - starts on a jerky note and actually takes some time to settle down
Rediff - Rahman isn't the god I used to worship but he certainly has a lot more up his sleeve. 
Bollyspice - Rahman is a master at his craft, and with each new album he impresses you all the more. 
buzzintown - vintage Rahman

  A friend is a friend is a friend. He has moral support, come what may. To that extent, Jhootha Hi Sahi is true-to-life and very enjoyable. Like any other group of friends, each one in this bunch has below-the-belt insults in store for each other and yet they'll watch out for each other in the most ridiculous situations. This initial set-up is hilarious and mucho fun. But, set that aside and almost everything is superficial, improbable, and many-a-time outright stupid. Even if you ignore everything else that's wrong with Jhootha Hi Sahi, the songs (every, single thing about them) and the climax , unfortunately are turn-offs HUGE enough to make you dislike the whole film.

The crisp dialogue, its delivery, the slapstick and its timing is simply brilliant as the film starts. Yes, I laughed out loud at the most typical slapstick. And I have only the director to thank for that because brilliant actors have brought an eye roll with predictable slapstick. Of course, the actors did their bit here too. Else, who would've thought John Abraham would make me laugh with him?  But that happens only when he is not preaching philosophy or flitting like a butterfly (I shall NOT elaborate). 
Anyhow, every once in a while, he and a few of the others have "quote of the day" type lines which deserve and got a cringe and a few more. 
The others actors did well only because of the banter-type lines that go between friends. But, Anaitha Nair and Alishka Varde fit in perfectly as the kind of girl-friends I'd like to have, spirited and always bring a smile! 
Pakhi on the other hand, doesn't necessarily ooze charm. But it's just refreshing to have a non-glam, non-wannabe-size-zero as the female lead. She has to play a character she has written, Mishka. While I don't know whether that made it easy or difficult for her, I appreciated that Mishka grew as a woman and wasn't defined only by the men in her life. Also thematically, it was a delight to see an inclusive attitude towards the homosexual community. Not only were there non-trivial gay characters, Mishka is also shown going "aaawwww" for a fleeting moment in a song when she sees a lesbian couple. Heartening beyond measure. 
Besides that and other close-to-life, normal characters, the script ranged from random sub-plots to uninhibitedly absurd. There are characters and they have stories, but their motivations are unknown and their actions unjustified. There's the girlfriend who doesn't seem to care but is supposedly in love and there's the friend who doesn't want to marry the guy she's in love with. When nothing comes of these sub-plots, they look like mere props in the grander scheme of things. 
In fact, that is partly true of the main character, Siddharth, as well. The film makes you wonder whether he or his friend, Omar know when (let alone why) he falls in or out of love? Then again, maybe that's cool too, because that is a mere reflection of the confused 'gen x'?

Pakhi on the other hand, doesn't necessarily ooze charm. But it's just refreshing to have a non-glam, non-wannabe-size-zero as the female lead. She has to play a character she has written, Mishka. While I don't know whether that made it easy or difficult for her, I appreciated that Mishka grew as a woman and wasn't defined only by the men in her life. Also thematically, it was a delight to see an inclusive attitude towards the homosexual community. Not only were there non-trivial gay characters, Mishka is also shown going "aaawwww" for a fleeting moment in a song when she sees a lesbian couple. Heartening beyond measure. 
Besides that and other close-to-life, normal characters, the script ranged from random sub-plots to uninhibitedly absurd. There are characters and they have stories, but their motivations are unknown and their actions unjustified. There's the girlfriend who doesn't seem to care but is supposedly in love and there's the friend who doesn't want to marry the guy she's in love with. When nothing comes of these sub-plots, they look like mere props in the grander scheme of things. 
In fact, that is partly true of the main character, Siddharth, as well. The film makes you wonder whether he or his friend, Omar know when (let alone why) he falls in or out of love? Then again, maybe that's cool too, because that is a mere reflection of the confused 'gen x'?

          It's disappointing to read the reviews on jhootha hi sahi. Looks like the intellectual critics could not understand a few simple facts.

yashrocks09:
          I think overdose of humor, some character sketches not upto the mark and the dullness in the screenplay works against Jhootha hi Sahi.

          Pakhi, the lead actress of Jhootha Hi Sahi should do herself a favour & NOT act ever  again.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Boy meets girl. On the phone. Boy lies about stuff. Love happens. Time to tell truth, now what?Boy meets girl. On the phone. Boy lies about stuff. Love happens. Time to tell truth, now what?
The subtle national (international?) integration thing on the dinner table. A Muslim calling grace and a Hindu obeying.
The sequence in the video store.
The pink cab!
Siddharth flying like Superman.

Pakhi looked older, much older than John Abraham.
Extra weightage to Kabir's sub-plot. If he had to stay that long, he should've come earlier on.
Don’t any of these people have any work to do? How do they pay rents and gas bills?
John Abraham flitting like a butterfly at the end of the 'cry cry' song.
@alisha @rishabh yeah regular reviewers have been a little too harsh, it was just about alright.i think it's nice.@ayaz thank you ji!@Andy thanks! i might have liked JHS slightly better than RC1, but not that much better. JHS - loved the beginning, hated the last half hour or so. RC1 - was indifferent/bored in the movie except for the last half hour. Overall feeling while leaving the theater was "'Even the keen, wait for DVD".@surjya thank you.@Paras i think the last 15 mins completely killed the movie. it was not at all in the same tone.@Srini i know people who hated the film because of the casual take on suicide attempts and the last 15-20 mins. oh well...to each his own :DCopyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
