A must miss. Sloppy visual effects, lamest lines of all, a bizarre plot which wishes that I empathize with an anti-hero who threatens to blast trains don't make a couple of good chase sequences worth it. And you meet some of the most unplanned terrorists on the way. The trailer of Tezz seems to suggest that the protagonist actually plants a bomb in a train in England - and that is Ajay Devgan. That is a HUGE gray character to set up right in the promo material. But, unfortunately other than that everything else in the promo material made me smirk at the film, especially the lines given to Anil Kapoor and Boman Irani. 

For example, the four 'making of...' videos provide great entertainment if you can laugh AT inanities the people involved in the film can say about the film they have worked on - From Kangna Ranaut in awe of the 'nice places' the producers took them out to eat at; not to mention her weird accent in which she calls Anil Kapoor "shiverous?"; to Ajay Devgan calling Anil Kapoor boring. And did Sameera Reddy just call Priyadarshan, Quentin here? And yet Sameera comes across as the most sensible of them all. The point being, if this is the best the film's team has to say about the film in the promotional material, I only dread what the entire film will be like. 
Then there is the whole title song/theme music/background score based on misirlou which beyond the basic tune doesn't do anything imaginative. And this is coming from a person who loves listening to any misirlou tune. It might also have to do with the fact that the last I remember the tune used in a Hindi film was in Cash and coincidentally it the cast had Ajay Devgan and Zayed Khan too. And Cash is in my all-time 'worst films' list. 
In addition, philosophically, the trailers raise red flags for me. Whenever racism and associate terrorism is talked about in films, I get a little tense about the author's perspective on the subject. Not only does the protagonist here advertise himself as 'not a terrorist' but also there is a direct reference to 'racial profiling'. 
The main trailer with the visuals in this song give pretty much the entire plot. And even though nothing much seems to be exciting about Tezz, the question that remains is interesting enough for me to be mildly interested in how Tezz ends - how are they going to justify the main lead setting up a bomb in a train?

  Tezz makes your brain go numb - with loud action sequences that accompany shoddy VFX, with its inane dialogue, with content that is mind-bogglingly dim-witted. An illegal immigrant gets so offended for being thrown out of UK that he comes back to threaten, takes along other illegal immigrants  to blow a couple of trains off and make demands of the government!? And the hope is that the his backstory is going to make the audience see the justification behind the actions of this "anti-hero"?! 





(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});


Even if a part of the audience, like me, thinks of Aakash Rana (Ajay Devgan) more as a villain than an anti-hero, he's not loathsome enough to make Tezz watchable. And it is a huge disappointment in that villains who aren't absolutely nasty have such potential to make interesting characters. But here, Aakash seems as misguided as the writers, assuming there were writers involved in this project.
Yep! Beginning to complain about the plot holes implies that there was a coherent plot. All I know is, if I start filling in the 'didn't work' section of the notepad in the opening sequence of a film, the next two hours are pretty much written off. While the film is more or less one chase sequence after the other - some of them well-choreographed, others interrupted by childish graphics and special effects - you wish text on screen said 'The End' when it reads 'Interval'. 
None of the main characters have roles that require too much emoting or even speaking - the latter is a good thing. Especially, when the potential speakers are the likes of Kangna Ranaut who made me cringe at her diction even for the two lines that she had. Actually both, she and Sameera Reddy, can barely be called "lead" characters. Of the lot, in fact Boman Irani followed by Anil Kapoor get some screen space that allows for at least some expressions. But, then they have such awful lines, that you wish they hadn't taken this film in the first place. 
Then you have the songs that are as out of place even if someone somewhere tried to justify it with some convoluted reason. Mallika Sherawat's 'laila' must be one of the worst choreographed and picturised item numbers of recent times. 
Tezz gives a weird sense of disappointment - the kind that you get even when you weren't expecting anything half-decent to begin with.

: Shady plot and grey characters built around too many and too long chase sequences..
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.An illegal immigrant gets so offended for being thrown out of UK that he comes back to threaten, takes along other illegal immigrants  to blow a couple of trains off and make demands of the government.An illegal immigrant gets so offended for being thrown out of UK that he comes back to threaten, takes along other illegal immigrants  to blow a couple of trains off and make demands of the government.
That there was a decent proportion of non-Indians in UK. And that they spoke in English. That they were bad actors is an entirely different issue. 

The court in UK looked more like the ones in India, no?
Aakash Rana (Ajay Devgan) sitting alone in the court after being implicated.
The random slow-motion shots, for example the one where the coin falls off the beggar's bowl.
A person deported from UK for being an illegal immigrant is allowed to come back or finds his way back! Really?
Some action sequences were hilarious - one in particular had Aakash and Aadil (Zayed Khan) wait to face the cops when the place they were at is raided and then Aakash shouts at Aadil to 'run!'
So, the cops in UK get hold of an arms dealer, take him to a train station and then handcuff him after he gets off the car?
Why is a arms dealer who is caught in London being taken to Glasgow, anyway?
These wannabe terrorists handover open bombs from one to another!
Mohanlal.
The animation in the train switch.
and many many more such things...
@Anuj :( sad but true@Anoop is it? Haven't seen it.Why did you even watch this movie :P@Nicko :) So am i being charged for not liking Tezz? @Aditya Professional hazards :)@Preeth :)I haven't read any other reviews by 'meetu' butI certainly will.

Parental Guidance:


Violence: Loads and loads and loads of gun fights.
Language: A couple of abuses.
Nudity & Sexual content: A skimpily clad Mallika Sherawat in an item number.
Concept: That of justifying the anger of illegal immigrants in the UK.
General Look and Feel: An attempt at being slick.
