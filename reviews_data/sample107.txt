
wogma rating: Watch if you have nothing better to do (?)
A preachy school play that could have meant more. A film that will get “well-intended, heart in the right place” nominations. A Flying Jatt takes the good vs. evil theme a bit too seriously. Sure, you can't expect anything less from a superhero film. But, A Flying Jatt takes every opportunity it gets to hammer a message down. I don't know what is worse – that it does so, or that it does so after avoiding it for the first half. The first half treats the audience with some respect, allowing them to figure at least some stuff out by themselves. Post-interval it feels like the writers get the jitters and don't want to leave anything to chance. They quite literally spell out every thing. Like the film's metaphors for good and evil are clearly defined, to such an extent that they aren't representations any more. In fact, it is stretched out a bit too far.The story book + fairy tale kind of narration makes you wonder if A Flying Jatt would have worked as a kids' film? Nope. One because it isn't marketed as such. Two, because the urban kids are just exposed to a lot better – in terms of story, action and performances. I won't even bring up the CGI, etc.The movie even tries its hand at humor. It goes into spoof mode for a bit. However, the joke either falls flat because it goes on for too long  or it ends up being slapsticky. And of course, Amrita Singh and Jacqueline Fernandez screaming and squeaking respectively, can hardly be called humor. Tiger Shroff stumbling and stuttering as he plays a martial arts teacher can make you smile only so much. By the way, here's a quiz question – in which movie does Tiger Shroff play a character that doesn't require him to be a muscular guy who can do stunts, if not a martial artist? Hint: Trick question.Jacqueline Fernandez' character, Kirti just makes it a point to highlight how pointless she is. Even Amrita Singh's character seems like a placeholder for strong women, as if to check the “feminism” box. Oh, and it hurt to see Kay Kay Menon reduced to a caricatured villain. Yet again.Sure, A Flying Jatt has good intentions. But the moment you go all, “holier than thou” with speeches and history lessons, the cause is lost. The analogy of today's super-heros and villains was one thing that could have worked in favor of A Flying Jatt. Alas.

        ...A Flying Jatt provides clean entertainment - with its innocence, it evokes more Haathi Mere Saathi and less cool-cat Krrish. The film takes off only because of its simplicity - a flying jatt who's afraid of heights, a rarity in dark times of Udta Punjab...

        ...On the whole, A FLYING JATT has the ingredients that make an interesting superhero film. A section of the audience might find the film's proceedings to be corny; however, the mass audiences and kids might take a liking for the film. At the Box-Office, the film has the potential to fly, though, not to great heights. The extended weekend will help the film reap dividends at the Box-Office.

Kids may enjoy it and it is, I guess, the start of a franchise. If he focusses on the comedy the sequel may be better or else Jatt save us.

You can’t convey such serious messages about environmental issues with such juvenile ideas. If you do, you end up looking like a super powered embarrassment.

If you really have nothing to do, watch the dubbed versions of recent Hollywood superhero movies.

: good way to convey the message.
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Ha ha ha.  Trees v/s pollution. Good one.Well, wasted though.Movie is good, Tiger did the fantastic job in movie..If you watch it as a fantasy fairy tale (super man tale) with a liberal pinch of salt then it is an alright film.  Do not expect anything serious from it.The first half with an unwilling super hero, or rather a hero forced into the super hero business by his extra hyper Punjabi mom, is pretty comic.  Taking a jab at various preconceived notions about super heros, it does pretty well to provide several light moments.The second half, when the serious business starts, gets a bit preachy - but if you remain in the right mental comportment then it is a watchable film.On performances front, Tiger seems to be getting more and more into comfortable zone - quite at ease with his role.  Amrita Singh does well as the hyper Punjabi mom - although she risks getting stereotyped in such roles if she continues like this.  Jacqueline is straight out of the Archies comics books and into this film - her (colourful) dresses, her hairstyle, her mannerisms, etc. are all straight out of the Archies.  And since we are in comics land, even the villain(s) KK and the Australian import, are human caricatures of your typical comic book villains.A very light hearted film, trying to convey the message on the importance of saving the environment in a different way.  The message remains as long as the film is running, after that it evaporates faster than clean air evaporates in a polluted city.Watch it if you are a die hard film fan and have some spare time on hands.  For all the others- give it A Flying Miss.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com. All rights reserved.(Credits: wogma logo by Ain Digytal Inc. wogma audio review signature tune by Shreyas Beltangdy.
