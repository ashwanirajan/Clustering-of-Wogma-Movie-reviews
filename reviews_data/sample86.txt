
wogma rating: Watch if you have nothing better to do (?)
As inane as an action film can get. It's fight to have a relevant story is futile because it is nothing more than the usual sequences of chase sequences.Sure, Sonakshi Sinha looks refreshingly menacing. Her action sequences in the trailer catch your eye and retain your attention for the length of the trailer. But, will it do that 50+ times over for the feature length film? I have my reservations.On the other hand, Force makes me look forward to the villain of Force 2 – that one was smart and atypical. Even so, it feels like I am hanging on to straws. For all you know, a sequel will be a sequel will be a sequel. Music Reviews:
Bollywood Hungama – "2.5/5" 
Milliblog - "Force 2’s soundtrack seems forced." 
Movie Recipe - "Not an album you will take notice of." 
Times of India - "3/5"

  Movies with a social message either seem like the social message is squeezed into a story that the writers had in mind or the other way around. With Force 2 you can't make out which came first. I wish I could say that it meant the social message flowed seamlessly in and out of the story. Nope, the non-existent story comes about towards the fag end of the film. Till then it is only one chase sequence after another.If only the chase sequences had anything novel about them. It seemed like we have an action film, we have Budapest with all its beautiful roof-tops, so how can we not have a rooftop chase sequence. With an exception or two, there is no creativity in the other action sequences too. The thriller story is more or less a non-story. The villains intentions and motivations aren't something that hook us any more, are they? Sure, at least the villain here is two steps ahead of the hero so we are to wonder what he has up his sleeve. But, it never reaches a crescendo where you can't wait to find out or be bothered if you don't. For all the talk of  “why are you surprised to find a woman at the job?” talk, RAW agent KK (Sonakshi Sinha) is always a few steps behind Yash (John Abraham) – both physically and mentally. Sure, it might have more to do with KK being a sidekick and not have anything to do with gender. I guess we can take this as an encouraging trend – the lady's character in an action film is a sidekick rather than the usual pretty prop.John Abraham, Sonakshi Sinha and Tahir Raj Bhasin aren't really required to have too many expressions – they grimace, stay confused and smirk respectively. For an action film, Force 2 doesn't have any thrill. It is rather plain despite the pounding background score and snappy editing that goes with the genre. Or maybe it is a plain thriller because it has the usual things you expect from the genre.

        ...Force 2 is not a great one for spreading the message of peace. It would rather do its job of giving us stunts that keep us riveted to our seats. But it does bring up the issue of a very disturbing political tragedy whereby those who are caught spying are disowned by their own country. It’s a chilling thought on betrayal and loss, not quite the mood that this upbeat fiery and feisty actioner wants to dwell on. But it really can’t really help acquiring a conscience while taking a well-aimed shot at giving Hollywood stunts films a run for their money.

        ...Conclusion: This sequel goes one up on the first film and makes for an entertaining action thriller which actually has a story to tell behind all the brawn and high adrenaline action. The demonization issue might affect the movie to an extent, but Force 2 has all the tadka to be liked by the youth of the country. Family audiences will probably be jarred by all the action. So decide accordingly and give this movie a watch.

        ...Tahir Raj Bhasin has mastered the art of the smirk as shorthand for evil, and he has plenty of opportunities to do so in Force 2. Shiv is captured and driven to the airport by Yash and Karanjeet to be brought to justice in India. Nobody thinks to ask for back-up or, at the very least, a bullet-proof vehicle. This tribute to RAW is undercooked, but it manages to retain its crowd-pleasing flavour. The action is nasty and short, and before any “what just happened” questions can be asked, ACP Yash delivers yet another punch. It’s not quite India’s answer to the Mission: Impossible films, but at least on the thrills front, it’s halfway there.

He also manages to hang on rather well to a towel perched precariously on his mid-riff (for knowing more about the towel, see the movie). Meanwhile, Sinha looks completely clueless, as though she walked into a wrong film set. It’s left entirely up to Bhasin then to hold our interest with his blabbering, psychological games and mouth organ. He, at times, overcompensates for the po-faced leads but largely manages to hold some amount of interest even if his character itself seems like a long lost twin of the evil avatar he played in Mardani. Time, for a talented actor like him, to move on, before the supposed charisma turns into a worn-out cliché.

          Force 2 doesn't impress. John's action &  Tahir Raj Bhasin's acting are the only positives.
Story & direction are generic.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.While almost the entire reviewer fraternity gives this a 2.5-3/5, [comment partially deleted because it has name-calling] Kapoor fangirl Mrs Kabra as usual sticks to her "nothing better to do" rating for almost every action movie ever produced in Indian cinema (hold your breath, this includes the legendary Baahubali-The Beginning too).one week on and still no sign of the my comment...admins seem to be sleeping over this page these days!Was a one time watch. All the action sequence were awesome.It seems that sequels, Hollywood or Bollywood, are mostly a damp squib (Dhoom 2 being one of the few exceptions thanks mainly to Hrithik Roshan).  The thumb rule stays honest for Force 2.  The original Force, an extremely violent and gory film, was still something that stands out from the ordinary affairs hitting the screens.  It was different, the stunts were of a superior quality, the story was entirely identifiable, the villain in the form of Vidhyut Jamwal was topnotch, and the characters were real and likeable.Force2 has retained only the top rated action sequences from the original version.  All the rest is gone, well almost all the rest barring the villain who is not as good as Vidhyut Jamwal but still much better than the rest.Watching the cat and mouse chase in Force 2 reminded me heavily of the cat and mouse chase in Fan.  Similar settings (Eastern Europe), similar issues (bad guy able to infiltrate everywhere and in general be one step ahead of the good guy), the action sequences.  It is an alright watch, for hardcore film fans like me who generally have a budget to watch large number of films in a year.  For the more discrete viewer, you can easily skip this film without missing anything important in your life.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
