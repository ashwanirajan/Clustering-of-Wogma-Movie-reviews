Where weird goes terribly wrong and comes across as a desperate attempt to become quirky funny. It's been over a year and a half since the last Rani Mukerji film, No One Killed Jessica. I generally, like the films she picks, so I was reasonably excited to see that she's back. Till, till I realized she is playing a girl of a marriageable age. Not only that, but her character is all excitable and exuberant and likes to shriek just for thrills. This leaves too much scope for over-acting which is already demonstrated by the lady who plays her mother.And guess what I find out next? The film is being produced by Anurag Kashyap. I certainly wouldn't have associated his name with a seemingly slapsticky, loud film. Now, I am truly intrigued. That combined with all the rave reviews for Amit Trivedi's music to the film puts Aiyya back in the 'looking forward to' category. Also, Sachin Kundalkar as a director is a reasonably known name in the Marathi film industry and just his debut in the Hindi film industry will be something worth keeping an eye out for. Yet, I am not too sure about the south Indian reference. They looks a little mocking to start with even if it is supposedly all in good humor, but it also feels like there must be a very good reason for picking the regions of India that the characters come from. Yes, the songs have a very peppy edge to them and remind you of songs from Jitendra-Sridevi starrers of the 80s and of course songs from South Indian films. So, I promise myself some lovely mixed feelings while walking into the theater for this one!Music Reviews:
Milliblog - "After successfully scaling most other genres, Amit Trivedi leaves his stamp convincingly by delivering one of the most hip parody soundtracks in recent times."

  What? Was? That? Again, just to see if I can rid myself of the sense of bewilderment, “What WAS that?” I can understand the need to experiment and add quirk to a love story that is as simple as it gets. But doing it while maintaining the age-old norms of Bollywood, how much ever spoof-like it was meant to be, just didn't work for Aiyyaa. Aiyyaa is slow, long and tries its best to test your patience. I know, I should be giving the film some benefit of doubt because of the projection issues that the screen I saw it in had first in about 40 minutes and then a second one in another 10 minutes, which was after a 20 minute delay to begin, and following which the show was canceled. So, I watched the film all over again at the next show. Yet, I am willing to go out on a limb and say that the sheer absurdity of the last half hour is worth another “WHAT WAS THAT?”Yet, I don't write the film off a 100%, just because of the basic idea. The idea of attraction experienced by a woman because of here sensitivity to smells. Love at first sight has always intrigued me. I have always wondered what ticks. I have always imagined communication through eyes and other senses rather than logic or brain playing a role in this one. And then there was this show on either Discovery or National Geographic that was about how smell plays a major role in how couple interact with each other. And thus the concept that Aiyya uses is fairly engaging as the one line plot. But boy, has director Sachin Kundalkar overdone it. Anyway, he seems to be enamored by the miraculous sense of smell considering his Marathi film Gandha had three shorter stories connected using the theme of smell. But by the time you have seen Rani Mukerji heave while closing her eyes for the 10th time, you've had enough. For want of a better phrase and over-generalising it way too much for my own taste, Aiyyaa carries a heavy dose of Marathi film sensibilities (barring likes of Deool, Natarang, etc)Not that that is the only complaint against Aiyyaa. The loud, forcibly quirky characters that Meenakshi (Rani Mukerji) is destined with as her Marathi family, get on your nerves in the first few minutes. Amey Wagh, Jyoti Subhash, Nirmitee Sawant, Satish Alekar – all well known in the Marathi film industry are made plain weird to add to the whackiness element that the director seems to be shooting at. Well, it was an annoying kind of whacky, not the kind you grow to enjoy. And let me not even get started about Maina's (Anita Date) over-the-top, unfathomable derangement. The mockery of people who don't look normal is used yet once again to bring out a few laughs. Rani Mukerji herself is barely tolerable in general, but is especially far from that too when she does her usual shrieky self in monologues. And couldn't anyone in this heavily Marathi crew point out that just exaggerating the ph, ai, sh while speaking English and punctuating Hindi with 'aiyya' and 'aga bai' does not make for Marathi accent. Moreso, considering that she is a nearly naïve Marathi girl from Pune was the basic theme of the film. Yet, I do commend her for experimenting with this script. It's a risk and it might have failed, but that she took this risk is admirable. Also, she adds to the list of lead ladies bringing size 8-10 back in fashion. Unfortunately, her depiction of the physical attraction a woman experiences comes too late both in her performance and the story/film to add any value other than make the film look even more ludicrous. The juvenile symbolism makes it even more laughable. The climax is another box of weird worms and simplistic Bollywoodization (yeah, yeah spoof-shphoof).I have read the same synopsis at a couple of places to describe Aiyyaa, something that includesBollywood icon Rani Mukerji plays Marathi girl Meenakshi in this delightful 'Amelie'-style comedy.I just hope this isn't the official synopsis. 'Amelie' style? Really? Such comparisons should be left to the audience, shouldn't they? Also, is that what the makers are admitting to? And I guess, I have to add, having loved almost everything Anurag Kashyap has associated himself with, I never thought I'd ever say this to any of his products, “aga, aai ga!” (MUMMY!!)

        ...While Rani is ‘overused’, south film star Prithviraj Sukumaran is underused. Making his Bollywood debut in ‘Aiyyaa’, the actor has barely two lines to speak in the movie’s first half....

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.being from the South myself I often am intrigued by either the portrayal or reference to South Indian cinema in Bollywood, and more often than not I am rather disappointed. Disappointed because while South Indian cinema has moved forward by decades, Bollywood's understanding of what South Indian cinema really is, is frozen in the 80s. I have only looked at the trailer of Aiyya and was struggling to spot any notable difference between the choreography of this film vs The Dirty Picture. But Dirty picture made sense in a way because it was about a so called sex bomb (although the real Silk had more to her than just shedding clothes). May be I am being defensive here and probably a bit premature about what the context of the song in this trailer is, but I am yet to see a bollywood film-maker or film-critic demonstrate their understanding of what South Indian cinema is all about.thankswith a little bit of vexation and a bit of frustration!@nirmal hmmm..I think this is also because even TV has films from South (the ones that are dubbed awfully too) that is from those times or made with that sensibility. I'll try to keep that in mind in my reviews but I don't see the stereotyping going away in general, any time soon.Waiting, Waiting, Waiting... :-|@Harsh Sorry, it has been a not-so good week and today Murphy was at its magnificent best. Anyway, writing now. Should be out in a couple of hours. Sorry for the delay :)The trailers looked disappointing as well. Here's hoping that Luv Shuv Tay Chicken Khurana doesn't end up in the same way.@Rahul *fingers crossed* :)OH God what a let down the movie was... the story just lost steam in second half. First half was alright except for the mehak bit going on too long. In the second half I think the director totally lost it.. It could totally have been different had he followed Prithviraj's take on his feelings for RAni given that the shot they ended interval at ! It just became a case of what would have been..what a waste of good actors. I want my money back!@ligne I know! :(Direction: 1    Story: 2    Lead Actors: 3    Character Artists: 0.5    Dialogues: 0.5    Screenplay: 0.5    Music Director: 0.5    Lyrics: 1the most disastrous comeback of an actress after karisma in Dangerous Ishq.Rani is trying very hard every way to come back again sadly in such an excuse of a film@Silvan Why is this a comeback?! Her last film was just 2 years ago. If this is Rani's comeback, then Talaash has to be Aamir Khan's comeback.I caught the movie on TV. I was surprised that Rani chose to do such a pathetic movie. I really don't see anything but stupidity, bad judgement and desparation from her ... what else would justify the choice of such a movie !!!I wish you would changed the rating to "Switch channels if its on TV".. it would have saved me the trouble :-(Happy Diwali Meetu... have a good one.Cheers !!!Shilpa.@shilpa oh...you are the second person who told me i've been too generous with giving this one the second worst rating :) interesting...Happy Diwali to you too!!Wow, this is one Cra-azy movie, @Meetu! Kind of what happens when somebody falls in love with MTV....So, what's Rani Mukerji doing in this film again? She's either overqualified for this leaden bit of whimsy, or desperate.We didn't make it more than a half-hour in.@TimELiebe I was reminded of this one while watching Shaandaar yesterday :D@Meeta - thanks for the warning on Shaandaar! I'll be sure to steer everybody away from it now.... :o :o :oCopyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.

Parental Guidance:


Violence: None.
Language: One song with pretty directly sexual lyrics. Use of the word 'libido'
Nudity & Sexual content: Lots of innuendos. A weirdly dressed woman getting all horny in a song. The picturization depicts kinky sex. A skimpily clad Rani Mukerji in a couple of songs. 
Concept: A woman gets attracted to a man because of the way he smells. 
General Look and Feel: A very desperate attempt to keep the atmosphere weird.
