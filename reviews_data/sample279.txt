Khoobsurat might not sweep you off your feet, but it will take you into its dreamy, even if contemporary, world for those two hours. What makes Walt Disney produce an Indian film? You instantly feel like finding out. And you get this. So, it supposedly is a remake of Hrishikesh Mukherjee's Khoobsurat (1980). Hrishikesh Mukherjee films shouldn't be touched. They belonged to that era, they take us back there and the simplicity makes little sense in today's context. So to contextualize it of course, the film had to be taken to a palace - the last place a Hrishikesh Mukherjee film would be associated with. Everything about this new film spells fake - the queen, the prince and the "physiotherapist". You'd think a physiotherapist would have trained herself to not trip over stuff all the time. Apparently not. So, you have a Sonam Kapoor making a caricature of herself by tripping and falling over stuff through the two-minute trailer. I guess this is her attempt to fit in with the caricatures that the rest of the characters are. The hope though is in the name of the director Shashanka Ghosh. He gave us *Waisa Bhi Hota Hai Part II" which I remember enjoying. And if nothing else, we'll hopefully at least have Sneha Khanwalkar's quirky music to keep us company. Music Reviews:
Bollyspice - "2.5/5" 
Bollywood Hungama - "2/5" 
glamsham - "3/5" 
koimoi - "2.5/5"  
Milliblog - "Sneha’s inventive sounds add soorat to this Khoobsurat." 
Music Aloud - "7.5/10"

  Good romantic comedies are few and far between. Well, of course, I mean the ones that make you laugh and go "awwww" alternately. There are others that try and you wish they hadn't. Khoobsurat has honest moments that make you want to fall in love all over again and times when you laugh out loud. That is not to say it doesn't have clichés and all things that go with the word Disney, prince and princesses. In that sense, Khoobsurat (2014) differs from Khoobsurat (1980) in one significant way. The focus is much more on romance here than it is on binding the family, which is not necessarily a bad thing. The further a remake steers from the original, the better its chances of working. The biggest surprise is Sonam Kapoor. It's like she has left herself loose, like she has finally gotten comfortable in front of the camera. In many ways, she reminded me more of Kareena Kapoor in Jab We Met and Katrina Kaif in Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara more than Rekha from the original Khoobsurat. Doesn't help that the characters are all similar, but more to do with how stiff these women were in the films before these and these films saw them let go. There are a few other charming details (other than the prince himself, more on him later). The supporting characters from King Rathod's aide, Ramsevak to King Rathod himself; from the prince's little sister Divya to her mom, Her highness, Nirmala Rathod (her first name a nod to the corresponding character in the original film). The characters have slight flourishes to them that keep you interested and are played out very well by the actors themselves. The only sore thumb being in the form of Kirron Kher. Isn't she done playing the loud Punjabi mom just yet? I understand the Punjabi background comes in handy when you want to show that the genes transferred is what produces the uber-chirpy Mili (Sonam Kapoor). But, it is just tiring to see that stereotype. What it helps though is to accentuate the stark contrast between Mili and Prince Vikram (Fawad Khan). Fawaad Khan has a lovely restraint about his persona. It is like this role was meant for him and him only. While he needs to hold just one expression through most of the film, when he does need to deviate, he does it with the slightest change and yet makes it believable. What also keeps things believable in this palatial setting are some very day-to-day one-liners. The kind you and I would quip nonchalantly and laugh hard over. Some of the situations created and the way they are resolved are rather normal too. And normal in a way that doesn't bore you. That part of real life that you don't mind seeing on reel. Not to mention, for a change the voiceovers that start out sounding awkward turn into amusing train of thoughts that every one has, when they are thinking one thing and saying another. Another thing which though I really loved, am not sure if it went with the tone for the film was Sneha Khanwalkar's music. It has such a lovely quirky ring to it that you are thankful for its existence irrespective of whether or not it was meant for the said film. I don't if I should be happy or sad that they had someone else do the end-credit song. Where Khoobsurat misses out then is when characters transition. Perfectly consistent characters that have grown on you, change suddenly. It all seems a bit too convenient. A little too predictable with no effort at masking the predictability. The movie wasn't going to end any other way, you know it and so do I. But some effort at staying away from typicality would've kept the tone of the film through till the end.  Yet, it's something I would recommend for a light Sunday afternoon. It is guilty pleasure. It is saccharine sweet and fluffy. It is candy floss - it won't satiate your appetite, but will feel good while you are at it and a little after.

        ...Besides being fun, this is a sensible film. It’s non-judgmental towards Nirmala Rathore despite her harshness. The humour is never raucous and often used to convey an important point: note Milli’s response to Nirmala’s confusion on discovering that Ms Chakravarty considers herself a Punjabi. Except for some rough patches I’ve already grumbled about, this is a well-told story. There you go Sajid Khan, frothy does not have to mean foolish. Khoobsurat is proof of that....

It's a clean family entertainer with a Cinderella or meeting the Prince charming type of concept attached to it, due to which the movie ends up being another 'Disney' type of fairy tale type of love story, which in case of 'Khoobsurat' could be termed as desi tale of a 'Disney' beauty....

As the snobbish matriarch of the palace, who doesn’t approve of the loud gestures of Milli, Shah just has to repeat her Sarabhai Vs Sarabhai act and she does it with unmistakable flair. But it is Kiron Kher, repeating herself as the stereotypical Punjabi mother, who salvages the sagging screenplay by injecting freshness to the proceedings with her effortless delivery of Juhi Chaturvedi’s punchlines. She brings the house down when she questions the royalty’s fondness to address itself as ‘we’. Once again it is Manju who saves the day!...

        ...There’s no enlivening this uninteresting, feckless, unbelievingly dull exercise in futility. Even Sneha Khanvilkar’s beautiful compositions sound out of sync with what’s happening on screen. There’s no chance of careers being established or made on the strength (or lack of it) of this feeble salvo. Much more would need to be done to accomplish that. This one’s a royal PAIN…no less!...

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Warning: this section has some details that could distort your experience while watching the movie. I strongly recommend reading this only after you have seen the movie or if you have decided not to see it.A lively girl, Mili (Sonam Kapoor) breathes life into a family that has forgotten how to laugh, love and live.A lively girl, Mili (Sonam Kapoor) breathes life into a family that has forgotten how to laugh, love and live.
This one might be considered as giving the joke away, so please don't read if you like your one-liners fresh. But I so loved the line, have to put it on record - Kirron Kher's line about her daughter marrying doctor, CA, etc. Hats off to the person who thought of this line. What brilliant insight into the urban culture! 
The Sholay reference. Usually, such references work against the film, here it gelled in quite well. 
The tinge of dark humor in the way Mili treats King Rathod. 
Lovely wheel chair! 

Sonam Kapoor's love for Disney before the film begins. Doesn't help that she sounds nasal.
Sonam Kapoor's outfits. A little too out there. It felt more like wanting to set a trend rather than being a part of the character. 
How come a doctor doesn't take the patient's history of how he has been disabled? Doesn't she come to know of the backstory a little too late?
The Surajgarh palace has only one room for its guests. Yeah, right! How convenient!
nice movie is commingBooked for tonight.  Fingers crossed.Sonam Kapoor has played a character made for her, she has finally shown that she can act briliently if only corrector role has been given to her.....Fawad Khan is naturally royal , , i havnt seen any other bollywood actor to look so good in the royal look.....He is a great discovery fir bollywood....Movie has a lot of funny and sweet moments with silly(great) humor.....It has been entertaining, throughout except some sad scenes........Thoroughly enjoyed.  Feel good movie with Disney signature. Surprised by Sonam's freshness and chirpiness. She is totally natural.  The initial scene of the hero portrays him in real blue blood.  No other contemporary hero (including the Nawab) would have exuded the royalty. Mostly new faces help make the film a pleasure to watch because as audience we have no pre built notions.movie of course has silly moments, like a successful physiotherapist doesn't know basic protocol on how to address a prince. But you're willing to ignore such shortcomings. On the down side we have Kirron Kher's annoying histrionics as a (typical???) Punjaban. Kirron's behavior in films is getting as irritating as her behavior on tv reality shows..all in all a good package. Recommend it.Booked for tonight.  Fingers crossed.@ANuP @Fan agree more or less :PCopyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
