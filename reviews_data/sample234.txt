A strange case of you being on the side of the wrong-doer. Entertaining, though only in bits.You find yourself siding with a con-artist. Not just a person who dupes the other of money. She robs  emotions, feelings and wears the thievery on her sleeve. She takes offense when she hasn't been able to win someone over with her charm. She takes it up as a challenge that has to be won. Not a very likeable attitude for a person you would know in real life. Yet, you cheer for the screen her. In a sense, you feel her liberation and you are with her when she says, she might find more freedom in a prison than being locked in a marriage. Especially, given how possessive the recipients of her fake-affection get. Yet, not much of your involvement can be attributed to much about the film. It is very difficult to figure out what exacly makes you root for Dolly. The dialogue isn't very interesting, neither is  its delivery. There isn't much striking about the other departments of the film either. The music is the kind you'd find in every other film. Sonam Kapoor in the lead comes across very stiff, even a little more than her usual self. Sure, the side actors do their bit well from Rajkummar Rao to Archana Puran Singh, but none of the characters have enough depth to make themselves believable. Even a shallow character like Archana Puran Singh's can evoke an emotion if written better. It is this mixture that confuse your loyalties. The victims of the con-artists' con-job are not very likeable. Then, it all boils down to Sonam Kapoor's persona itself – the actor, not the character she plays. Her face, the fact that she is the lead lady, takes away from the film. Sure, there is nothing wrong with liking the anti-hero. But, somehow it kept me distracted through the film. I don't like the character so much, then why do I want her to get away with it? And yet again, I find myself liking a film more than I usually would because of what I didn't “get” about the film. The only thing I know for sure is I enjoyed the overall concept and felt a liberation of sorts with the way the film ended.

        ...On the whole, DOLLY KI DOLI is a stress buster that will make you smile as you'll leave the theatre. Debutante director Abhishek Dogra has competently extracted superb performances from the entire starcast. The unpredictable climax of the film works to the advantage too. But the four day weekend will help this Dolly ensnare many patrons. The word of mouth will be the key in witnessing the growth. We say, it's a roller coaster entertainer. Enjoy it with your families....

        ...Overall, Dolly Ki Doli turned out to be surprisingly delightful and light on the head by telling a story that every woman can relate to. It subtly manages to insult the institution of marriage in a funny manner. The tale of Dolly and her shenanigans are not to be taken too seriously and morality should not come in the way of enjoying this hilarious little film. It is whimsical, innocent, quirky, random and filled with the strangest of characters played by the best of character actors. If you are in the mood for some fun and not in the mood for serious films like Baby then Dolly Ki Doli surely deserves a watch. Sonam&#8217;s previous film Khoobsurat has developed a quiet fan following and Dolly Ki Doli can potentially go the same way too. Go watch it!...

        ...Even for the film as a whole, one would have loved to see more laughs since the film is set as a con comedy. However, while there are smiles galore, what really works for Dolly Ki Doli is the fact that there are no dull moments and there is something happening every five minutes. It doesn't bore and that's where the strength of this Arbaaz Khan production lies....

          :
        
        ...The film has one of the best ensemble of actors whose low star power lends the film its substance. Rajkummar as a typical Jatt is spot on, so is Varun as a puerile Punjabi guy. Pulkit though looks like a watered down version of Chulbul Pandey from Dabangg but manages to pull it off well. Sonam needs to work on her dialogue delivery and be restrained to make her acts look more effective. The plot evokes fun at times and has quite a few natural quirks that tickle your funny bone....

An enjoyable film, worth a watch....

The movie had potential to be much better than what it is and should have more detailing attached to it. There is lots happening in the film, but despite of that, the soul keeps missing at most of its place. On an overall factor,the movie is a decent, one time watch and will be liked by the family audiences. Thus, looking at its script which keeps running on and on without settling down at any point the movie should have been renamed as 'Bhaag Dolly Bhaag'....

VarshanSookhun:
          DOLLY KI DOLI is a hugely flawed yet entertaining situational comedy rescued by talented male cast incl Rajkummar Rao & Pulkit Samrat
6/10
        
ThePuccaCritic:
          Ok, Dolly Ki Doli is not bad. But the scope of the film could have gone beyond its limited characters. Good direction, nonetheless.

gmegs:
          Dolly ki Doli is so so. I don't think it was all that funny. Don't think sonam kapoor acted well. I did like the end.

          Dolly Ki Doli was a very short and incomplete film,wanted more of it then it would've been better

          "@MehraAmod: Aaj #Dolly ki Doli to uthi... Sath sath  utha.. dekhnewalo ka janaza..." lol
        
LeftOverWoman:
          Rajkummar Rao is the only saving grace in Dolly Ki Doli. Pulkit Samrat just struts around and makes us not miss Salman Khan.
        
KeepItStylish_:
          And Dolly Ki Doli is a crap. Simply avoid it.
        
KamathGurudutt:
          DOLLY KI DOLI: 2/5. Dud film. Lousy story telling, direction, and acting (Rajkumar's Haryanwi gd). Similar Marathi movie was better. Avoid.
        
kabirsultani:
          After long time bezzar bollywood Movie :p – ser Dolly Ki Doli
        
jindgijhand:
          Dolly ki doli:the film is genuinely and refreshingly non-formulaic..
Movie has no hero, no heroine, no villain and negligible star power.
        
Its_RoH1T:
          those who r watchn dolly ki doli,shame on u coz Baby is awsme muvi and seeing dis pakstn banned dis muvi
