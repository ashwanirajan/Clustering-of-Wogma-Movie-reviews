Awful. Boring. Curse Deserving. Exasperating. F... so on and so forth...Have you ever passed by those cartoons on TV which are translated in Hindi? In which dubbing for all characters seem to be done by two people - one male and one female. In which the amount of nasal shrillness defines the acting in the voice acting. The entire film is dubbed like this. Don't know what I'm talking about? Sample this -  !! WARNING !! This is just an example of the dubbing. It is neither supposed to imply that the film is entertaining nor does it mean that it is for kids.

Twitter reviews for this movie are not available.No readers have rated this movie yet.This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Aah...good question. So there's narrator (Vinod Kambli) narrating his story about two con people Johnny and Poonam who ultimately try to take control of Mrs. Kapoor's (Sushma Seth's) wealth who hates her grandson (Ajay Jadeja) who is in love with Dolly (Mahie Gill).Aah...good question.

Parental Guidance:


Violence: A few typical fight scenes.
Language: More or less clean except for some derogatory references to gay people and transvestites.
Nudity & Sexual content: A supposedly sensuous song, which is actually pretty disgusting to watch.
Concept: A sour relationship between grandmother-grandson.
General Look and Feel: A 90ish look is maintained. Nothing in it for kids.
