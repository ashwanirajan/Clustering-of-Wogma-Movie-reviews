
wogma rating: Beg or borrow, but do watch (?)
Tere Bin Laden is a subtle slapstick, if such an oxymoron exists. You'll miss out on loads of fun if you miss this one. When you are helpless and can do zilch, the least you can do is present a laughable solution to a hopeless situation.NOT A REVIEW - Just hoping it's a good dark comedy...One would think that a film character based on a reputed terrorist would use every bit of juice it can get out of controversy generated as publicity. But, director Abhishek Sharma, claims that Tere Bin Laden is not as much a take on the terrorism Bin Laden has brought about but more of a commentary on our media's hype-creation capacity and our gullibility and/or nonchalant attitude as their audience. Ironically, the reference to plausible controversy is also being anticipated by the same media. The netizens seem to be absolutely comfortable with it. And the director doesn't seem  to be concerned at all.
 As it is a comedy, even if the movie is watched by the actual Laden, he too will enjoy it and will not have any issues on it The other worry is also that the film might become a sermon to this face of evil. But looks like  Abhishek intends to do it his way . His interviews make him out to be a level-headed guy who wouldn't put things in his film just for the sake of doing it. In the same article his confidence is clear. The only 'filmi' connection he's had is working with Adlabs. He claims -Another thought that struck me while watching the  borderline-slapsticky trailer  was that is the story going to be about making Don comical - criminal lookalike being used to get to some end or the other. But turns out its just some wannabe journalist trying to pull a fast one on the rest of the world. What I found hilarious was that in this age of people getting offended at the drop of a hat, especially with movie content, one would think poking fun of the situation in a sensitive region would be cause of concern. But our censor board  seems to be living in its own little cocoon. That's not all in the funny zone as far as pre-release buzz goes. Check out this video of the Pakistani singer-turned-actor doing the rounds to publicize Tere Bin Laden. After you have survived 1.16 minutes of his singing, he says something like, "important for an actor to have a singer in him and viceversa". Mr. Zafar, how about a singer having a singer in him. You definitely don't sound too good here - No wonder not many people are too crazy about it, half of which has been inspired by Pacman-Tom& Jerry . Neither do the visuals look too engaging -
 Ps. Yes, indeed. Here's more about  Pencho, the poet.

  3 issue-based films in a day - Two related to global political situations (Lamhaa and Tere Bin Laden ) and one addressing a social issue that needs immediate attention (Udaan). Lesson at the end of the day - there are two ways of looking at any matter of importance. Bear me for the colloquial usage - one is 'load leke' and the other 'chill maar ke' (seriously and the other lightly). Tere Bin Ladentakes the chilled-out route and how!! The snotty attitude that I have towards both slapstick and satire, I'd never have imagined I'd laugh even once at a combination of both. And when I wasn't laughing out loud, I was forced to wear a wide smile at the subtle references to current affairs.

The tongue-in-cheek remarks hardly ever stop. If not words, some prop, or something in the background is vying to reach out to your funny bone. The sequences and situations also are one fun one after the other. And all this is happening while constantly making a remark on the futility of the war and the unashamed mask of righteousness people wear to justify killing each other. If not that the remark is on some stereotype. 
Every bit makes you realize how much thought has gone into making the point but without making it dramatic. While the first half is setting the situation, the second half becomes surreal or what we can easily call a Tom & Jerry affair. The transition is a bit disorienting.  But the so-silly-and-farfetched-that-you-have-to-laugh situations use dark humor, spoof stereotypes, mock media, and ridicule reality shows. They tickle, make you think, and get you worried about the characters, all in one go. 
I wish I could give out some of the brilliant understated statements made. I just wouldn't be able to take it on my conscience if I spoiled even one gag for you. All I can tell you is Ali Zaffar, a Pakistani reporter lands himself in a situation where he makes an Osama look-alike make a statement to the US. He puts together an entire crew - make-up artist, voice artist, editor, actor, and an executive-producer. You can only imagine how crazy it can get if it is done right. And done right it is.
May I thank you Mr. Abhishek Sharma for doing exactly what you believed in without heeding to supposed commercial requirements. No hero who has a heroine to woo, no over-the-top garishness just for the heck of it. I know it's a shame that we live in times that make us appreciate the things avoided in a film, rather than what it contains. But this once, we have a winner that has achieved both and more.

Just naming a few -
Zoya's "gait" when she's wearing a salwar suit.
Some of the things included in operation 'kickass'
The hand grenade sequence
Lazeez-Azeez joke
The joke on US' social security situation
The titles
The closing credits
The real Osama showing up!

Backlight while Zoya's doing the makeup, but her face is all lit up. Was distracting.
i wanna watch it...Why is it a funny movie,I don't understand.@Harpreet sorry, I've stopped reviewing non-Hindi films. Unless I can cover every film released in Pune in that particular bracket, I see no point in covering just one-odd film. I did watch Inception, unfortunately only once. Loved it.@Joydeep the jokes are put in really well.@Giftsomeone then, that would be a different film.@Samir Oh how i agree! It's almost blasphemous to say anything again Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro.
