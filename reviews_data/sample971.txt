It happened one night. Or did it? A boy and a girl met at a party - only they are middle-aged. They are drunk, they are naughty. Is it inevitable for physics-chemistry-biology to play their role? If 'it' happened, would it be 'that' happened? If 'it' didn't happen, is it okay, even if the thought of doing the unmentionable occurred to both parties. Is it worse if one of them is married and the other is only attached without legalities coming in the way? All questions that might plague any drawing room conversation in urban suburbia. They are put forth subtly and with sensitivity. Also to maintain interest there is a nice build-up. But unfortunately it's towards an unworthy climax. So much so that everything thus far seems in vain.

But, you look back and you realize though they didn't leave an impact there were interesting characters spread through the film. Each of the friends in the group is going through a different phase in his/her life. An elderly couple has come to terms with life as is and has found their way to enjoy it. Another couple seem to have a wonderful understanding of each other, so much so that they seemed to be bored of each other. And hence get themselves into situations that can complicate life. It might seem that they do it unnecessarily but maybe that's their way of keeping life interesting. Another couple is going through the initial phase of incompatibility, getting upset, and lovey-dovey cajoling. The interactions in the group tell you that even the simplest of people have complicated emotions.
While the performances of most are as you'd expect - Rajat Kapoor, Ranvir Shorey. The one surprise is Dalip Tahil. Let alone talent, just seeing him do something different is refreshing. Thanks to whoever cast him, we get to see a non-caricatured Dalip. Also, one thing that I've always admired about Neha Dhupia is that though she does typical roles of a seductress, the films she chooses to do them in have something different about them. Here too she plays the mystery woman, pretty efficiently. Had it not been for the low budget-induced low-quality texture of the film, I think her performance would have been more effective.

Twitter reviews for this movie are not available.No readers have rated this movie yet.This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.At a party in a bungalow, a couple is seen flirting when they are alone in a room. They seem strangers, are they? Something seems morally wrong, is it? At a party in a bungalow, a couple is seen flirting when they are alone in a room. They seem strangers, are they? Something seems morally wrong, is it? 
A lady wearing a tight dress through which her tummy-tyres can be noticed. Very typical of middle-aged women to do that. :)
The shots in the shower worked because they created curiosity.
The lights in CCD going out one by one at the end.

Use of the word "tota". No-no, not because its derogatory or anything, but that was the only slang used in the film, felt out of place.
The child showing up at exactly the right time, once would have been fine. But twice? Naah…her existence became too on the face.
Each frame is about whether or not one character in the film slept with another one. There is hardly any other talk. So, I'd say not to be watched by kids.Really looking forward to this movie, specially after knowing how Neha loves to flirt ;)BTW!!
