How many more times do we have to see lovers who are too cool for love/marriage? I say, enough already.Is this love? To marry or not to marry? I am sure a lot of couples go through these questions - more so now than a couple of decades ago. A lot of the hesitation seems to come from experience, introspection and knowing what they want, some of it seems to come from “we are too  cool for love/marriage” self-assuredness. All well. All valid. The question is, how many such stories can I watch and enjoy, though? I had pretty much reached my limit even before OK Jaanu.Of course, I watch one after another, the romantic in me even looks forward to almost all of them. This is in the hope for that one moment of “spark”, that one fresh insight on relationships, that one instance of being together which connects me to the characters. OK Jaanu has none of these. Interestingly individually some of the departments worked very well. Some scenes, especially those shot in the Mumbai trains went well with the pace of the relationship and its confusion. The background music and absence thereof also provided just the right amount of calmness between the mad, supposedly intense love between the lead couple. Again, individually Shraddha Kapoor (Tara) and Aditya Roy Kapoor (Adi) emote what they are supposed to. A sleepwalk role for Naseeruddin Shah (Paplu), of course. Kitu Gidwani and Leela Samson (Paplu's wife, Baby) are rather wooden under the garb of being stern and having Alzheimer's respectively. Even so, the three main performances keep you going for a bit.Then you realise that you just don't feel all the passion that the lead couple is putting up for show. It is certainly not for want of trying. But it is a bit too in-the-face for you to believe it. And it seems endless. There is only so much baseless sweetness I can handle.The only thing that worked for me is the juxtaposition of Adi-Tara's relationship against that between Paplu and Baby. While I am thankful that there wasn't an overt comparison, this contrast wasn't explored either. The steady, unbreakable bond between Paplu and Baby is very similar to that between Adi and Tara and yet it is different. Are age and experience what set these relationships apart? Or is it just the 'M' word? To begin with OK Jaanu has very little to hold your interest. What with a name that seems to be an excuse for the couple to call each other by the purportedly cute nickname, “Jaanu”? As the movie moves along, you realise the filmmakers aren't really interested in getting you interested. They are just smitten by their own coolness of having brought up “live-in” relationships to Indian cinema. eyerollSo, if you get peeved off by that kind of love-doveyness, this one isn't for you. If you find it cute...naah, even then it's not for you.

Maybe they're 'okay' with an 'okay' movie. Some of us who grew up looking up to Casablanca and Roman Holiday (or for that matter DDLJ and KKHH) for romance, could give this one a miss.

The young couple unlearning, and then learning about romance from the two thespians would have added the much-needed zing.

In fact it repeats a lot of negative traits from previous unsatisfying movies like frustrating character traits, going round in circles around the same plotline and underutilized supporting characters. It is not very entertaining and AR Rahman’s music makes it somewhat watchable. It would be wrong to say that OK Jaanu is a waste of potential because not a lot could have been done with the basic story. Shaad Ali disappoints once again as this time even a remake of his mentor’s film can’t save his movie. OK Jaanu eventually finds it difficult to be called even an OK film.

Apart from Baadshah’s version of Humma Humma —a remake within a remake, and a crime against nature—the soundtrack, with A.R. Rahman reworking his OK Kanmani tunes, screeches and thrums beautifully. Kapoor gives what might be her best performance yet, the conflicting emotions on her face in the latter stages hinting at a complexity the film just doesn’t possess (Kapur prefers to submit one emotion at a time). All in all, a film that fits snugly into a category coined by critic Andrew Sarris: lightly likeable.

deepakmulik10:
          Ok janu is a simple romantic love story ..shraddha kapoor steals the show with he mesmerising performance...
        
Bhuut_:
          "OK Jaanu" ke gaanay achay hain, but why on earth would u name your movie that.
        
BeingGeetaS:
          "OK Jaanu" must watch movie.
        
BaeKapoor:
          OK Jaanu is pretty good. Their chemistry is beyond amazing. Btw look at the way Tara is looking at Adi..
        
AnytimeVijay:

abhishe36399536:
          OK jaanu is the best movie for couple
        
abhisek_s:
          OK Jaanu is enjoyable for the most parts, despite lacking the chemistry between the leads like its original.
        
TheAnushkaDesa1:
          So I watched Ok Jaanu. ITS TWO HOURS OF THEM BEING CUTE BUT THERES NO STORY??!?!!?????? Also Ok Kanmani wins hands down
        
sabya44:
          Year 2017 starts with a great disappointment called ok jaanu...Only thing is good in it is its music..Good show A.R rehman
        
NakulnC789:
          #OkJaanu

Just Like the original, chemistry between the leading pair, music & #NaseeruddinShah character makes Ok Jaanu a decent watch

3/5
        
mysticashi:
          Really happy that I watched OK Janu.
Movie is (I don't know)* I wouldn't have watched it even on TV & missed the incredible background score
        
dearrathish:
          Ok Jaanu Movie - Just OK :(
        
VrutantMUFC:
          'Ok Jaanu' and 'Haramkhor' released this week. Your Girlfriend will address you as 'Haramkhor' if you take her to watch 'Ok Jaanu'.
        
vishesh_tyagi:
          Moral of the movie #OkJaanu & #Befikre are same. Nothing new in Ok Jaanu. 
        
VinayaJhangiani:
          The original version of Ok Jaanu was much better than the remake. Shraddha seemed fake and Aditya, though a cutie, was awkward throughout.
        
ShristiAveiro:
          Ok Janu is shit.
        
SHRIRAM003:
          Not ok, jaanu...
        
saurabhkalra5:
          Ok Jaanu... Really Really Bad!!!
        
roadrash2229:
          Dont u dare to watch Ok janu... Feeling like to commit suicide 
        
richpal_mehriya:
          Guy: Movie dekhni hai?

Guy: XXX?
Girl: Haraamkhor!
What a difficult weekend it is for movies...
        
prxyamohan:
          expected too much from ok jaanu 
        
pavanvoice:
          Ok Jaanu ....the original was headache ...this was torture ...

Naidu_Pramod:
          Review: OK Jaanu
A film made for idiots by idiots. Nothing happens in this film... just two grown up ppl behaving like 15 yr olds. Zero ⭐
        
mohitag76465414:
          Watched a movie last night... Dont know wat its name was ok janu or ok jhantu!
        
Meem_Hye:
          Movies like Ok Janu are old wine in new bottle.
        
ManaliB0103:
          Ok Jaanu is by far Shraddha Kapoor's & Aditya Roy Kapoor's worst movie till date
        
mainbhiengineer:
          Review: 'Ok Jaanu' is as bad as 'I love you but as a friend'.
        
lureyznk:
          Can't believe I watched Ok Janu
        
KushJain03:
          Instead of Ok Jaanu, recieving "hmm" from her sounds more romantic
& Even that "hmm" has a story.
#NotOkJaanu
        
kunalnss30:
          Wanted some good sleep. Watched OK Jaanu, I'm feeling refreshed now! 

(In short: Movie bghta bghta chann zopp lagli)
        
kambliamol:
          Not So "Ok Jaanu"......
        
Jainam63840076:
          Worst movie of my life "ok jaanu"
Plz @ShraddhaKapoor  And @AdityaRoyKapoor make ur choice better.........
        
InUthdotcom:
          Breaking stereotypes and more, why #Aditya- @Shraddha's #OKJaanu is a nice coming of age romance. @DharmaMovies… https://t.co/eNTLccdty8

Icy_Dragonati:
          My friend's review for ok Jaanu... It wasnt even Ok yaar... Wasted money on weekend ticket :(
        
iconohclast:
          Well, that Kapur and Kapoor have zero chemistry was evident. #OkJaanu had to be meh-er than meh.… https://t.co/gGTJoCyeUJ

iashwanibhagat:
          OK Jaanu isn't a love story it's just a love without story
        
Gaurav_se57:
          Great to see xXx performing much better than Ok jaanu.
        
DesireMaze:
          Not ok, jaanu.
        
chetanlfc:
          In 90s Rahman sir Alone has managed  to pull D crowd..OK Jaanu flopped thanks !!They would have been labelled as superstars !!

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Meetu has reach her limit for watching this kind of tried and tested formula movies. but anybody who havnt reached their limits , its a feel good time pass nit even trying to breaking any grounds. ..not bad actually, one time watch or just for time pass.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.

Parental Guidance:


Violence: None
Language: Clean
Nudity & Sexual content: A couple of lip-to-lips, a supposedly sensuous song, a couple of short steamy scenes
Concept: To marry or to not marry
General Look and Feel: Restless and vibrant contrasted every once in a while with settled and lulled. Overall, the film had a good texture.
