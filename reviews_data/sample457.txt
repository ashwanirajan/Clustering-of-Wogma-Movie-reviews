Ishkq in Paris is a story told way too many times already to be of any interest. What amazes me is why anyone would want to tell it again, when there aren't any takers for listening to it.Wow! Preity Zinta is back! One of the recent Hindi films had the lead lady mimic Preity Zinta which is when I had to come and look up her next film. She certainly couldn't already be in the phase where there would be spoofs and tributes to her, right?After The Last Lear and Videsh it seemed like Preity Zinta had long moved on from romance. So, it was rather disappointing to find it was a Ishkq in Paris, which looks like your typical love story set in a foreign city. Only this time around, you don't have to romanticize London or New York, it is set in the city of romance! My only curiosity about Ishkq In Paris, is - what is it about love that Preity Zinta felt has been left unsaid that she decided to produce it? The trailer seems to be indicate stuff that has been done to death, two strangers spend one night together in an unknown city. In fact, we very recently saw the same theme explored in London Paris New York. For sure, the music doesn't seem to explore anything new, hopefully how Ishkq in Paris goes about telling its tale of love in a manner that is different/engaging/entertaining/all of the above.Music Reviews:
Milliblog - "Two salvageable tracks is an achievement for Sajid Wajid."
Music Aloud - "5/10"
dunkdaft - "highly avoidable track"
Bollywood Hungama - "3/5"
Bollyspice - "3/5"
Apun Ka Choice - "3/5"

  You meet someone. You become friends. You enjoy each other's company. You hate same things together. You fall in love. You begin to hate each other. Then, either you get back together or you don't. Ishkq in Paris is drabber in telling you this story than the way I've narrated it. Ishkq (Preity Zinta) - yes, that's the characters name! - and Akaash (Rhehan Malliek) go through the mechanics so clinically, that it feels all but real.And aren't love stories about making the unreal feel real. Just having a dialogue that says, "This is a true love story." doesn't make it one. Nor do lines like "I love Bollywood." and "I love Paris" make us believe that you do, they only make the words "I love you" sound like it was said because the writers couldn't think of other ways to express it. Preity Zinta and Rhehan Malliek do try their best to infuse life into the lines. But, that's the problem, their effort shows. That besides there is no relief from them. There are long scenes with them talking to each other. The only breather comes when Ishkq's mom Marie (Isabelle Adjani) is on screen, and then you wish you hadn't wished to see other faces. There are no 'aawww' moments, zero funny ones and lots of times when the film tries to be superficially cool with all its talk about ex-boyfriends and no marriages and so on. It does to try touch upon the deep insecurities of the lady protagonist, but turns into the age old, "damsel in distress" protocol. You really wonder what made Preity Zinta produce this one? Except for the line she says out loud in the film, "So what, if we can't watch a film, no one can stop us from making one."

No readers have rated this movie yet.This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.They gave away first act of the movie, the characters had to practically spell their traits out louds AND the cliche Crying in the Rain...Even if I'm in a charitable mood and assume that they something new to say... I'm pretty sure its going to padded with lots and lots of same old shit(Hey, that makes a good acronym).So, Meetu - even by my American Bollywood friends' and I's admittedly low standards (we sat through 1978's 2000's DHAI AKSHAR PREM KE this past Sunday, For God's Sake!), this is a miss? I'd seen it come up as a title and thought "Hey, I've liked Preity Zinta in other romantic comedies - maybe this is worth adding to the list?"Thats Harsh!Its TRUE ..... ISHkQ in PARIS ...... Running Successfully in Cinemas But the truth .... NO ONE IN CINEMASand the ones who come to watch this move are RUNNING HOME during INTERVAL successfully@Harsh ha ha ha. When I saw the comment in e-mail, I was wondering why is Harsh saying, "That's Harsh"@nice girl yeah...Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
