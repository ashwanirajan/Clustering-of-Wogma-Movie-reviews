wogma rating: Watch when on TV/online (?) - That too only for the actors and treatment, don't expect anything from the story
    
  A love story we've gotten too used to over the decades to be interesting despite  fresh performances and a slick, rustic treatment.Love stories with characters belonging to rival families have something intrinsically tragic about them. Sometimes the pathos is overwhelming enough to make you ignore everything else that's wrong with the story. At other times though, it could be an Ishaqzaade which isn't sure about how it wants the audience to react to its characters and thus comes across as confused. Add to that a stretched out, predictable  climax and you have an uneasy, restless audience.





(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});


The first scene introduces Parmar (Arjun Kapoor) as a ruthless, uncouth brat who the audience will very unwillingly call an anti-hero, let alone hero. And no, right to the end, you cannot warm up to his character; empathizing or rooting for his cause is a distant thought. But that also says two things complimentary about the content - Parmar does nothing out of character and is consistent; Arjun Kapoor plays Parmar to perfection because the feeling of disgust towards the character never leaves you. 
Exactly the same things can be said about Zoya and Parineeti Chopra the actor who plays Zoya. Zoya is consistently immature and ironically feminine as far as emotion goes, behind all the macho bravado.  In fact, Zoya is likable despite this inconsistency because life is a thrill ride for her and death is equally adventurous too. This charm seeps through and that has a lot to do with Parineeti Chopra's refreshing attitude towards being a lead lady in a Hindi film. 
Unfortunate as it is, none of this translates into a story that can sustain your interest for over two hours. Ishaqzaade reminded me that "predicable" doesn't just mean the audience guessing exactly what will happen. A story is predicable and a tad more frustratingly so, when the audience guesses two (or more) possible outcomes of a particular situation and both (or all) seem equally done to death. 
You could do all of this in style have good camera work and sense of aesthetics but the lack of content is transparent. The dialogues lack the charm of Habib Faisal's debut Do Dooni Chaar. The references - to a woman's place in Indian society, be it a strong-headed girl or a righteous widow, and similar impotence of a man who does whatever it takes because he seeks approval of his role model - are very interesting but do little to how lame the plot is as it culminates. Social message at the end, notwithstanding.
A love story is a love story is a love story. And actually, we expect very little from it, in terms of being different. What we want is to engage with our Romeos  and Juliets, we want to feel that a Majnu should unite with his Laila, in this world or beyond. But in Ishaqzaade, you aren't even sure Ranjha deserves Heer. Amidst the endless gun shots, you are hoping for a gun or two to go with the cliche and run out of bullets, so there is some sight of 'The End'.

: dud!!!
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Nice review meetu , i had a feeling that might ave great as the director gave a middle class comdey flick earlier :D@Guddu thanks. yeah i know...but doesn't work this time.I think your reviews are far more interesting then the movie itself :)@nitin ha ha ha.@Jjj oh wow! it's great that you enjoyed!@@nkit I was waiting for you to come back on this one after our discussion about Hrishikesh Mukherjee on Vicky Donor's review. I agree with you on this one!Is it because we have a stereotypical image of a love story and also fairy tailish expectations that one cant appreciate a good ,different and refreshing love story? The movie stumped me and I simply loved it for the message of love and peace which was the central theme of the movie conveyed through the most powerful character of the movie , Param's mother and through her influence later through zoya and param. I was wondering when intermission came how was the director planning to redeem the character of param and make us appreciate and like him and I wasnt disspointed one bit by the choices param makes at the crutial points in his life , which are the tipping points in our lives changing us for better or for worse. [Rest of the comment is deleted because it gives the movie away]@Shruti Stereotypical and a dark fairy tale is exactly what I thought Ishaqzaade was and thus didn't think it was a refreshing love story. I'm glad you loved it the way you did.Meetu - I might have come across as strong because i saw the movie today and it moved me a lot. Just wanted to share when I say steroetypical and fairy tailish is when I say we expect the guy to be the perfect prince charming , to be besotted with the girl from the beginning and madly in love , goes beyond himself for love and then its justified if the girl returns it.But Ifeel love is more than that and its very powerful.@Shruti I'm all for anti-heros. But Ishaqzaade's Parma just didn't work for me. But hey, it worked for some of us and that's worth celebrating in itself.This film had the potential to be a great one....but the second half haevily disappoints. Character of Zoya was bascially murdered in the second half......but overall, Parineeti Chopra is the main attraction but Arjun is also very good. If only the characters were a little more developed...Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
