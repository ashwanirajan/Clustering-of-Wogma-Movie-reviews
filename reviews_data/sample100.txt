
wogma rating: Watch if you have nothing better to do (?)
If only you couldn't have figured out whodunnit by mid-point, you'd have been horrified betterYou are really trying to solve the puzzle along with the characters. There are enough pieces laid out for you. You want to piece them together but you struggle to fit it together. And then puuufff! You do it. Then your job is to just lay back and see it unfold. Your involvement has disappeared. Now, how far your puuufff moment is away from that of the film's big reveal moment determines if the movie did it well or not. Unfortunately, for Raaz Reboot, you figure it out some time around interval and there is long lag between that and when you're told. Other than the “why” horror films barely have anything new, right? The “how” is merely a matter of details like: 
- Where will blood-colored liquid spookily drip from?
- What is going to pop out from the wash basin? 
- When the lead lady looks up scared, what shape would the spirit have taken?  
- When will the priest be called in?  
- Which religion(s) will the priest belong to? Which religion will finally succeed?    And the “why” is interesting only until you've figured it out. Raaz Reboot checks the above list and does a bit more. However, there are a few things that it does or avoids that make the first half engaging. Like the pieces of the puzzle itself – the marital disharmony, the secret, the couple's other relationships. Also, the film doesn't leave its protagonists alone. These are smart people who go seek help or at least try to, instead of braving it by themselves.  So, you don't have the usual horror film question, “why won't she just tell her best friend?”Yet, there are way too many gaping questions about motivations like, “Now why would one behave this way if one knew that?” I am not even talking about the supernatural mumbo-jumbo.Fortunately, the performances are above what we have come to expect from films in this genre from this production house. Now, Kriti Kharbanda and Gaurav Arora have a lot of chemistry-free, flat moments. But, individually, they do well to scare and be scared. I enjoyed Emraan Hashmi's performance too. He keeps you guessing to the best of his capabilities. That he is let down by the writing department is another story.I was engaged more than I expected to be. I had inadvertently tight muscles till the culprit was obvious. But then again, I scare easily. If you want to be spooked but not too seriously, you could just skim through this one when there's nothing else on TV.

        ...Though the film has a few scary scenes, it ends up being a clichéd love story instead of a horror flick. The music by Jeet Ganguly, Sangeet and Sidharthy Haldipur is melodious, especially the title track. However, the movie doesn’t really offer you a solid reason for watching it. ‘Raaz Reboot’ isn’t a must watch this week, catch it only if you are an ardent fan of the Raaz franchise.

        ...Raaz reboot has one thing going for it; It’s not boring. You may enjoy the movie, but it’ll be for all the wrong reasons. The plot is disjointed and makes no sense whatsoever. The less said about the acting (save for Emraan Hashmi, who was decent), the better. Raaz is a horror in no tangible way. It’s almost so bad it’s good.

The background score makes eerie original sounds but it fails to rouse either fear or fervour. The cinematography manages to capture the cold, dark and depressing atmosphere quite well, the furniture looks antiquated and the actors give shrill a whole new meaning.

        ...Raaz Reboot might still go on to make money, like its predecessors in the franchise. But do we as the Indian audience need to assaulted with such banal, comical horror every single time the Bhatts have some money to make a film? Nope. So if you still go ahead and spend money on a movie like this, you DESERVE more movies like these. And thou shalt not complain about the poor state of horror movies in India. Thou absolutely shalt not....

        ...Conclusion: The movie which was supposed to kick-start the Raaz franchise is looking more and more like the death nail to the franchise. The spooky moments are few and far between, and even the ones which are there aren’t quite as impactful because the effects are stereotypical and the Vfx is downright insulting to the audience. They should have spent more time on rendering the Vfx. Ignoring all that, Raaz Reboot doesn’t work as a film either because the narrative is too slow and the pacing too uneven.

        ...Besides a couple of ‘Raazes’, one loses count of how many such pictures Vikram Bhatt has filmed in the past — Intehaa, Aetbaar, 1920, Shapit, Haunted etc. etc. Sure, it’s predictable stuff. But that’s to do with the genre, which like mindless comedy, is fairly easy to judge or appreciate.

        ...If that was not all, the amateurish CGI effects are so laughable that there is no chance of being afraid of anything that the film throws at you. When I heard that the film has been set in Transylvania, I had hoped against hope for a story flirting with the legend of Dracula, but alas! It all boils down to old-fashioned revenge and predictable twists and turns. The music is totally forgettable and except for Hashmi's 'bad boy' charm, there is nothing really worth watching in the film.
