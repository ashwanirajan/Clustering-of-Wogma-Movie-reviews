Guzaarish is an art museum.  Aishwarya Rai Bachchan is the perfectly chiseled curator and   Hrithik Roshan an almost statue. And this once, it’s not his acting I’m complaining about, the script demands him to stay put. You are watching them etched in many exotic, exquisite paintings frame after frame. So, what if the very basis of the story is pointless and there are gaping holes which are difficult to digest.Did you read about people getting offended by Laxman’s (Shreyas Talpade’s) stammering in Golmaal 3. Then there is someone who thinks Aishwarya Rai seen smoking on a poster will set a trend of guess what? Smoking! Hail the power of cinema. One of the main themes in  Guzaarish is euthanasia! That gives everyone who’s going to die a subscription to the i-am-offended association. AND just imagine the trend that the theme is going  to set!? 
And no I didn’t give the movie away. It’s right there in the promos. 

Now that I’ve offended everyone who takes death and by conjecture everything about life seriously, euthanasia is something I love talking about. And still a film about it isn’t getting me very excited. Thanks to Bhansali’s capacity to over-romanticize anything. And I can barely tolerate mere romanticization of even romance. Ok, sorry... 
That doesn’t mean I don’t appreciate his color palate. Simply mind-blowing it is. And thus, I’m looking forward to the visual treat. Oh yeah, and I really appreciate that the makers have gone a mile and more to get required permission for using some dialogues from a film that has inspired a scene in the film.
SLB incorporates original dialogues from Zeffirelli's Romeo & Juliet in Guzaarish. Was it easy getting permission to use material from Zeffirelli's film in Guzaarish? Laughs SLB, "Not really. We had to seek out people who were either long gone or in retirement. But I was adamant. This was my only chance to pay homage to one of my all-time favourite screen romances." 
Yes, it is something that should be taken for granted instead of being given special recognition. But, for all the reasons one can think of, such regard for others’ work makes me admire everyone involved. 
Anyway, that still doesn’t mean I’m going to be saved from the attempts at acting by HIT JODI Hrithik Roshan-Aishwarya Rai. Interestingly, they too acknowledge that they can influence the outcome only so much. In an interview Hrithik Roshan says, “We have had 100 per cent results till now (Dhoom 2 and Jodha Akbar). We could be lucky one more time!” 
Wish you luck!

  As I begin my trip on the wrong side of 35, I think a lot about old age. And every once in a while the thought is punctuated by the passing away of an "aged" person. People might not say it out loud, but that death comes as a relief - not only to the person who dies. Old age with ailments is not anything anyone looks forward to. "Please don’t let me live on like a vegetable," is something I hear from friends a lot more than I’d like, even though it’s only a casual remark. But, what if, you don’t have to wait for old age for this to happen. What if you are hit with this situation in your prime? That’s what happens to Ethan (Hrithik Roshan) in Guzaarish. And Sanjay Leela Bhansali paints such a beautiful picture to bring across the pathos that you almost ignore how silly the basic plot is. 





(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});


The picture is beautiful not only because you can see the thought gone into composing each frame; but also because the writing has a lot of restraint. Ethan doesn’t go into a spiel demanding our sympathy. He gains it because of the situations he’s in. From the fly he can’t shoo off to the anger he can’t vent out physically, make you feel for his despair. Of course, they had to mess it up in the end but then again, that scene becomes tolerable because it hasn't been used earlier. Yes, it has all the emotional triggers, visually, in speech and in music. Well, it's supposed to be an emotional scene, after all. And Hrithik Roshan had to get the promised amount of screen time, right?
But he, more or less, pulls it off. Often, his head dropped to one side like a mentally imbalanced person - while this got annoying, at other times he showed an unexpected degree of talent. Including the times he got angry. It’s really not his fault that he went into the over-acting zone a la Amitabh-Bachchan-in-Black. When two distinct personalities act with the same mannerisms, the one man who directed both of them is at blame.
Aishwarya Rai Bachchan stomps about the Goan mansion dutifully. She is breathtakingly beautiful. So perfect, that I can understand when I hear people say, "she is so beautiful that it's difficult to like her." That doesn't make the statement fair, but then again, it's unfair for someone to look divine too. (Sorry for this side, but throughout the film I was reminded of this comment on Guru's review where the commenter mentioned his servant looked better than Aishwary Rai, I guess Ethan can't even say that.)
I admit, I didn't expect anything in the form of acting from anyone in this film. And I admit, I was mildly surprised. Let alone Ms. Rai Bachchan hell, even Nafisa Ali had a bit of voice modulation going around. I still have to get past Aditya Roy Kapoor's cute smile to decide if I really like his acting or not, but so far so good. He has a refreshing air about him. 
A bunch of other characters do their bit. And that's my grouse. Almost all of them come in the second half. I for one, get unsettled when characters and the base plot are set and then a new character is introduced, let alone 4-5 new ones. 
Sure, they were there for a purpose. But an ever-lasting introduction to characters, especially when the conflict comes in the first 10 minutes, threw the story structure off the chart. I love experimentation, especially with narrative styles, but this entry and exit of character after character looked like the writers were filling in blanks, "Oye, we need a love interest. Hey, what about family? Hey, where did the enemy go? Oops, we forgot to give Sophia (Aishwarya) a backstory. And so on and on." 
And all leading to what? Because of this need to clarify and justify, the meat goes missing. What a wonderful opportunity there was in a story where a person is appealing to the society to kill him, Secondly, the very purpose of Ethan's extra-ordinary character and fight is defeated when he decides to do what you and I would do. His fight seems futile and to an extent the film too.
But, the point is that, Sanjay Leela Bhansali's intentions are clear from the first shot - one lyrical movement by Aishwarya even if it is something as mundane as drawing curtains. You know he's aiming for his brand of grandeur. (And he'll to stick that one grand set, even if the Indian Judiciary system has to shift address.) You know his purpose is to enchant with visuals. And that he does. He doesn't want anything close to real. Somewhere along the side he wants to say a story, but I guess, he must know too, that the plot is not his priority. So, he succeeds there too. It's just that it didn't work for me in entirety.
Meanwhile, it does create empathy. Smokers out there might be able to identify with this one better - what if someone else decided the intervals at which you took your puffs while smoking one cigarette?

And that he does. He doesn't want anything close to real. Somewhere along the side he wants to say a story, but I guess, he must know too, that the plot is not his priority. So, he succeeds there too. It's just that it didn't work for me in entirety.
Meanwhile, it does create empathy. Smokers out there might be able to identify with this one better - what if someone else decided the intervals at which you took your puffs while smoking one cigarette?

15mohit:
          Just Seen Guzarish tonight; brilliant movie ; wept alot! Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Hritik both are the best...... Must see bollywood movie
        
_alps:
          Guzaarish was not a bad movie - only it depressed me so much that had to look for some happy entertainment back at home.
        
Zeshan_Hussain:
          #Guzaarish nice film, brilliant acting however highly plagiarised and main theme isn't handled with justice, should have been more powerful
        
soumyadip:
          Rs. 60 for four balcony tickets, popcorn for Rs. 5 at Payal Cinema, Shillong. For this price Guzaarish is paisawasool. Any higher, not.
        
smartrudra:
          Watched Guzaarish (guzarish). many flawas but worth watch. donot Watch if u like to timepass only
        
sidtoday:
          Guzarish - A sad movie makes you Happy .  Good acting , but better if added  soft background movie.
        
shubhas:
          Guzaarish, according to me,  looks spectacular and has some magical moments. It is also melodramatic and over the top. Hrithik is briliiant!
        
shrutsk:
          #Guzarish....may not be the best performances....but sure is their individual best performances...full marks to cinematography...overall 3/5
        
shahid_m59:
          Wait 4 #Guzaarish is over and it seemed not bad to me...story was already known and some fine acting made it bearable..Average film..
        
Sh0kat:
          Guzarish is a great movie, but kinda boring @ihrithik
        
sforsenthilc:
          A very goodmorning folks! Watched GUZAARISH yes. More like a art film. But def. Not one of best of SLB
        
SakshiDwivedi:
          Seen guzarish...lykd it...bt wont say must watch bcz nt meant 4 evrybody
        
saket22:
          for the reviews,,Harry potter's story i didnt get..:(.Guzarish was Black-part2 ...thus both avg. for me..
        
rounakguharoy:
          Guzarish...a film, where Hrithik was at his best, but both Mrs.Bachchan n Mr.Bansali were disaster...
        
rati7:
          Good 4 one time watch RT @OPTIPRO: whats your final verdict on Guzarish :) RT @rati7: #guzarish made me think about the defination of love.
        
rameshrabi:
          Guzaarish is needlessly European, operatic. Loved the writing. Even more, the performances. All add up to fall short of brilliance, though.
        
Psrivilas:
          Watched guzaarish on friday..the movie is slow and not much of a story..But the peformances were excellent!I Salute @iHrithik dedication!!
        
paragsarfare:
          Guzaarish is very Bhansali-sque, with lot of Guru Dutt-ish elements. Cut some melodrama & awkward scenes, and would've been his best.
        
nash_moviefreak:
          Guzaarish: Gives u a feeling of 'Black', performances r good but slow movie for normal audience. Wait for a DVD.Watch it only if u must.5/10
        
mrlubu:
          Guzaarish-1st day 3rd show and very good performances by the lead pair.ok movie!
        
mearlcolaco:
          Guzaarish is a well made film. I would give it 3 stars. Catch the movie if you can.
        
KunalBilakhia:
          Guzaarish. Engaging first half. Disasterous second half. Goodnight. God bless.
        
gsk231:
          Guzarish aftr Kites...definitely a gud retake off to Hrithik after 'kati patang'&to compete wth Dabang.Still not quite meeting the expected.
        
eklavyasinha:
          Don't know what to make of Guzaarish. Great performances, brilliant camera work, lovely music and yet you feel unfulfilled at the end of it.
        
dieticianshreya:
          Saw Guzarish, acting of the actors was very nice, especially Hrithik roshan, but I think something is missing in the film, feel incomplete
        
dhavaldange:
          back  from Guzaarish.  Atleast one time watch for sure! Though not everyone will like it as no typical bollywood masala in it
        
blushing_hearts:
          saw Guzarish,,full tissue paper movie...but hritik is excellent.....may win an award this time:) he shows heros dnt need to dance to act:)
        
BeingSohin:
          Guzaarish , hrithik saved the film . Bansali told a 2 min story in  2 and half hours
        
bad_naam:
          i hoped a lot from Guzaarish but its nothing more than an avg. movie
        
anzitude:
          Watched Guzarish last night, guess narration could have been better!
        
amdavadibong:
          Guzaarish is good for hrithik. But euthanasia shud have been handled more sensibly ...
        
_reagan:
          Saw Guzaarish... Wanted to shoot in the leg so that the pain would distract me from the trauma i was going through by seeing the screen
        
_nipra:
          Guzaarish. Such a waste of time and money. Poor script.
        
Yashpal_C:
          Watched #Guzaarish today, what a complete waste of time!
        
vpsingh:
          recommend folks to skip/avoid guzaarish, mint also agrees, just an ego trip for the director who totally forgot the audience
        
viva_licious:
          guzaarish another bore by SLB .. hrithik was good tho
        
vasujain:
          I think its bhansali who needs euthanasia most.. #Guzaarish
        
vasujain:
          "Guzaarish" another torture from Bhansali... slept two times during the movie.. yawwwwwnnn !!
        
umesh1306:
          Guzaarish 45 mins of pretentious script & lethargic, incompetent direction. How the hell did Sanjay Leela Bhansali get 20 crores 2 make ths?
        
tanqeed:
          Guzaarish is horrible despite plagiarizing from Mar Adentro and Whose Life is it Anyway? http://tanqeed.com/movies/review.cfm?ireviewid=11

soumyadip:
          Guzaarish is typical Bhansali. Photophobic and boring. #review

singhcd:
          #singhcdFILMreviews Guzaarish -  its slow, silly, repetitive,over the top & manipulative.Hrithik hams & other actors have nothing else to do
        
sharansharma:
          Guzaarish didn't work for me. 1st half was dull and boring. 2nd half had some nice dramatic moments. But overall movie was a downer.
        
ShaliniSharma_:
          Hrithik in Guzarish over exposed. He very good but excessive attention to him leaves audience drained.
        
ShaliniSharma_:
          Guzarish. Visually stunning. Emotionally tedious. Bhansali a victim of form over content. Brilliant cast of characters under utilised.
        
sandyism:
          only anal sex can make your hole weak (whole week) ! And #Guzaarish was anal ! RT @rajasen thanks RT @SudhishKamath This review made my week
        
sandeep_ss19:
          To be honest... Guzaarish soooo SUCKS!! Like really... Sanjay Leela Bhansali = #Fail #slapyourself
        
sahaanirban:
          Guzaarish is a festival of the rot, the celebration of decay.. the wait for an end. There is no feel good factor. Technically it is the best
        
sachindilse33:
          Please don't go for Guzaarish.... Hritik & Aish acted well... But SLB is not able to judge the concept... Script is really bad.... ;-)
        
Rychyk:
          Guzaarish: if only SLB dintt try so hard 2 manipulate evry single scene, could as well hv put cue cards n his nxt saying Laugh/Cry/feel Blue
        
Rychyk:
          Guzaarish: SLB has got himself a heck of a cinematographer, its high time he gets a scriptwriter as well.
        
RockPrnss:
          I saw guzaarish & it was rubbish & nonsense :/
        
red_devil22:
          Movie lovers-For all those deciding between Guzarish and Potter&TDH, catch Golmaal3. Nonsense madcap fun. Gud end to sunday.
        
Rb_only4ShreyaG:
          di,pls dont.vry disheartnd wid d movie becoz u dnt have a track..how badly i hate it. RT @shreyaghoshal dying 2 catch up wid guzaarish asap
        
rajanchaks:
          Save for his first film, was never a Bhansali fan. The status quo remains after Guzaarish.
        
Raginiram:
          Watched Guzaarish. It is like the stupid person's intelligent cinema.
        
philipbkk:
          Guzaarish .....a good movie destroyed by too much direction...seriously mr bhansali..your best work is behind you now...
        
ohkhalid:
          Guzaarish...visually classy but overall, disappointing, verbose and depressing
        
nishuscorpio:
          ya i hate'd guzarish.....not a pinch of entertainment.....is 2.5hr of boredom
        
nikhiltaneja86:
          Here's a DAMN GOOD REASON to watch Guzaarish: ... okay, I was kidding. It's a pathetic movie. Don't ever watch it.
        
nikhiltaneja86:
          The worst bit about Guzaarish is undoubtedly the song where Aishwarya Rai  plays air-drums. Ringo Starr would commit suicide if he saw that.
        
Nicksvish:
          Guzaarish SUCKS!It's a hotpotch of smal scenes badly stitched 2gthr haphazardly.I thnk SLB mks films 2 shwcs his art directn & lightng skils
        
navneet3520:
          watched Guzaarish! not too good as i heard about that movie..!!
i think. . its boring.may be Flop..lolzz
        
musingsman:
          Nothing, not even TOI can save its fate RT @gkhamba: Times of India has given Guzaarish 4 stars. #justsaying
        
mumbaiboss:
          Disappointing magic aside, #Guzaarish lacks pretty much all logic. http://bit.ly/by9KrP

MemphisKaitlyn:
          About Guzaarish - SLB needs to let someone else write and he can go about making his beautiful fantasy worlds, because GUH. That HOUSE
        
mdzakeers:
          Guzaarish is one of the most pathetic movie , i ever watched

          Guzaarish movie is a big time bore, don't waste your money;)
        
LovinglyRohit:
          just saw Guzarish...love the action of hrithik, but overall the movie was boring.. :(
        
ladasingh:
          Tho I don't knw why suhel and nafisa were cast. Another issue with Guzaarish being, why should every thing be so squeaky clean and perfect?
        
KJo112:
          Guzaarish is Sanjay Leela Bhansali's unintellectual property
        
kiccha4ever:
          life is good...:-)guzaarish is just boring...
        
jayvasavada:
          Unfortunately my hunch was right :( guzarish is 'yuvraj' of SLB..songs r nice.theme is fine,visuals grand,heroine pretty bt film is boring
        
iqu129:
          mujhai guzaarish nai achi lagi

          watched guzarish yesterday. Disappointing-however hrithiks acting is superb.
        
Gagrin:
          #Guzaarish: Slow death on http://reut.rs/dkZWbW  Hrithik is the only reason to watch this film.
        
dpanjana:
          Guzaarish tickets should be sold with at least two headache tablets. Review coming up soon.
        
dirtsheetHARISH:
          #Guzaarish pathetic. . . .! Bt quite better than  #kites
        
deepworld34:
          Guzaarish is super Boring, sad and dark movie....Arre ! life is already so stressful , so why these people try to enhance that effect more!
        
deepak_narrates:
          Guzaarish = The Sea Within + The Prestige + Loads of Bhansali Bullshit.
        
Chintan_Diver:
          Saw Guzaarish. Black was way better. Felt few scenes are missing. Specially the ending could have been more stronger.
        
awasthi4u:
          #Guzarish proved crappy.
Will never watch a movie w/o reading the reviews. #decision
        
AuteurMark:
          "Guzaarish" felt like a spoof on all Sanjay Leela Bhansali films.
        
Asims322:
          guzaarish is bor movie
        
Ashuus:
          Guzarish by Sanjay Leela Bhansali...a disappointment..
        
arunjoshsamuel:
          Sanjay Leela Bhansali Did an Adapt of the Hare and the Tortoise Race; and both were classified as being to slow to finish #Guzaarish
        
arpilg:
          #Guzaarish #fail #fail #fail
        
ankitakarkera:
          A 3 hour mercy killing Guzaarish!!! yawn :-\
        
ank1408:
          Guzaarish: Not impressive. Rather watch this on #Netflix : #Christopher Reeve: Hope in Motion. A true story of Chris Reeve by himself.
        
andyisnowvat:
          #slapyourself if you went and watch guzarish...its a mixed curry with lot of movies mixed together to bring out a dumb dish..
        
alameenm:
          In every frame of guzaarish we feel hrithik is acting infrnt of camera. I thought kites was the disaster of 2010. No frns #guz is here
        
ahmedsmiles:
          Guzaarish is good movie but due to over dragging of the story it got bored. Cann't digest to c hrithik in that de-glamored role.
        
abithali2000:
          Guzaarish: its missin somthin & its an esoteric move by SLB like his previous movie Saawariya
        
2desi:
          Watched Guzaarish today and the movie was really boring, but Hrithik gave a great performance. Skip this movie, thats my guzaarish!

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Ethan (Hrithik Roshan) is a quadriplegic. As his health is deteriorating, his will to live is diminishing too. He wants to leave life happily. Only, for some vague reason, he wants to do it legally.Ethan (Hrithik Roshan) is a quadriplegic. As his health is deteriorating, his will to live is diminishing too. He wants to leave life happily. Only, for some vague reason, he wants to do it legally.
Loved the new UTV's new theme music and video
The flirty sensuous, funny scene. How I wish they hadn't put it in the promos!
The camera composition of the scene in which Devyani (Shernaz Patel) walks out of the mansion with Sophia (Aishwarya Rai) sitting in the kitchen. Beautiful!
The composition of the shot in which Ethan is sitting on his wheel chair at the beach.

How come no media at the hearing when it's held at the courtroom's new address.
How can a nurse touch bed sores without cleaning her hands!? Ok, ok...asking for too much detail, I am.
But, this is a valid problem. How come Ethan has that bed sore only for that one time, otherwise people are happily throwing him about and he doesn't as much as wince.
"Love above all else!" is that all it takes for a renowned magician to give away his legacy? Why would Ethan teach Omar at all???
The comedy in the scene between Devyani and Sophia makes you laugh but is out-of-place for their characters.
Was Ethan holding a glass of wine with his disabled hands in the last scene?
Inspired by: The Sea inside, The Diving Bell and the ButterflyI think Hritik Roshan is doing  a great job these days.But one thing I must say and that is , he is focusing his attention on roles which are more challenging and requires special efforts.The concept of the Movie is superb and one should definitely watch the movie..it is better if you watch it in a movie hall.@shruti unfortunately, the official site doesn't have the particular scenes i'm talking about. @G-10 The basic plot is "a person who is tired of his physical ailments and wants to end life is making an appeal to the court" My problem - "people who want to kill themselves, do it. They don't go about asking for permission."The smaller issue - I didn't mind the no backstory, in fact as you have noted i have an issue with the number of characters introduced.This sounds like a grander version of 'Sukhant' A Marathi film... where Atul Kulkarni fights with the system (on behalf of his mom) for Mercy Killing... I like your review style. Keep it up..@Shiv so i am told. haven't seen 'sukhant'. Thanks, I do hope to keep it up.@G-10 aah, the legal battle. that didn't quite work for me either. The last one's location was just way too distracting.side-characters: 4-5 in the second half (not the end). 1 or even 2 in the second half would have been acceptable. but 4-5 in the second half with 2 in the last 15-20 minutes was a bit much for me.evenly addressed content: the only consistent thing i can offer is my opinion, one movie at a time. i can tell you what worked for me, and what didnt. And like with any review, you decide if my justifications (not the opinions that are justified) work for you or not and decide accordingly. More on that here http://wogma.com/article/why-read-a-review/@G-10 that's a tough one, you know. I think this is my evaluated, validated view. There were things that bothered me and I mentioned those. I didn't trash the movie because of those things, because there were other things that compensated for it. Sure, there might be a movie that has just that one thing that bothers me so much that the rest of the film doesn't matter. And so on.This is the third movie Iam Watching from the direction of Sanjay Leela Bansali. Very Neat.Hats off to the entire crew. Each and every frames are painted. The Long shot of the Villa, the balcony, the pond inside the villa, climax set... list cont... Locality of the plot GOA gives a huge support to make and watch the film in Hollywood feel.Narration is awesome and its the strength of the film. Before the release critics were there like its a remake or copy of hollywood movie Prestige. But there is nothing compared to it, except the profession of the hero.Scenes I like :1. The teasing b/w hrithik and ash while she gave towel bath.3. Rain drop disturbing hirthik sleep.4. Court scene in home.5. Climax dialogues.6. Not to miss the Udi song.Very well written review, you almost said everything that I felt was wrong with the film. Except for the grand sets, exotic designer costumes, Aish's chambor lip color there was no other substance in the film. The subject needed research, court room dramas need much more attention to details... quite a lot of disappointment actually in many fronts.After my tryst with sawariya I decided to go in with zero expectations but absolutely louved it!!here's what i thoughthttp://eatpraylovemovies.blogspot.com/2010/11/guzarish-2010.html@Sanjukta thank you!@Raj individual department scores = above avg or excellent: correct.sum average of its total = marginally above zero: how?I might like individual departments, but the film as a whole might still not work for me. That's the whole point of the rating schema.Watched it yesterday, the court scenes were definitely stale. The emotional scenes were mostly good, but the movie felt undercooked. Here was a novel idea (at least for mainstream bollywood) but it was not developed further. The performances (apart from the doctor - I didn't like him at all) were good.Nonetheless, it was a good watch. Could have been a lot better though.@Samir sometimes i find myself in a no-win position with my readers. Right here, is a prime example. :D oh well. Like I said the movies visuals and some of the things Ethan didn't do made me like the film. I didn't love it, i didn't hate it, so the incisive feel is missing, i guess.On the whole it’s a lot better the SAAWARIYA!! But might face tough competition from GOLMAAL 3. Now it boils down to the audience and their mood.@minesh1963 "mood" that's the word!@Raj aaah. i thought you were commenting on my mathematics :D@abhay agree with some and some i don't. For example, this is where i disagree -Point 2. I know many people who are living in mansions but can barely afford it. they are doing it with donations, selling jewelry, artifacts, etc. Also, one can be full of like on the outside and depressed inside.@abhay all very arguable and a never-ending argument it will be@raj chill, it's cool. as long as the discussion is healthy, opposing view hardly matterso finally I watched this movie but missed the end..and I must say I was happily surprised with it for the part that I watched.My biggest problem with SLB's movies is that his sets are out of here..he  making it non real but he is claiming that it is the current century! anyway, if I ignore all that, and think of this as a play with exaggerated sets then the acting was pretty decent. The screenplay was not bad.. and once I again think that he should be in theater and not in movies!@ligne now there's a thought! you describe it perfectly.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
