Yes, I agree, coming from a SRK non-devout, Rohit Shetty non-fan and a non-believer of the nonsense genre, this review means nothing. Yet, for what it's wroth watch Chennai Express if and only if you have conceded that you have nothing better to do.Oh dear...There's not a moment in this trailer that doesn't induce a cringe, except for the one shot in which a car explodes. And that reminds you it is a Rohit Shetty film and you cringe again. From the train shot where Shah Rukh Khan lends a hand to a lady running on a platform to the drunk scene, Shah Rukh Khan is way too Shah Rukh Khan for you to take the film with an iota of positivity. Then, Deepika Padukone's trained accent sounds even more forced, even if she's got a good punch line. There's no way I can allow myself to walk into a theater with so much apprehension. So, I set about looking for more clips from the film and came across the presumptuous 'lungi dance'. It really made me wonder - where does fun stop and mockery start? A film is set in a particular geographical location and thus come the costumes and the accent. When does this stop becoming an excuse for going overboard with the jokes on the people and their way of speaking and being? I don't know. I just wonder.Moving on, I finally found something that I liked - a couple of songs and the things that go along with them. 'Kashmir main tu Kanyakumari' is peppy and the energy that Shah Rukh Khan and Deepika Padukone bring to the song makes you tap your feet. If only the setting wasn't so artificial. Another song, even if set in a tacky atmosphere, worked. Shah Rukh Khan's expression in the first few seconds of this video is heart-warming. He looks like that guy who is smitten in love rather than himself. How refreshing.Other than that there is hope that at least a little of the comedy will work. These little things are enough for me to go in with a neutral attitude. Thank goodness for small mercies. Music Reviews:
Bollyspice - "3/5" 
Bollywood Hungama - "3.5/5" 
IBN Live, IANS - "3.5/5"  
Milliblog - "But for these two songs, Chennai Express’s soundtrack is like an Amit passing via Chennai" 
Music Aloud - "6.5/10"

  For films like Chennai Express, reviews are futile, I accept. Fans of the star/director/genre are going to watch the film come what may. The rest of us couldn't be bothered with reading a review, let alone watching it. Sympathies with the latter group if you have "loved" ones in the former group who drag you into the theater kicking and screaming. May your 142 minutes rest in peace, or not. In that sense, Chennai Express delivers exactly what is expected -
- histrionics by Shah Rukh Khan;  
- beauty and gorgeousness by Deepika Padukone;  
- loads and loads of buffoonery;  
- bold, bright, solid colored costumes, art-work and props;  
- slapsticky dialogue that trots around self-importantly;  
- and some peppy song and dance.  
As complete as any Rohit Shetty film is. Well, sans Ajay Devgn. So, you don't have his cool personality to bring calm or at least a break from the over-the-top state of affairs. Even otherwise, Shah Rukh Khan's facial contortions (except for when he has this one romantic twinkle in his eyes) remind me of our origins as a race. Here, he is actually supposed to make you laugh with all the monkey business. Yet, despite all my apathy towards the tomfoolery, there was one scene that got me the goose bumps. Of course, it was too little too late.It doesn't help that not only are the jokes as predictable as every other SMS joke, the self-referencing SRK one-liners are predictable too! For the rest of the dialogue you are left with emotional/philosophical lines sound like they were picked from a book of quotes. What could have been funny if it happened once, either repeats itself or goes on for too long to kill whatever little joy it started with.You wonder then, whether or not you should complain about half the film being in Tamil. I have no clue if the heavy mockery of what the Tamilians wear, how they speak, what they eat, how they eat is offensive. But I didn't find it in good taste. The only one trying to add grace to everything else, is Deepika Padukone. Since, I don't know if her diction was right or not, I can only say she didn't look convincing. Maybe, because it was apparent that she was trying really hard.Through her character, an attempt is made to send a message across to the men of the nation. But again, the setting is way too off the topic for most of the length of the film to suddenly become about a particular social issue. All you can do is thank Rohit Shetty for small mercies - for having at least tried to make the film about something, a little less random.After this gratitude then, all you can do is come out feeling happy that it wasn't worse than you expected. And at least, the crowd around you, the people this film is made for had a good time.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Rohit Shetty's movies are not total waste ever,,,,we always atleast get some good entertainment in it,,,,was only hoping that again,,,,dont know what to expect from sharukh,,,,bcoz its always been ajay in previous ones,,,,have to waitNever before I had this big a sense of trepidation for a SRK movie... After watching the trailer I went "oh dear...this won't go down well"... However childhood fandom dictates that I travel some distance and shell out some hard earned money on this tripe!!! Having a wife who is a massive SRK fan doesn't help...mind!!!@Anup oh well. I don't know about that.@Rachit dear o dear, may the force be with you. :PI think Tammy's the only one of our American Bollywood Fan Group who'd agree with you about Rohit Shetty, Meetu! Well, maybe Bruce's wife Kathy....For the guys, your saying "Rohit GOLMAAL Shetty" was like, "YEAH! Let's GET this one!" We really enjoy the GOLMAAL movies, and even liked ALL THE BEST, though it wasn't quite as screwball.Isn't it nice to know that when you listen to movie industry types talk about "motion pictures as The Universal Language", the dialect is largely dumb slapstick and ridiculous action? ;)Shah rukh always promoted mockery verging on insult, thinking that was funny.  And South Indian community had a special place for him in making insulting fun of, just watch his previous two home productions (Om Shanti Om with quick gun murruggan and ra.one with South Indian protoganist).Somebody needs to teach him manners and give him lessons in sense of humour.@TimELiebe really? dear-oh-dear...@Fan yeah, I know. I'd like to believe though, that he'd do that to any other community too, if that's what was needed to keep people "entertained"Going to watch tonight.... Maybe I am the first one on this forum to endure this.... I will let you know my comments later... Zero expectations of this one...bad bad bad,,,,i have watched this movie with least expectation,,,,instead of that it fall short of my exoectation....this one is the worst movie of rohit shetty....Shahrukh has crossed the limits of overacting,,,,songs were so much adding to the lenth that i was playing game on my phone whenever a song starts,,,,and who have written the dialogues,,,,how could he think that anyone can laugh on then,,,,only thing which gives this movie a try are deepikas character,,,,the song 1234(what a great dancer priyamani is) and the cinematography....This movie is below rohit shetty's standard....Watched the movie. Love you Shahrukh - total entertainment.Deepika is so beautiful.@Rachit good luck!@ANuP Well then, we agree! :DYet another dud by Srk...it'l make its millions though! @Meetu: Brace yourself dear lady,u have another brain rupturing piece of trash coming up in 6 days time! Write a novel titled "Once Upon A Time In Chennai Express" once you're back to your senses after this horrific experience :P"histrionics by Shah Rukh Khan"~Sorry,buit SRK ain't Salman(gimme a Dabangg anyday) "beauty and gorgeousness by Deepika Padukone"~She's anything but beautiful :P"bold, bright, solid colored costumes, art-work and props; - slapsticky dialogue that trots around self-importantly; - and some peppy song and dance."~Again,Srk ain't Salman(u might not believe,but i'm quite a Salman fan despite his obnoxiously ridiculously films :P) No one pulls idiocricy as well as Salman does although Ajay has indeed come close in recent times (what a pity that 'coz he's a marvellous actor).A message to all "commercial" directors,leave Salman alone and please do not try and imitate him,'coz there is and will always be only one Salman Khan when it comes to bufoonary :DMeetu it seems SRK can't bring back the euphoria of his earlier romantic films that's why he joined hands with Rohit Shetty. Jab Tak Hai Jaan failed ( yash chopra ) and now trying to re invent himself with a slapstick comic director , the film was ovious to have flaws. Over the years the romantic family entertainting formula has turned cliched. Audience don't feel entertained anymore. Loyal fans who have accumulated in numbers adhere these pictures.Hi meetu,Writing after a long time, but I'd been following the reviews here in the meantime. At least the rating & quick review. Don't tend to comment because for a while, it wasn't functional, and at its comeback, you guys have made it a bit difficult. But I can understand the concern for the spammers. NM.I'd expected that you won't recommend this one. BTW, I prefer to watch movies specifically when I've nothing better to do. Otherwise, I can't pay proper attention to it, and no matter how good a movie is, I can't enjoy it as much as I would have otherwise. I'll surely consider your recommendation for this one.That's all. Good luck, and mind you that I'll be inspecting the site from time to time ;-)@Anuj Really, Deepika isn't beautiful. I find her drop-dead gorgeous :D@Guddu I think the same cliches are being reinvented in romance in the likes of Aashiqui2 and Lootera. Not in this one, but there is always hope.@Lost In Confusion Good to have you back. I'm sorry about the inconvenience of putting a captcha in while leaving a comment. If you login though, you don't need to enter that. So, please consider. Thanks again for your patronageWell it lived up to expectations... didnt it! Problem is coming after the last movie I saw (BMG) it feels a bit underwhelming to crow about Chennai Express...It isnt a great movie or even an entertainer by any stretch... does what it says on the pack and just about manages to stay on the right side of being mildly humorous... As a North Indian having discovered Tamil cinema over the last 5 years, the caricatures of that community jar big time... But maybe thats what get the whistles these days... How would I know... Never understood Salman cinema (the ones not blatantly copied from down south)!!! Two positives though: (i) Deepika Padukone (any other new actress with this much growth in her acting capabilities???) (ii) I am a bit conservative types who still considers going to cinema as family time. After some time a movie where you will not cringe and watch it with your entire family. The complete absence of toilet humor and below the belt jokes was a welcome change!I think I will safely skip this one :-) Cannot spend 142 mins watching utter, excuse my French, "BS" !!!@Rachit Agree. Though I would have liked it better if Deepika Padukone had to do more than add a 'ti' at the end of every sentence. I liked 'that' one scene at night though :D@kunal finally, someone who actually follows their heart! :PA complete BOAKWAAS !!!!! ..It was much awaited , movie this year, but it seemed it was a remake of DDLJ in Rohit Shetty style , where SRK really  overreacted.. ( has lost his romantic charm !!! )... Deepika tried really hard to get that tamil accent.( not sure if she has got it right ) .. my Tamil friends would be ablt to tell that :).It was only for my 7 year old son  , who is a die hard SRK fan !!!! I was in that chair in the Multiplex...or else I would have got down that " chennai express " .. train much much before......@ Meetu... I think that blame can be laid at the director's door... But yeah everything was way over the top!!! However I did like the self referencing humour...@Meetu - were you channeling "Drive-In Movie Critic" Joe Bob Briggs there in your review for a second? :D You had your own "Drive-In Totals" and everything! (starts at 2:00)Direction: 1.5    Story: 1    Lead Actors: 1    Character Artists: 0.5    Dialogues: 1    Screenplay: 0.5    Music Director: 1.5    Lyrics: 1.5It is a long weekend in Singapore (4 days) and I didn't anything else to do so as Meetu suggested I went to watch the movie and in a nutshell I would say that I enjoyed it and would say it was worth the money spent... The hall was full and at few places there were some people whistling (I experienced that probably the first time since I left India :)I generally watch movies to forget any worries in real life The Good: Deepika, Clean script (family friendly - my kids laughed thru-out)The Bad - Overacting SRK - but that's usualThe Ugly - Songs ! The only time I got bored when the songs were playing..Its worse than Policegiri as per you? Why bother reviewing at all....   It was a good movie. Not awesome, but a good second half.  SRK and Deepika were excellent. Did not have a script, but if you were looking for a script in Rohit Shetty movie, its your problem, not his.Rohit Shetty makes really bad movies. I couldn't believe ppl actually liked golmaal either. Our film industry is all talk and no meat and absolutely no creativity, just making money thanks to our billion+ population who have no other choice.Apparently 5 million people had nothing better to do this weekend. 100 crore odd in 3 days.   Meetu you are so off the mark!@Shaznin :D The things we do for our kids ;) @Rachit yes-yes, ofcourse.@TimELiebe No clue what that is. Checking it out. :D@Suman :D Yep!@Anil That's cool!@Lostinlamancha "Why bother reviewing at all..." Wouldn't be much of a review site, if I only reviewed films that I like. Or let's say that would be another site. :DAlso, I never claimed to know if a movie would be a hit or not. All I know is why I liked or disliked a film. :D@TimELiebe he he...watched the video. Every once in a while it does seem like the makers made a checklist that they ticked off while making the film, doesn't it?@Meetu - glad you found Joe Bob amusing! And yes, that's why he has his "Drive-In Totals", because movies do sometimes seem to be assembled by a checklist. :)You are the worse reviewer ever; imagine u gave Singham a bad review and Raone a good review, either something is wrong with u or SRK paid u for that review, obviously CE is not ur cup of tea so why bash it to prove u have more class and education that the dumb masses like us who watch it and love it, these movies are a lot of fun and joy to us and u come off as stuck up and a kill joy, we watch reviews to know whether a movie is worth it, u obviously rate movies poorly, ur biased to what u like, u should not review movies in this genre cuz u obviously hate them..........Dear Meetu, "I want to see Chennai Express flop, because the type of movies Rohit Shetty makes, the type of atrocious sensibilities SRK & his clique has towards south Indians!" Oops! CE crossed 200 crores!? Let me go and see what is it about. I went to see Chennai Express. Barring not being too sensitive on serious flaws in South India typecasting - I liked it! I have also been a critic on imdb (>150 movies) and a quality of being good critic is to be an audience who likes good movies. I think many critics loose that innocence while analyzing, thinking and being prisoner to their own projections of earlier reviews. I think CE was a real fun movie! Didn't expect it that way. Pleasantly surprised!Old and haggard - SRK manages a BLOCKBUSTER HIT.@Raj oh well, once again, to each his own. :DTop Hindi films in the US/Canada in 2013  1.  Dhoom 3  -  $8.1m  2.  Chennai Express - $5.3m  3.  Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani  -  $3.8m   4.  Ram Leela  -  $2.7m  5.  Krrish 3 $2.2mSRK was the only superstar without an  alltime highest grosser, nice things turned aroun this year.Chennai Express had the 3rd best box office trend behind Aashiqui 2 and Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani.SRK was trying too hard, did it work , no for me and yes to those who made it a blockbuster, though i enjoyed the use of lungi.Imagine a collaboration between paglapuri and bhojpuri masala superstars.When is thakur of paglapur releasing.    Set for last day, last show.Bhojpur express on Eid 2014 in telugu style.On Eid 2016 comes the king of Indian superheroes Krrish 6.Dhoom 4,  Abhishek & Uday come to catch SRK and his lungi turns to a bike and he begins to ride all over Sunderland with little coveringbelow the hips, afterward the bike becomes a lungi.@Meetu - finally saw CHENNAI EXPRESS, and it was exactly what we'd all hoped for in a masala . Not great, but certainly entertaining - and say what you will about Shahrukh Khan, even in his late Forties he can still pull off the action stuff and look great doing it. Deepika Padukone is lovely and really very good, and always works well with SRK.It's kind of old-fashioned and silly, but I kind of liked how he and Deepika Padukone had to pretend to be married - and found as they did that they liked being a married couple, even a pretend-one. Since the two leads have good chemistry, they sell that part very well - so you can believe it when ::okay, in Spoiler Territory Here!::Anyway - even Tammy liked it, which is something I never thought I'd say when it comes to a Rohit Shetty Joint! :D@TimELiebe oh well...::Cheesy Cardiff Grin!:: Hey, I'm a guy - and an American!
