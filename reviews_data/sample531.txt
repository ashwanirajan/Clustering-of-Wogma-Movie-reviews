Exactly what we expected. At times, that's a good thing, getting what you came for. At other times, like this one, it is loud and insufferable.If I get bored out of my mind watching such films again and again, don't the makers get bored of making them again and again. Maybe, it's because each team/person doesn't make as many as I watch. Fortunately. Khiladi 786 is yet another one of those painfully non-sensical, supposedly comic ones that you'd hesitate calling a film.Khiladi 786 actually makes it too easy for a viewer to rip it apart. Every department is so awful at its job that you could begin anywhere to criticize it and that would be the right place to start. From action to editing to music to acting to dialogue to choreography - all you want to do is tear-your-hair-apart, but since you can't do that you just end up cringing. So much so that I am confident I could say the same thing about the story had there been an effort to write and tell one.Do not be fooled by the initial set-up where you have a fake, macho police officer who plays Robin Hood and wants a woman to woo (Akshay Kumar); a mafia-leader called Tendulkar (Mithun Chakraborty) who has a sister (Asin) he wants to wed off; and a want-to-be match-maker (Himesh Reshammiya). A couple of lies later, you know the writers thought that's all that's needed to make a full length feature film.Can you really blame a music director/singer turned actor turned writer to not know how to develop an idea into an enjoyable story? Not that that idea was great to start with, but we barely can tolerate him as a music director. And I want to erase the memory of Himesh Reshammiya trying to mimic himself by going double nasal in a song he sang for Akshay Kumar. In addition, his attempt at comic timing and pulling faces to draw a laughter from the audience only reminds me of school plays. Also, shouldn't it be a criminal offense to create a tune that is not only annoying but gets stuck in your head? I'm talking about 'khiladi bhaiyya, khiladi bhaiyya, khilaaadhi' which is repeated often enough in the film to get on your nerves and shamelessly flaunts its existence after you are out!Anyway, it's a shame to see Mithun Chakravorty and Raj Babbar in such pithy, meaningless roles. Even if it has all kind of Gunda references for the former. And actually, it's a shame to see even Akshay Kumar put in his all for this one. Asin gets to play the same-old loud-mouth, brash woman. No creativity whatsoever there.A lot of the fun is supposed to be had from the 'action' in such action comedies. And usually, I complain about the camera doing the action instead of the actors or their stunt doubles. But, funnily enough, here 72 Singh aka Khiladi 786 aka Akshay Kumar is a Speedy Singh. Which means he moves so fast that you cannot see him. And guess what? Shoddy editing is used to make things go missing to 'show' this action. It is outright insulting, patronizing and frustrating - all at once. Which pretty much summarizes all of Khiladi 786 - insulting, patronizing and frustrating.

awesomewax:
          Khiladi 786 offers nothing new. Akshay Kumar is dull and uncharismatic. Good performances from Himesh/Mithun 2/5
        
apoorvsharma007:
          The only advantage of Khiladi 786 is that it serves as a proof that ROWDY RATHODE Is not the worst released film of 2012
        
ankitdgogri:
          Khiladi 786.... Waste of time, but time passed when u have spare free time.... :p #movietime
        
amna_ikram:
          What a wastage of time  Khiladi 786
        
AgniBankai:
          I think Akshay Kumar should watch Khiladi one more time,then watch Khiladi 786 & realise how much raping of the Khiladi name has happened.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.good movie@sagar To Each His Own@divyanshu Thank you! I'm glad there's someone who appreciates. :D@B H Harsh naah, can't let such movies get to me. Not angry, more bored and slightly frustrated. :)@Divyanshu :) thanks. Apologies about the rating goof-up. It's a technical glitch we have been working on.I think Akshay should now stop working in such pictures every now and then he does one such movie.Meetu - weren't the KHILADI movies originally supposed to be somewhat serious? Or were they always meant to be tongue-in-cheek, and we recent American fans just weren't up enough on Bollywood culture to be in on the joke...?Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.

Parental Guidance:


Violence: Nothing gory. The usual slapping around and beating up.
Language: A few references to the ones related to mothers and sisters. But nothing direct.
Nudity & Sexual content: A couple of songs with skimpily clad women. 
Concept: An attempt at making the audience laugh at the expense of not having a concept.
General Look and Feel: Loud and bright, in a jarring way.
