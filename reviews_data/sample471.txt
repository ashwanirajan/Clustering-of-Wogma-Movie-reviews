Ek Thi Daayan builds at a good pace and takes the proceedings to a great peak at mid-time. Unfortunately, it goes only down after interval. Yet, there are a few genuine scares and good performances. A casual DVD watch.Who knew that a Hindi horror film would invoke my genuine curiosity? I didn't. Of course, that Vishal Bharadwaj is associated with the film has a lot to do with the intrigue. Also, even though I didn't like his latest films as much as his earlier ones, there is faith, that the movie has a good chance of being good - either story-wise, or in treatment or it will entertain. We know it is not going to be a complete downer. And this is when he's not even directing the film.Kannan Iyer does manage to create the right atmosphere for a horror to work in. Even if, the story might not be all that different from your regular super-natural horror, the treatment and performances look like something that could be worth the time and money by themselves. Meanwhil, the music is a lovely Vishal Bharadwaj-Gulzar combination and I, for one, am enjoying the music.Music Reviews:
Bollyspice - "2/5"
IBN Live - "3.5/5"
Milliblog - "Quintessential Vishal Bharadwaj-Gulzar soundtrack, this!"
Music Aloud - "8.5/10"

  I wonder if a ghost/witch story is, by default, a good vs. evil (pun intended) story. Ek Thi Daayan tries to underline it further, if possible. The able cast and gripping first hour, unfortunately, can't do much for the dwindling, unwieldy second hour. Yet, it is not your typical Hindi horror film, it does manage to get you nervous a few times.The first half has a lovely build-up indeed. It is interesting to see the creative interpretation of a child. I also loved the way it keeps you hanging between a child's imagination and that you don't want to believe it. Even so, a connect with the characters is missing. You don't know why you are supposed to feel for this cool magician who seems to be disturbed by some hallucinations. You don't know why you should care for this couple. The backstory comes, but a little too late for you to go back and have feelings for the characters. Also, whatever emotional attachment you are made to have is more because there are children whose safety is  involved. But, that doesn't last too long. Yet, you are gripped by the situation in the backstory. Another major contributor to keeping you rooted to your seat is the cast. All the main leads from the kids to Emraan Hashmi perform well. Can't say the same about the supporting actors, especially Pawan Malhotra or Rajatava Dutta. The kids on the other hand Vishesh Tiwari who plays the young Bobo (Emraan Hashmi) and his younger sister behave like children would and that is always refreshing to see in our films.Thankfully, there is one thing you come out with and it is Konkana Sen Sharma's haunting face. As much credit to the makeup and special effects department as it to her naturally beautiful eyes and her use of them. Emraan Hashmi gets to play the quintessential spooked out guy, in this horror film. So he gets spooked, alright. Huma Qureshi has a more or less plain role and does whatever little she can do with it. Kalki Koechlin has the smallest roles of them all, but she creates an intrigue about herself that is consistent. The inconsistency is all reserved for the last hour of the film which comes with random songs and even worse twists. At the end of the film, there are few sub-plots that make you wonder why they found a place in the film at all. On the other hand, there are some themes that are touched upon but left half-done, like a child's dreamy world, or the struggle between good and bad or logic and faith.And as is usual with all horror films, why don't witches and ghosts go directly for the kill, instead of trying to warm their subject up to themselves or killing random people associated with subject rather than the subject themselves. In that sense then, Ek Thi Daayan is like any other horror film. Thankfully, it varies from them in that it tries to stay clear of the standard mechanisms of horrifying - loud background score, etc. It also does creep you every once in a while. If only, the climax was at interval point.

          Ek thi daayan ....a awesome movie
        
VinayCharaniya:
          http://www.musicaloud.com/movie-reviews/ek-thi-daayan-movie-review/ Reviewed Ek Thi Daayan for @MusicAloud...brilliantly scary in the first half...but loses the plot in the end
        
vikrant_chauhan:
          Ek thi dayan doesn't scare much but is made well jst like Hollywood movies, Infact I can c traces of 'Supernatural' tv series. #fb
        
sahil1420:
          Ek thi daayan.first half good,second half average
        
Pentropy:
          Ek thi daayan. Predictable. Forced chill scenes. A few good moments. Mostly average. Konkana acted brilliantly.  2.5 stars. #review
        
PardeepThakur_:
          Ek thi Dayan is not must watch 2.5 What I will go with..
        
maggi_nnn:
          EK THI DAYAN.. not too scary.. but quite acceptable as overall movie :D liked it !
        
LizaSaha:
          Ek thi daayan should only be watched for Konkona and the kids. Gripping first half which turns flat at the end.
        
Kneeche:
          Go watch Ek Thi Daayan everyone.. The first half is to die(n) for! There's an amazing concept there, it's sad how the second half screws up!
        
jodhussain:
          Ek Thi Dayaan. . Its all about pressing floor 6 button thrice in elevator ;) one time watch .. 2/5 #bollywood #movies
        
Jatanking07:
          Konkana, a super horror look of daayan in the movie EK THI DAAYAN. Great acting, loved it. But the movie was not as good as expected .. !!
        
jahanbakshi:
          EK THI DAAYAN is nice till it keeps things ambiguous. Wish it stayed that way... @konkonas is killer!
        
iChetanC:
          Ek Thi Daayan! Something new and interesting. Konkona and Emran were too good. But many glitches and end pretty bad. 1½ out of 3 stars.
        
aknomics:
          Ek thi Dayaan - An average horror movie with a few interesting sequences. The kids outperform the adults in the acting department. 1/2
        
abhinavbajaj_94:
          Ek thi dayan-A good movie to watch nly till 1st half but really dnt undrstnd why a vishal bhardwaj film became a RGV movie in the 2nd half..
        
visualfumble:
          Ek thi daayan. Such a bad film.
        
VGLICIOUS_:
          Don't be fooled by reviews...Ek Thi Daayan is nothing but a sloppy and failed rip off of 
Insidious. | http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1591095/?ref_=sr_2

upasana89:
          I saw so many good reviews on Ek Thi Dayaan that I was expecting a little too much from the movie. Thoroughly disappointed.
        
thebongbabe:
          Ek Thi Daayan. A good comedy.
        
SyedBuzz:
          It is shameful how critics r sold today 3/4 stars to Ek thi Dayan the film propagating superstition ..shameful
        
sunil_gajjar:
          "Ek Thi Dayan" ....Please Save Your Money And Time .." Tu Cheez Hai Badi Bekkar Daayaam".
        
SnehaKanaya:
          Why do most Hindi movies start off so well and then end so horribly? Latest disappointment: Ek thi daayan.
        
shriikant:
          Watched ek thi dayan. Totally avoidable. Most regretful decision of the weekend. But then they lure with such attractive starcast
        
ShivaKumarD:
          Ek Thi Daayan: First half was average (flashback was too good though), second half was bad. 2/5. 
Such a wasted effort.
        
Savy_Gr:
          Ek thi daayan...despite critics high rating its a big time bore...its a dark movi..
        
RoshniLad7:
          got to say that ek thi dayaan is a massive flop! horror? a load of coblets!!!! @nehar_ullah

JayShrivastav:
          Ek thi dayan is bad movie
        
hippiebaba:
          Ek thi daayan is more of comedy than horror film
        
HarshSabale:
          Watch Ek Thi Daayan for a sliver of 20 mins before the interval. The rest of the movie is an insult to ones intelligence & money.
        
gbhimani:
          Is horrible an adjective for horror? Then Ek Thi Dayan succeeded. Horrible film! Like three scary moments. The rest ridiculous. Pity.
        
DiveshIdnani:
          Ek thi Daayan has been watched and not liked. #CantBelieveIHaveYetToWatchTheCroods

          Ek thi Dayan was fucking crap. 700 rupaiye paani me
        
arnab822:
          If you are reading this, DO NOT watch Ek Thi Daayan. Or if you must, WALK OUT at the interval. The second half is intolerable.
        
anilbajao1:
          just saw ek thi dayaan, people said it was scary, i did not get any chills.
        
anchalarneja:
          Watched ek thi dayan. Hahha. Not all scary. Feeling like a dayan who wants to kill the story writter.
        
ameyadalvi:
          Ek Thi Daayan shud be co-sponsored by Dabur Amla kesh tel n Godrej Shikakai soap. Too much hair in movie but not many hair-raising moments

: Good luck to Emraan Hashmi as he turns director for Ek Thi Daayan
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.A magician with many tricks up his sleeve (Emraan Hashmi) often gets distracted by a little girl calling out to him. Is she his hallucination or is she visiting him from the other side?
Side note: It is a shame that the makers have to so many disclaimers before they can get on with the film. Just so the next group of people doesn't get offended.

Just so the next group of people doesn't get offended. 
The opening shot. Created a nice spooky feel. Unfortunately, it didn't stay for too long.
Scenes where there was no background music. Few, but worked well.
The sound of waves in the background, in a couple of scenes.
Lizards don't scare me, but I can just imagine the advantage the film has over people who are creeped out by lizards.
The concept of hell and how one gets there.
Konkana Sen Sharma's first look! The first time you see her on screen and you are spooked.
The fake happy look by Vishesh Tiwari.
The similarity between a lizard's tail and a witch's braid. 
The Voldemort-style decomposition of the evil spirit.
That Bobo (Emraan Hashmi) goes after random women's braids. 

Bobo! What kind of a name is that?!
How does Tamara fall off the balcony? Not that I am asking for detailed explanation, but even half an explanation that would make me speculate on behalf of the write, would have been good enough.
Hypnosis was used to just as a medium to go for a flashback. Wish it was used as therapy. 
The angle between Bobo's dad (Pawan Malhotra) and Diana (Konkona Sen Sharma).
Sudden good humor that we find Bobo in, when he meets Tamara at the hospital. 
The wedding song!
Found it hilarious that Bobo's house had the typical psychiatrist 'S' chair as a part of the furniture.
Whatever happened to Lisa's obsession? What about the promise Bobo makes to her?
Why is Tamara wanting to sell Bobo's flat?
The logic that only an innocent soul should be cutting the witch's braid off is contradicted in the film, itself.
Lisa's lame story to explain where she was when the entire action was on. 
A few more holes in the story which give the twist away.

Why was a child dressed in full-sleeved shirts and trousers, even at night? I think I saw him casual wear which was a night suite, only once.
I really hope that is a good horror movie. I feel sad looking at the regular so called horror movies which are either just sleazy, ugly, gory or just run of the mill Ramsay brothers (or the likes).. With such wonderful new filmmakers trying different subjects, it's high time we make some good horror movies as well.I would love to pay to get scared :)@Anil agree completely! Except for love to be scared. I don't like that creepy feeling. But, I'm game for a movie well made. :DThis movie is directed by  Vishal Bharadwaj so we can hope it might be a watch-able movie. music from this movie is also great.. specially "Yaaram" sung by Sunidhi Chauhan, Clinton Cerejo@james well, it's not directed by Vishal Bharadwaj, he's the producer.The movie seems to have beautiful story along with the horror tale@Meetu : Finally a good supernatural thriller coming from b-town? I haven't watched it but i guess its not exactly "horror".Its good,,,,and a small relief to the horror genre,,,,with some diffrent topic as compared to other horror movies in bollywood ,,,, credit goes to some goose bump horror sequence,,great acting by konkana sen ,, superb makeup of konkana,,a slightly different story by vishal,,and the melody yaaram,,,,but the climax dissappoints,,,,but its a one time watch for sureAWESOME MOVIE...IT IS THE BEST HORROR MOVIE OF BOLLYWOOD AND EVEN CAN COMPETE WITH MANY OF THE "SO CALLED" HORROR MOVIES OF HOLLYWOOD..      THE SCREENPLAY, THE DIRECTION, THE ACTING, THE DIALOGUES,BACKGROUND SCORE, EVERYTHING IS THE BEST EVER IN INDIAN CINEMA... MORE THAN HORROR IT IS A DARK SUPERNATURAL FILM...EMRAAN HASHMI, KONKANA,,,AND YOUNG BOBO (VISHESH TIWARI),WERE OUTSTANDING..THEY DESREVE ALL AWRDS AVAILABLE THIS YEAR...
