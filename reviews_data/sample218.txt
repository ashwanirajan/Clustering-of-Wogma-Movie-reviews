Good performances. Despite desperate attempts to be different, Bewakoofiyaan is only as interesting as the ups and downs of any relationship in trouble. Director, Nupur Ashtana's previous film, Mujhse Fraaandship Karoge was a surprise, pleasant enough to   make you look forward to her next film. It had a nice, young zeal about it that was contagious spreading to its viewers. To top the cake with a cherry you have Ayushman Khurana who seems so effortlessly natural in whatever role he plays. So much so that he makes you look forward to his next film even if you don't like the previous one as much. Sonam Kapoor has the potential to tip the balance either way.The spoilsport then, is played by the rundown theme. Father doesn't want his daughter to marry the boy she likes, really? Aren't we done with that, already? But, then again, Nupur Asthana has proven once what she can do with done-to-death themes. She just might be able to pull this one through. Music Reviews:

  Almost everyone who is reading this review is in or has had a romantic relationship like you see in Bewakoofiyaan. And it would be a rare couple, if at all, who hasn't had a fight. Would our story make for a good film though? Most likely, not. Not because we make for boring people but because it's everyday life. So, does everyday life not make for good films? It does, but it needs very special skills and an out-of-the-box way to go about the story to make for an engaging story. Bewakoofiyaan is not that story.Bewakoofiyaan has an energetic, aspirational, young couple in Mohit (Ayushman Khurana) and Mayera (Sonam Kapoor). You relate to them because they are more or less like you. You start rooting for them from the very beginning. Ayushman Khurana's comic timing and chemistry with father-in-law-to-be (Rishi Kapoor) keeps matters light and engaging for a bit. But, soon enough things start getting repetitive and before you know it, you have started predicting the next sequence pretty accurately. Ayushman Khurana does go through the whole "down" time pretty convincingly. Sonam Kapoor too goes does the middle class lady who takes her success in stride while being a supporting girlfriend and a caring daughter with ease. But decent performances by the three main characters cannot life the film from the general bore that it is. Sure, Bewakoofiyaan does try to be different in how the adamant father's reluctance to warm up to the daughter's boyfriend. The lead pair's characters are also pretty close to earth in an urban way.Mohit  adequately goes through the phases of over-confidence, confidence, insecure and then bruised ego as any young man who has lost his job would. Mayera is always there for Mohit, aspirational yet in control of those aspirations. It can be argued that she sacrifices her career goals and isn't the woman of today's day and age she is made out to be. But, I'd give the writers that. I'd say Mayera knows what are priorities are and doesn't care how we judge her for them. It is a shame then, that despite characters written with more thought than you would see in your average Hindi rom-com, Bewakoofiyan ultimately falls below par. A huge part of the blame can be taken by the film's pace. The love between the couple, the father's sweet reluctance takes its time to build up. The fallout between the couple while the father-son-in-law relationship takes its own turn is cumbersome yet not intolerable. The problem is with the climax which is both rushed and over-simplistic in its writing and execution. Especially, when compared to the rest of the film. The same old clichés kick in with double force which makes you feel, you sat through all of that for this? With very little going for it in the music and other technical departments then, Bewakoofiyaan feels like listening to a friend's woes about their relationship - with empathy and love; but you want them to kiss and patch up, already. So, that you can move on too.

: Both Men Deserve Each Other - NEITHER Deserves Sonam Kapoor!
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Although Sonam Kapoor is extremely gorgeous ,, but i havnt liked her acting capabilities in any of her movies except Delhi 6 and  Bhaag Milkha Bhaag......I think Rakeysh Omprakash mehra is the only director who has controlled Sonam correctly,,,,I fear she can spoil the movie......Even in a brilliant movie like Ranjhana her part of acting is just SO-SO........@Anup I am sort-of neutral on Sonam Kapoor. Doubt this is going to be the role for her to display any acting skills that she hasn't shown yet.@Anup i am sort of agree with you but i think she was also good in Mausam though the Movie was a big let down.Ranjhana i think you hate her more than love and i think for that the credit should be given to her.@Siddharth that is true :D@Siddharth - I didnt hate her in Ranjhana,,,,Her characters have alot of scope ,,,, but she acted so tailor made,,,,even the crying scenes are let down......But yes she was good in mausam too......@meetu- true but whatever trailer shows,,,,she again seems tailor made to me.....Very few reviewers have given thumbs up to this,,,,not including wogma,,,,and most of them have said that sonam was totally flat,,,,saving my money i will end up watching this one on my lappy when i will have nothing better to do....."So, does everyday life not make for good films? It does, but it needs very special skills and an out-of-the-box way to go about the story to make for an engaging story. Bewakoofiyaan is not that story." Vikas Bahl could do it quite brilliantly in Queen.@Anup good call, I say@Kapil Well, I don't think Queen as an everyday life story. How many small-town girls go off to their honeymoon by themselves?Any chance of getting preview for Ankho Dekhi (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3yKUHI2mE4) up soon?@meetu : Yeah, correct. Certainly, story was not out of everyday life. But atleast Rani's overall character was really authentic. It was as close to reality as it could get. Off topic, but I feel that the reason we like such real life stories is because there are very few such kind of films made. Suppose the situation was opposite, with more such movies coming out compared to masala ones. Then, I feel we would appreciate those few masala movies in that scenario. Human nature I guess. Just a hypothesis, but highly unlikely because masala movies will always get majority of the viewers and hence majority of the movies will be typical masala only. May be, we should ask some typical Iranian, because as per my understanding, most of their movies are close to reality.@Kapil I have wondered about that too. Would I like an Udaan if there were other films like it around? It'd be good problem to have though ;)Meanwhile, I have asked an Iranian woman what her thoughts her. Let's see what she has to say. :DWe didn't like it as much as you did, Meetu - actually, between  Ayushman Khurana snooty a'hole of a Male Lead and Rishi Kapoor's overprotective to the point of sadism Father, the only person we liked in the entire movie was Sonam Kapoor! It was a nice change seeing her play a level-headed young woman who really loves both her fiancé and her Dad, but won't let either of them push her around. We didn't make it more than a half-hour into the movie, that's how irritating the main men both were.@TimELiebe ummm...i did not like it either. The rating is "Watch if you have nothing better to do"@Meetu - true enough, you did. We really REALLY didn't like it, though - which I guess is one of those "Did it stink - or did it really stink?" kind of things. :)@TimELiebe I surrender. :PCopyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
