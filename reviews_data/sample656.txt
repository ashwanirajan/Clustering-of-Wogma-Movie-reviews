wogma rating: Watch if you have nothing better to do (?)
An almost 3-hour long, slick chase sequence that gets exasperating by the end. The climax itself is first unintentionally hilarious and then infuriating. A suave hero you couldn't care for, a pretty damsel-in-distress who exists only to add stress to the hero's life and ours - this situation saved by a brilliant (albeit choppy) background score and a couple of uber-cool action sequences. And you want to answer "James Bond"! as the voiceover educates you about the protagonist. 
But, I didn't remember any "Bond" feel while watching the first trailer of Agent Vinod. In fact, I was appropriately thrilled by how the trailer gave nothing away and yet piqued interest. Right from Kareena Kapoor's misshaped face in close up captured by a wide-angle, to the theme music. 
 
The second trailer though which has the above mentioned voiceover, had a thick "Bond" edge to it and you marvel more at the above trailer for resisting, "Vinod, Agent Vinod" as one of Saif Ali Khan's names - whatever he might say to deny it, it was promptly contradicted in the same video. 
Thankfully though, it looks like a good enough thriller. Even if it has the said feel, it doesn't come across as wannabe at all. Not to mention the "9 countries looking for him" part also gives it a heavy, very Indian, Don feel too!
Anyway, when we watch writer/director, Sriram Raghavan's work, we are looking for the mind-twisting and engaging content along with some class styling. The smart dialogue serves as the right start. And I am so glad it is sparse in the promos, that leaves more for the actual film. 
The only hitch then is, the music. The way the songs are picturized (there is a lip-sync even!) tell you that Raghavan has departed from his own style. I had loved the way the songs were done in Johnny Gaddar. Here, the fusion of mujra, Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan style music and bits of the Don theme sound really cool, but I am wary of how it'll impact the flow of the film. Similarly, I am hoping against hope that 'pungi' won't be a part of the movie itself. Imagine a suave Pierce Brosnan breaking into dance, even if it is only to distract the surveillance security!

Further anxiety builds as I see Saif-Kareena chemistry build or I here notes from 'ra ra rasputin' mixed with Serbian folk even if it is done really well and the setting is the most stunning combination of color and lights. I just don't want the story to suffer or me to be distracted from it for a minute in a Sriram Raghavan product. While I get my anxiousness in control, I just think I'll go have another whiff of Ek Hasina Thi...

  How often have you seen the Indian audience bank their hopes on the director instead of the stars? From my parents to my readers, the voices have turned excited as soon as they realized Agent Vinod is by the Johnny Gaddar guy. And it's not like the stars Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor are disliked or scoffed at. Hence, you resist the disappointment with the director/writer as you jeer, mock-cheer, tch-tch-tch and ultimately slap your forehead in despair as Agent Vinod progresses towards regression. You can sense director, Sriram Raghavan's discomfort with the extra money - just like a person who is uneasy among hoity-toity, snotty people, would be at a page-3 event. 





(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});


For all you know,  Raghavan's original story, like his earlier ones, might have been set between Mumbai, Pune, Goa and Delhi. But, well, what would he do with all the extra money? So, let's make the RDX into a nuclear bomb and voila, you have Morrocco, London, the works. We still have money left. Hmmm...songs, let's do songs. A lavish 'mujra' and a scintillating mix of color and light in a Gothic set should do the trick. 
Sure, you could call it the pressures of commercializing a product. But, I'd like to give  Raghavan a little more credit than that. I think he's smart enough to know that he doesn't need to commercialize his product. He is the brand. But, oh well. Who said an intelligent person has to be confident about handling money?
The sign that things might not be all right show from the first sequence. A quote from The Good, The Bad and The Ugly cuts into a scene which feels like it is right out of that film. Is it a spoof? Is it a tribute? No, it's a desert in Afghanistan. Should you smile at the reference, should you engage with a tortured RAW agent? Thankfully, this is soon followed by a slickly choreographed action sequence. 
But the confused genres show up again before you can feel reassured that you have some mind-blowing action to look forward to. Like any half-decent thriller, Agent Vinod fools you, leads you on, makes you feel smart about yourself by having characters smile that weird smile which tells you they are upto something, throws in your face a tattoo or a musical instrument-cum-weapon you ought to remember. But at each juncture, Agent Vinod leaves a loophole waiting to be answered. Whatever made sense, left the house at interval. 
The last 30 minutes feels like another film that started after the first one had the most ridiculous finish. The climax of this climax made me angry. Did they even realize what they were implying an agent from India's intelligence agency did?! People who know nothing about national security would come up with a solution like this after being a few drinks down. 
That besides and saving a few wise-cracks, the writing had way too many distractions, be it story, screenplay or characters. For example, with every film referenced, from Don to the original Agent Vinod to Charlie Chaplin, you are taken away from the mystery Agent Vinod is trying to solve. So eager is Sriram Raghavan to make his reverent tributes that he didn't realize how they are deviating from the genre. (Oh, how I'd loved the way he paid his respect to Anand in Johnny Gaddar!)
Then, throughout the film, characters are introduced either to be killed or they turn out to be an undercover terrorist/agent. I'd love for a psychoanalyst to analyze Agent Vinod (Saif Ali Khan) - he's confused about a childhood memory; he switches between being an aware human with a gut-feeling and an insensitive man's man. But then, that would mean the psychoanalyst and I would be spending more time on the character than the writers. 
Similarly, Irma (Kareena Kapoor) is introduced as a doctor who is an aide to a terrorist but takes refuge as soon as she sees a capable man around. The way she became a pitiable woman at the drop of a hat, there was an instant when I doubted myself. I wondered whether I'd misunderstood that she was supposed to be either an international agent or a terrorist. 
The chemistry between the Agent Vinod and Irma was dropped down to pillow talk between Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor. No people, no need to get excited. It's the kind of pillow talk that can put you to bed. 
No single character has a stay long enough to make an impact or engage except for Adil Hussain who had an elegant terror about him. Ravi Kissen and Ram Kapoor had fun-type quirky characters, while Prem Chopra was an annoying caricature. For the kind of terrorist he is proposed to be, he seemed weirdly compliant. Others like B P Singh and Mariyam had too annoying an accent and delivery style to consider anything else. And there are a few blink-and-miss cameos too.
I realize that I'm tipping heavy on the story and characterization in an action film. But that has a lot to with this being a Sriram Raghavan product. I know he has a smart style of narrating his story, but what troubles me is that this is like any other action film, especially since you have a wide range of Hollywood franchises to choose from. Also, somehow when Agent Vinod does it, it doesn't look as real as a Bond, Hunt or Bourne. It might have to do with the impression that MI6 is more capable than RAW. 
Throughout the film, I marveled at the different sound that the film had and how my feet tapped to the background score continuously. But, did it add to the story's character? It felt like the background music was on a different trip altogether. Similarly, sure, the camerawork, editing and some of the action sequences were state-of-art but they seemed like a different department not necessarily congruent with the story. Parts added together, certainly. But did they make the film whole?
Again, the songs, 'Raabta' did a 'khoya khoya chand' from Shaitan. And I can't thank the decision-makers enough for not having 'Pungi' as a part of the film, but I'd have liked to say nicer things about what they did do rather than what they didn't.

For example, with every film referenced, from Don to the original Agent Vinod to Charlie Chaplin, you are taken away from the mystery Agent Vinod is trying to solve. So eager is Sriram Raghavan to make his reverent tributes that he didn't realize how they are deviating from the genre. (Oh, how I'd loved the way he paid his respect to Anand in Johnny Gaddar!)
Then, throughout the film, characters are introduced either to be killed or they turn out to be an undercover terrorist/agent. I'd love for a psychoanalyst to analyze Agent Vinod (Saif Ali Khan) - he's confused about a childhood memory; he switches between being an aware human with a gut-feeling and an insensitive man's man. But then, that would mean the psychoanalyst and I would be spending more time on the character than the writers. 
Similarly, Irma (Kareena Kapoor) is introduced as a doctor who is an aide to a terrorist but takes refuge as soon as she sees a capable man around. The way she became a pitiable woman at the drop of a hat, there was an instant when I doubted myself. I wondered whether I'd misunderstood that she was supposed to be either an international agent or a terrorist. 
The chemistry between the Agent Vinod and Irma was dropped down to pillow talk between Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor. No people, no need to get excited. It's the kind of pillow talk that can put you to bed. 
No single character has a stay long enough to make an impact or engage except for Adil Hussain who had an elegant terror about him. Ravi Kissen and Ram Kapoor had fun-type quirky characters, while Prem Chopra was an annoying caricature. For the kind of terrorist he is proposed to be, he seemed weirdly compliant. Others like B P Singh and Mariyam had too annoying an accent and delivery style to consider anything else. And there are a few blink-and-miss cameos too.
I realize that I'm tipping heavy on the story and characterization in an action film. But that has a lot to with this being a Sriram Raghavan product. I know he has a smart style of narrating his story, but what troubles me is that this is like any other action film, especially since you have a wide range of Hollywood franchises to choose from. Also, somehow when Agent Vinod does it, it doesn't look as real as a Bond, Hunt or Bourne. It might have to do with the impression that MI6 is more capable than RAW. 
Throughout the film, I marveled at the different sound that the film had and how my feet tapped to the background score continuously. But, did it add to the story's character? It felt like the background music was on a different trip altogether. Similarly, sure, the camerawork, editing and some of the action sequences were state-of-art but they seemed like a different department not necessarily congruent with the story. Parts added together, certainly. But did they make the film whole?
Again, the songs, 'Raabta' did a 'khoya khoya chand' from Shaitan. And I can't thank the decision-makers enough for not having 'Pungi' as a part of the film, but I'd have liked to say nicer things about what they did do rather than what they didn't.

The last 30 minutes feels like another film that started after the first one had the most ridiculous finish. The climax of this climax made me angry. Did they even realize what they were implying an agent from India's intelligence agency did?! People who know nothing about national security would come up with a solution like this after being a few drinks down.

          Just watch Agent Vinod... First Half was sleek and catchi.. second half was dragging, lenthy. Unable to hold u to ur seat. I give 2.5 star..
        
SudhishKamath:
          Agent Vinod: Needs to find its footing between real & unreal, serious & fun, action & dialogue. Even MI is trying. Inconsistent but fun 6/10

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Agent Vinod finds a clue that is as open-ended as '242'. That's it. What is it? The people who want to get to it sound dangerous. Nuclear war type dangerous. Agent Vinod has to save the world.Agent Vinod finds a clue that is as open-ended as '242'. That's it. What is it? The people who want to get to it sound dangerous. Nuclear war type dangerous. Agent Vinod has to save the world.
After watching the film I loved the trailers even more than before because of how they mislead.
The titles - as with any Sriram Raghavan film!
The fact that 'Pungi' wasn't a part of the film.
The fact that they left Vinod's sexuality ambiguous. 
The auto-ride in Delhi.

Why did Kareena Kapoor smile at the interval?! It was surely no place for Irma to. 
How does the deonator get into that book?! 
Why doesn't Agent Vinod's boss not take a look into the contents of the USB stick he gets from the Colonel? And the Agent just takes it upon himself to take action. And such ridiculously controversial action at that!? 
Agent Vinod and Irma's backstories! Ugh!! What was that?
@Anuj :) *fingers crossed*Wait, wait, the Johny Gaddar guy is directing this! That changes my preconceived notions about this one. Might actually turn out to be good.@Rahul Yeepp! Johnny Gaddar and Ek Haseena ThiEk Haseena Thi as well! Now I have preconceived notions about this film being good.When you say Sriram Raghavana, I am reminded of not only Jhonny Gaddar but also Ek Haseena Thi. Unable to believe the film could be so bad. So much money had been poured into this. Also it took years to make.@Hariharan Ek Haseena Thi my parents haven't seen. We have to accept that as good as it was, it didn't get too far on word of mouth. @g-2 thanks. I'm glad you noticed :D But really :( for the film :(Gayi bhains paani mein!@Rahul tcha! I know...@g-2 ha ha ha. I had seen an interview on their official YouTube channel which (making of pungi, i think) which seemed to imply that it is a part of the film. Thus the relief. :DI was not expecting anything from this movie. I like few songs and thankfully I don't have to watch the movie for it.Meetu is it really and another let down, i haven't watched it . Actually i am a big fan of kareena and thus i can't miss to catch it in theatre.I don't want this film to be in the same league of Tashan and Kurbaan :(A few dialogues are a treat to the ears and throw in the much needed punch that lacks in the script.Meetu i finally watched the movie , i couldn't bear the amateurish script , irritating background and the quirky perfomance with needless characters coming in every now then. The movie is a wannable  bourne bond films if only a powerful script persits. Lastly i am being less impartial and add that we still want to see your movie KAREENA .nice and detailed. Few others reviews I had read also shared similar opinion@guddu oh well, next film... :D@Anuj maybe, hopefully not. :( Let's wait for more from him. @Bindu yeah, I hope so too. Everyone is allowed mistakes, right? Do watch 'Ek Hasina Thi' meanwhile.@Nishant, @Anurag wow! really? 'To each his own' at play as always.Boy Howdy, that was a thing that happened, wasn't it? I'm sure Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor had fun during their working vacation all over Europe, the Middle East and Southern Asia - too bad they didn't think to include a story that wasn't so full of character and plot holes that you could barely follow who was screwing over who. I'd say your review was spot-on, Meetu - this feels like a remake-in-name-only of a silly but enjoyable older movie, that exponentially piled on the silliness while losing many of its enjoyable qualities. Sure, it was fun watching Saif Ali Khan behaving like a goof - but it kind of made no sense that he did in the situations where he did. This was a case of the plot twists driving the characters, rather than the characters driving the plot twists. Next to this, the SRK Don looks like a model of thoughtful intelligence, and Tashan - well, Tashan looks like its Brother-in-Arms! Since "Illuminati Films" is Saif Ali Khan's production company (as I see from a quick Google search), I'm guessing it's he who loves all the Spaghetti Western riffs, whether they fit or not.@TimELiebe are you going to watch Go Goa Gone then?@Meetu - saw Goa Goa Gone on your recommendation,  and you were right, we loved it!@TimELiebe ;)Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.

Parental Guidance:


Violence: Loads and loads of it. Murders, bombs, gun-fights, fist-fights and the whole lot.
Language: Clean.
Nudity & Sexual content: Skimpily clad women and cleavage. One scene with an obnoxious man trying to get Kareena Kapoor in bed with him. But not too explicit.
Concept: Agent Vinod is chasing terrorist activity from around the world.
General Look and Feel: Bright and slick.
