
wogma rating: Watch if you have nothing better to do (?)
Run-of-the-mill revenge drama that tries very hard, but doesn't engage at all. Save for the actors, Bhoomi looks like other revenge drama, especially the very recent Mom. While I don't mind the action drama, there seems to be nothing spectacular that draws me to this one. I try my best not to pay attention to come-backs, because ultimately if a film is engaging, it is so – that an actor is making a come back would really have nothing to do with keeping me hooked. Let's hope it is at the very least better than mediocre. BHOOMI releases on 22 September, 2017Music Reviews:
Milliblog - "The diametrically opposite Kho diya and Trippy are Bhoomi’s musical highlights."   
    - meeta, a part of the audience
  Bhoomi is exactly what you expect. An over-dramatic story of a father and daughter who want to avenge the rape of the daughter. Right from when the film looks at establishing the adorably, loving bond that Bhoomi (Aditi Rao Hydari) and her father (Sanjay Dutt) share, it seems over-the-top. It never lets go of that tone and thus comes across as trying too hard and failing.The dialogue is extremely heavy-handed. Every line seems like it wants to make an impact. It is saved by decent delivery though. The entire cast lends its lines some credibility. But, the intention of the lines itself is to be loud and forceful. So, there is only so much the actors can do. Almost each one of them takes on a mode and sticks through it – that's just how the characters are written. Despite some great performers, the performances cater to the demand to be overbearing – overbearingly tearful, funny, sad, angry, disgusting and so on. The situations that make for the story are episodic and the over-arching story is unengaging. All its attempt to appeal to emotion seem hollow. This is despite being a topic that concerns and affects our day-to-day lives. It doesn't help that each of the situations is dragged on for a bit too long, especially the “drunken” scenes in the first few minutes. Unfortunately, the big reveal of the film is quite predictable. Except for the effort of the actors, there isn't anything going for Bhoomi. There are a couple of well conceptualised scenes, especially the one in the climax. But, one it is a little too dramatic too and it is of course very little, very late.

        ...All said and done, though, Dutt owns this movie, with every scene he’s in. Whether he’s getting sloshed with his best friend, Taj (an excellent if under-used Shekhar Suman) and trying to unsuccessfully hide it from his daughter, or denouncing the hypocrisies of Indian society in a local court, or just beating up the baddies, it is good to see Dutt on-screen again. And the beating up here is minimal; indeed, except for the last half hour, Dutt seethes and simmers, but keeps his anger and anguish in check. When he finally does explode, it’s short, brutal and violent, and a bunch of people die. Stay volcanic, Mr Dutt....

In that sense, this is much like a spectator sport — a ping pong of insults....

However, if you are a die-hard Sanjay Dutt fan, Bhoomi could very well make your weekend...

Movies like this reaffirm my concern that while attempting to magnify oft-neglected injustices in the society, they often normalise these atrocious acts by keeping the audience comfortably numb with their paint-by-numbers narratives. While I try to keep my flag of disdain for such material flying high, I am but mortal. Both my patience and anger will be drowned out by homogenised cinema sooner than later, and I will be but a bystander as irresponsible cash grabs like this one continue to live on long after the death of my sentiments....

Direction not upto d mark
        
RjHarshil:
          Just saw #Bhoomi very average film !! Baba na hote to is Bhoomi Ka kya hota. Performances are good story and direction have no spark.
        
pudiharicharan:
          #Bhoomi 2.5/5. Intense, hard-hitting but at the same time is a tad regressive. Strong comeback for #SanjayDutt. @aditiraohydari is terrific.

yasser_aks:
          #Bhoomi is a strong contender for the worst film of 2017. #SanjayDutts 'Mrityudata'. 
Terrific screen presence wasted by pathetic direction.
        
wittyghost_:
          With @BhoomiTheFilm , #SanjayDutt manages to prove his mettle, but the film is weak and boring overall. Full #Review

rmanish1:
          Worst, most irresponsible, perverse, cheap, loud, tonedeaf, brutally inconsiderate, over abundant, unrepentant film

          No offence. One of the worst of @duttsanjay #Bhoomi Sad.
He should be more careful in choosing future films.

          #BhoomiReview Outdated screenplay, cliched dialogues, and bad to worse direction makes #Bhoomi a very dull cinematic experience *1/2

          #bhoomi totally disappointed with this movie this is not the comeback i was expecting from machoman @duttsanjay  a very dull movie 
        
amitIJVerma:
          #sanjaydutt shouldn't act at all now. This the worse comeback ever. #Bhoomi is a self mocking film. @OmungKumar u should quit movies.
