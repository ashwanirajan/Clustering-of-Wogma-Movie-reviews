wogma rating: Add to 'must watch' list (?)
Slick action, though the super-moves might be unwarranted for the genre. About a flaw in our society, but completely hidden in the midst of the action. All negatives are completely overshadowed by the brilliant portrayal of the futile and toothless system that prevails in some parts of the country.Good news - Priyadarshan Priyadarshan has taken a sabbatical from comedies . 
Bad news - Aakrosh is about an issue that we as humans, can't be proud of. It tells us about the devilish nature humans adorn to 'protect' the God we believe in. It is about our need to control our environment to such an extent that we won't allow others' to control their own lives. It is based on honor killing, a concept that is not restricted to our country. 
Even if director, Priyadarshan reassures us that Aakrosh is an entertaining thriller and not 'reality cinema', a subject like this is difficult to digest; despite being aware of the Neanderthal behavior in this '21st century'. 
While one group of "humans" wants to control who a person falls in love with, another group of people decides what kind of cinema we should be exposed to. Yes, the censor boards was at it again. Aakrosh suffers its wrath because the language is too strong and it throws bad light on the CBI. Should we laugh or cry? 
Anyway, issue-based film and politics aside, I'm always excited to see  Ajay Devgn  in a serious role. Besides, Bipasha Basu is trying to turn a new leaf with every release. Whether or not it works, her bold steps - different kind of bold, of course ;) - are worth applause by themselves. 
Unfortunately, looks like Aakroshhas already lost the first battle. In the plethora of good music coming out these days, snoone's raving about Pritam's music, sample milliblog's music review.

  The foreplay between the religious, political, and administrative systems is sickening in some parts of the country. Nothing new. But every once in a while, a film comes that reminds you of that 7th page news item you dismissed with a nod of helplessness. Throughout Aakrosh you want to ask the question, "how can these local goons/politicians/police get away with it?" And every time the film reminds you of the horrifying nexus which barely shakes by something we commoners call "HUGE" scam.





(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});


We see the world of the deteriorated legal system in Bihar through the eyes of the CBI investigators played by Ajay Devgn and Akshay Khanna. They are frustrated and left aghast by the situation, and so are we as an audience. This is when the issue of "honor killing" is barely talked about. In fact, it's assumed that the audience knows what the issue is. The reason for the atrocities are more or less left to our imagination. So people expecting ruthless bigotry won't see that. But ruthlessness, they'll see for sure. This ambiguous justification might as well be intentional. The issue could be anything, the vulnerability of the powerless, is after all, the same. 
Only words like helpless and defenseless come to mind because as you see the massacre you wonder, "is fighting for the cause, however valid worth it?" Sure, t cause might be worth fight for. But when fighting for it ends up killing hopes and the people the hope belongs to, who is the fight for? 
The fact that I can just spend three paragraphs just discussing the issue says that Priyadarshan has hit the nail. The direction is smart and razor-sharp. The joy of seeing a director, with so many awful films to his name, make such brilliant camera decisions is inexpressible. Because of his guidance, I witnessed some of the best performances from actors I've always admired. 
Amongst the many villains of society, the policeman that Paresh Rawal plays is the one you want to see beaten to a pulp. Such emotion for an actor I look forward to watching - you can judge the power of his act. We've seen Ajay Devgn in similar roles, but you only want more, even if it's the same from him. True, his antics as Spiderman and James Bond do make you laugh. Though because it's all done well, the occasional 'whoa' does make an escape from your mouth. If only such action fit into the genre of social awakening. 
The rest of the cast do their bit, albeit not necessarily as impressively. Any non-actor could easily have played Akshaye Khanna and Bipasha Basu and we wouldn't know the difference. 
Also their characters aren't too detailed. While Bipasha Basu's character might serve the purpose of giving some backstory to other characters, Akshaye Khanna's character's only purpose seems to be to echo our thoughts, the thoughts of the city-bred audience.  A person to whom an explanation can be given, so that the audience's question is also answered. The other flaw in the writing is that there is no flow between scenes. The events all look too disjointed. 
While these things are somewhat acceptable, the songs and more so their abrupt placement in the film are just unforgivable. Not only are they obviously gratuitous, they completely ruin the build of the situation. This is also true of a few scenes where the pauses last a few seconds or the camera lingers longer than necessary. They make an otherwise well-paced film seem sluggish. 
Yet, it is well worth the buck because Aakrosh has some of the most well-shot chase sequences - on foot, cycles and cars. Meanwhile, the issue raised is something that is not talked about too often. Even if people aren't killed too often, there are far too many couples who have to either part ways/live a very difficult life because they belong to different caste/region/religion. Nothing to be proud of, but needs to be documented. Hopefully the future generations will be able to take pride in the fact that they have evolved as human beings.

          Please see the movie AAKROSH to understand the hard reality behind honour killings. There is no rule of law in most parts of India.
        
DNakshiwala:
          Watched #Aakrosh. Nice entertainer movie. @ajaydevgn is superb. You'll remember Gangajal and other such movies while watching it.

          watched aakrosh; its based on indias honour killing; was violent but true in nature; as usual ajay devgn rocked wth his persona !!!
        
Devarchit:
          #Aakrosh has powerful performances. Paresh Rawal once again proves he's the best in d business. Ajay, Akshaye r adroit.http://bit.ly/9NQDNL

          Just now back from noon show of "AAKROSH"..An average movie raising the issue of "HONOUR KILLING"..AJAY DEVGAN acted well..7/10 from me..!!!
        
coolnavnit:
          Watched Aakrosh, based on honour killing (recently in news 4 all wrong reasons). Ajay devgan once again delivers a power packed performance.

          Saw#aakrosh. Was a very disturbing movie. Top notch acting. Rips open the realities of the Indian villages which still suffer from castism.
        
chetanrathod:
          Why does priyadarshan put those ridiculous songs in a perfectly fine movie!! #aakrosh
        
carlos_anubis:
          Saw Aakrosh yest; rip'd off from Mississippi Burning [r.1988, set in the 60s], but scarier because it's set in the present and is relevant!
        
c4shiv:
          finished with two brilliant concept based movies - "Knock Out" and "Aakrosh".. Sanjay Dutt was ok but Ajay and Akshay khanna were better

          Aakrosh is another Priyadarshan feel good movie. Was expecting it 2 dig deeper in honor killing saga though. One time watch.

          Aakrosh(Ajay,Akshaye)[Rating: 54/100]A dark, gripping movie about casteism and honour killings. http://bit.ly/aymEww

CineManan:
          Aakrosh-on the slower side with not as hard-hitting a message as you'd expect. One time watch fare. Nothing special. 6/10
        
ChiragdevVerma:
          Watched Aakrosh..an average movie..starting was promising but priyadarshan could not keep up momento going...2.5/5 for dis one...
        
Ash_Arbale:
          #Aakrosh - Realistic, not bad.
#Knockout - Inspired but thrilling enough. Not bad at all!
        
ambudhia:
          Watched Aakrosh..Ok Ok kind of movie...
        
Abu125:
          Aakrosh is a noble effort and had potentials to be one helluva of crackling thriller but somehow misses on it. Paresh Rawal's simply awesome
        
_varun_vijay:
          Just saw film Aakrosh by Priyadarshan. It is a very poisonous film fueling inter-caste animosities. Copy of "Missisipi Burning".
        
why5o5eriou5:
          AAKROSH (2010) is PRIYADARSHAN's lethargic, overdrawn remake of MISSISSIPPI BURNING (1988) and AJAY DEVGN just can't carry this one through.
        
wadnikhil:
          Watched "Aakrosh" movie. Its a good movie.
        
Viveky:
          Director,What the fuck have you done.U screwed up d movie.Hv U ever been 2 north ever n saw how it is lived thr.Seems,U just heard. #aakrosh
        
vikramadhiman:
          In other news, I watched Aakrosh - a film set in Bihar, about honor killings. Noble intentions, lacklustre film. g
        
twishankyter:
          Aakrosh.... Priyadarshan tries to be Prakash Jha but in the end he is neither Former nor Later...:)
        
tanqeed:
          Aakrosh makes a mockery of the honor killing issue and the movie Mississippi Burning. http://www.tanqeed.com/movies/review.cfm?ireviewid=8

Swaplin:
          2day watched aakrosh it dissapointed me. I will go witi ** stars
        
svgan_in:
          Priyadharshan wants us to accept his comedy movies. Or else he will punish us with #Aakrosh type of movies... decide soon.
        
SaurabhBatham:
          Aakrosh the movie doesn't deserve the veteran like priyadarshan.
        
sandyism:
          Aakrosh shamelessy copies Mississippi Burning.Even retains the same nos.2 officers.3missing.Only fitting that MB dir is par ker(plagiarise)!

          Aakrosh-the movie......unbelieveable torture
        
RJAmar_Mantra:
          Knock Out nt only gt Knckd out itslf bt also took Aakrosh wid it..
        
Praksays:
          Aakrosh has moments of power but most of these are copied,The film’s tone is loud and inconsistent.
        
natlasreedhar:
          Aakrosh doesnt impress much...
        
manojmadhu23:
          Avoid Aakrosh.
        
Keshavsing:
          Saw Aakrosh yesterday ...the story was not new for me though ....n sometimes it felt like its hyperbolic (Atishayokti) , now bck to work.
        
iThermoman:
          Man is Aakrosh silly. Priyan Sir shows a dalit boy as dark skinned dehati and the upper caste girl as fair skinned. Sir, where is the story
        
DaveYagnesh:
          i have watched movie "Aakrosh" today. Its totally bakwas film. Priyadarshan now become master in directing bakwas movies.
        
ChInMaAy:
          Saw Aakrosh...but didn't like it..Priyan fails to live upto expectations....:(:(

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Two CBI officers are assigned to investigate the case of three boys who went missing in the hinterland. Anyone and everyone is involved in keeping the criminals away from being punished.Two CBI officers are assigned to investigate the case of three boys who went missing in the hinterland. Anyone and everyone is involved in keeping the criminals away from being punished.
The opening 'Ram Leela' sequence.
In scenes that has no background music, the ambient sound is captured beautifully. 

Wasn't this an official investigation? Why weren't the CBI officers housed in official quarters?
The background score is loudish and generic
The makeup of the women from the village. Their faces looked too clean and newly 'cleaned' to belong to women who are going through hardships.
The echo in Akshaye Khanna's voice in a few of the scenes.
The whole shool sena bit is half-baked.

Has Rayban struck some golden deal with all of Bollywood?!?!
Akshaye Khanna's stubble worked big time!
Inspired by: Mississippi BurningI want 2 watch this film simply because it deals with that issue...just like the powerless common men enjoyed the corrupt getting beaten up in the 70s & 80s, I'm going 2 enjoy those bigots getting beaten up...but as u know...it again has originality issues plotwise...it'll dilute the impact...I don't care about the music in such a film & it'll be better if the songs flop & get edited out....@Jitaditya you are right. songs are better-off absent in films like these. Originality issue - are you referring to Mississippi Burning?ya...Mississippi Burning is the buzz...although we'll know the extent of "influence" only after watching it...:DI think Ajay Devgan is trying to make a shift into different cinema that usual bollywood fans dont appreciate much but I like his approach. The movie itself could have had a better story with more realism in it.-Kay Latest in Bollywood I would sure like to see this movie as it has one of my fav. actors Ajay Devgan. He is once again in the government official role (Remember Gangajal?) so I am sure he will be greate.I like the colour coding for the external ratings.Does this film anything to do with same-name film by Govind Nihalani in 1980?@yves not that i know ofCopyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
