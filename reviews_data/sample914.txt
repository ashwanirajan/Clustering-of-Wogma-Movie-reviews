wogma rating: Watch if you have nothing better to do (?) - who can stop you if you love your khichdi, though
    
  Khichdi The Movie is so silly you HAVE to laugh. But that is only if you HAVE to watch it in the first place. And I don't see why anyone would want to do that. Khichadi The Movie shudder. 
I'm as much of a movie buff as I am a Indian-TV-show hater. Other than an one-off musical 'reality' show I tried to follow saw some 3 years ago, I have very little patience to handle the TV soaps on Indian telly. 127 seconds and I've had too much. I guess this is enough information about my television-watching habits for you to know that I have no clue what the 'comedy family ki family comedy' is all about. 
Unfair as it might be, the first words that formed themselves in my head when I first heard of the TV-show were "OH MY GAWWD! NO!!" (Yep, all caps and exclamations included.) Then this synopsis of the TV show raised my hopes a bit. After all, it mentions that one phrase that ropes me in blind - "gray characters". Also the producer is confident that, " It's not necessary to have seen the serial to enjoy the film." And this despite the characters already having a considerable fan following.
Anyway, all hopes were put to rest with -

All I can say now is "OH MY GAWWD! NO!!" - now in bold. 

    - meeta, a part of the audience

  When a film is so over-the-top and the situations are so exaggerated, I tend to look for the spoof in it; the underlying comment; the cynicism. And of course, left to imagination, it ain't too difficult to find it either. But, Khichdi is so crass, that even when I laughed, I felt yucky inside. It's not the toilet-humor kind of crass. It's absolutely (hopefully-miles-away-from-reality) insensitive crass.

I guess, it's their way of saying nothing is worth taking seriously - neither deaths and funerals nor weddings; and certainly not respect for the older generation let alone each human. And while they are at it, as is in vogue these days, a potshot at the media and the education system too. As if darker the joke, harder were the writers laughing at how seriously we treat the issue in real life. 
And thus, you can find social and philosophical commentary on almost everything - from asking the creator of the universe about the scarcity of water, to a human's love for creating problems for himself - a lot of ground is covered. And most of it using juvenile humor better known as PJs (poor jokes or more appropriately lame pun jokes). My affinity for such humor is obvious. In real-life and as an audience, they are all equally greeted with eye-roll after eye-roll. 
Yet I appreciated the fluidity of the situations. A film like this could very easily have been episodic. Even the most expensive 'comedy' films from India are episodic. But, Khichdi at least has some semblance of cause giving rise to an effect, rather than a backward calculation. 
Also, given the genre, I guess the lot of actors did a fine job of looking into the camera while acting! My palm was stuck to my forehead all through a scene in which the characters are giving each other acting lessons.
Aaaye-aaye-aaye-aay-aay. What will become of this universe? Someone please tell me, Khichdi's huge following on TV is a analogical poor joke.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.A family of weird people set out to create trouble for themselves. Good thing they know how to laugh at themselves.A family of weird people set out to create trouble for themselves. Good thing they know how to laugh at themselves.
Loved the kitchen anologies Himanshu makes.
For similar reasons, I loved the picturization of the 'chal, chal Bhosale market' song too.
The inner voice scene - another brilliantly done comic scene
Prafful bhai's hand gestures implying he's the smart one.
Names of the news channels

The dubbing is terribly off.
Farah Khan's role and that entire sequence.
SUCKS!AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE...OR LIKE DYSENTERY!thank god i got to know abt movie my hard earn money is saved......I would disagree with your rating because I belong to the category of people who loved "Khichadi" on television.Before going to the theatre I expected it to be just another episode, 4 times longer than on TV, and it met my expectations, maybe it exceeded them! I went to watch it in a theatre just because I did not want to watch Robot, nor a Priyanka Chopra movie.The reason Khichadi on TV got so famous was because the actors did a splendid job in getting into the characters they were playing... "jab Bhagwan akal ke laddoo baat rahe the, tab...bade loggggg bade log"Anyway :)@all for some reason i thought, this film going to get super-mixed reactions. Look's like that's how it is turning out to be. Looks like it has worked better for people who have followed the TV show, because it is their kind of humor and characters in the first place. And in the ultimate analysis their opinion counts the most because they are the target audiencei m gonna watch it .bcoz its funnyCopyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
