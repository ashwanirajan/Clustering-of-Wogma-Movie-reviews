  Bbuddah Hoga tera baap brazenly declares that this is a tribute to the legend and his prime years. Once you have done that, they could have gotten away with anything. They didn’t necessarily need a story or characterization. But they give you that and Amitabh Bachchan unlimited. Unfortunately, though the narration is falls flat every once in a while. And a tribute to the 70s-80s suffers from all the loopholes that a film from then had.I roll my eyes when I see the next Salman Khan or the next Akshay Kumar or even the next Shah Rukh Khan film being announced. (A little less exasperated with SRK films because they have some sort-of a story going around about them). But with the others, it is assumed that the audience who wants to see them in films doesn't want to see a story at all. It is very easy for me to do the eye-roll because I don't really care much for any of their acting skills. But when the STAR is someone you have admired for the last 30 years, or ever since you understood what films are all about. You sit back and give out a big "NO!!!" I mean look at this synopsis on the official site -  
Bbuddah Hoga Terra Baap marks the comeback of the Amitabh Bachchan…and he is angry!
He plays a retired hitman settled in Paris, who comes back to India to do ‘one last job’. 
Amitabh exudes the style and attitude of a flamboyant man, young at heart. The film is a fast paced action thriller which showcases him in a never seen before stylized avatar with action and masala of a true Bollywood film with the “Original Action Hero”! I want to see my "original action hero", and heaven knows how. But I want to see him as that hero not as himself in a film. If I want to see him, I have a host of advertisements, promotional material, reality shows, twitter, his blog to choose from.  So very tentatively, I check out the trailers. Well, there is some respite. It made me curious about his character and I want to know why he HAS to be so garish in the way he dresses - that is the character, not him. And this one actually made me smile in a "how sweet" kind-of-a-way -
  And maybe it's the "Grandfather" lable he now proudly wears, or maybe because he's my father's age, seeing him whistle at Raveen Tandon, brings a cringe. By the way, she is supposedly the item girl. I say "supposedly" because she is wearing clothes. From top to bottom, that too!  I would add that to the "cute" factor too. They must be onto something, if they could easily have chosen any of the Sheilas or Munnis, if not both, to do the deed. I'm just hoping they are onto a story. fingers crossed  Meanwhile, there is this one thing that Bbuddah hoga tera baap had given me that will make me keep my apprehensions at bay till July 1 - haal-e-dil. Thankfully, I successfully warded off Big B's retweets praising the song he sang. I listened to without any expectations. And boy! Was I bowled over. By the lyrics, the music and the lyrics. "cool ke to aap school hai, sirjee!" (that's a line from the title song of the film). And look what others have to say about the music.  Music reviews:
milliblog - "Heavy BigB overdose, but an entertaining soundtrack nevertheless!"music aloud - "7/10"Bollyspice - "3/5"Bollywood Hungama - "2/5"HappySing - "there is nothing much in the album except for the one Haal-e-dil"

  First things first (oh how I hate the phrase but, how important it is), T  bhabhi, please don't read this, go and enjoy your film. That goes for all Big B lovers. I am one too, so I know how much we want to like Bbuddah Hoga tera baap.

Reviewers like us will come and go, who want this, that and more in our films. But a persona like Amitabh Bachchan...
Bbuddah Hoga tera baap is an attempt to pay a tribute to him. Because there can be no justifiable words after those three dots, the film is underwhelming. For example, the songs had caught on, and you knew AB Sr. is going to groove to them. I don't know what you are expecting, but something that will surpass his cool act in Jumma Chumma, maybe? That's not to say he doesn't look suave in white and orange, with a printed scarf. Or that his moves aren't as charming as they were, back then. 
But then, you see both, the writer/director's passion and devotion to the man whose films we grew up with. You see he's hurt, that his idol has been sidelined to roles that say, "ol' man, you have passed your prime." Even if they are age-appropriate. He wants to revive that charisma, maybe, one last time. That I respect.
It's not like the film just showcases Amitabh Bachchan as  Amitabh Bachchan and has nothing more. Considering that the film is a blatant "star-centric" film, Bbuddah Hoga tera baap has a reasonably fleshed out story. The characters might not be very deeply thought out, but their motivations are clear. There are nuances that keep the film contemporary. Like the honesty about morals that were always deteriorated. He's not moralistic just because he's Amitabh Bachchan
But alongside are the references/tributes to films from the 70s. The parents who hate love stories; the hero who continues to be a hero despite taking on 3-4 bullets on the chest; the gratuitous song; a girl who plays hard to get. Some of these things work, some don't. Raveena Tandon as comic relief is annoying beyond measure, for example. 
Then again, there are those simple things that give joy just because they aren't there. Unlike some producers we know, you don't have this one making his presence felt in a now-mandatory end credit "item" song. When the songs actually had enough potential to do the job. It's a film by him, for him and of him, after all.
I liked Bbuddah Hoga tera baap because of Amitabh Bachcan. In a very vague way, I get Salmania. But I still use vague because, had it been an Ajooba or a Toofan, I'd have hated it. Thank you, Mr. Writer, for leaving in a story in there. But, I know you know, nothing can do justice to what Amitabh Bachchan symbolizes for at least three generations. Maybe it's time to tap how much more he's capable of. For your attempt, though, I applaud you, because I identify with your enthusiastic affection. 
So, here goes my attempt at a tribute. I could sit in one place and look at him, staring at a distance, humming 'Haal-e-dil' for an hour and a half and more. When he romanticizes Bombay, he combines two of my loves, and the delight it brings, makes me nostalgic about my affair with the city. When he flirts with girls less than half his age, he makes me cringe. Maybe because I see a baap in him. But soon enough, I forget that I'm seeing him, I see good ol' Viju charming his way - girls, women, police, villains, and all. Except, he can't reach out to the woman of his life. In that fleeting moment, his pain is evident, so are his arrogance, helplessness and resignation. When he kicks a villain's butt and 65+ year-old muscles move to some really complicated action choreography - without the help of a camera trick or an editor - I......oops, sorry, didn't mean to call him bbuddah! Can I get away with, "Sir, I wanted to see more, much much more"

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.now i NEED to know how you liked the film. When are you going to watch it?@Vishal that's a hilarious comparison. I'm thinking of giving up on notepad section.Hmmm... Harsh thanks for the vote of confidence. Will re-think, but seriously, I don't have the energy for it after having watched and reviewed 2-3 movies in a day. And I started feeling I wasn't doing the idea justice by doing a quick/shabby note. Sorry, but will surely think about it.Ok Harsh, will try and restart. It might just be a question of one extra cup of coffee in the system :DFew films have come to pay tribute to Amitabh Bachhan, and many more to pay tribute to the 1970s style of film making (come to think of it: no tributes to the 1960s film style).This one is an absolute masala entertainer.  The word masala being the say-it-all to excuse all logicless but still timepass situations.  If you are an Amitabh Bachchan fan and have queued up to buy first week show tickets for Sholay, Deewar, Amar Akbar Anthony, Khoon Pasina, Hera Pheri, Don, Muqaddar Ka Sikander, .... then this film is god sent for you.  It is Amitabh reloaded in the vintage 1970s form of an angry (not so) young man - and with an attitude.  Call him an angry young man and he is alright, call him an angry old man and he flares up :-)As the 1970s AB films, Buddhha hoga .. is completely dominated by AB.  There is no scope for heroine(s) or sidekicks or character artists or villain.  From the word go till the end it is AB who rules.Full-on entertainment.  I could only terminate by quoting what Meeta wrote in her quick review of the film:If you are a Big B fan though, you'll enjoy it a lot more. quick review: Bbuddah Hoga tera baap brazenly declares that this is a tribute to the legend and his prime years. Once you have done that, they could have gotten away with anything. They didn’t necessarily need a story or characterization. But they give you that and Amitabh Bachchan unlimited.Well, several years later, but we saw it, Meeta - and, because it's Big B, we loved it. Most of us pardesi Americans in Syracuse haven't seen Amitabh Bachchan in his "Angry Young Man" days - okay, my kid brother and I have seen Amar Akbar Anthony, and I've seen Zanjeer and the original Don, but that's about it. But we got what we was supposed to be - though I think maybe we saw something a bit more valedictory in the movie and its portrayal of him as an older gentleman seemingly preparing to  go out in a blaze of glory. (I kept comparing it to Soderbergh's Terrence Stamp movie The Limey - only funnier.)Just so you know, this was our third movie this evening. The first was MAIN AUR MR. RIIGHT, which could have been an American Rom-Com (that's not a compliment!) and turned everybody off with its shallow, unsympathetic characters; Dashavatar, which I would have been happy to stick with since it's about the Avatars of Vishnu (which we know very little about), but everybody else went Thumbs-Down because it looks like "Something you'd see in Sunday School!"; and finally this.@TimELiebe Your group's appetite for Indian films is commendable!Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
