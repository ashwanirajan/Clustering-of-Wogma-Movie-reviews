
wogma rating: Watch if you have nothing better to do (?)
More or less what you expect with a little twist thrown in. Ok fine, a couple of genuine laughs too. Cheesy dialogue that goes with tacky romance, Rohit Shetty action and top it off with slapstick that was intolerable even in the 90s. Ok fine, the green screen look given to actual beautiful locations has gotten better, maybe.Why would I want to watch the film if I am so apprehensive about it? I have this hope that all these smart people, Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol, Rohit Shetty – they must know what they are doing. Maybe there is something that I am missing. In search of the missing then, I shall walk into the theater, hoping against hope that I won't have to write an apology letter to my brain later. Music Reviews:
Indicine - "4/5" 
Milliblog - "Dilwale’s music distills Bollywood in all its familiar glory." 
Music Aloud - "8/10"

  A little while into the film and I was wondering why the interval hasn't struck yet. That's usually not a good sign. Occasionally it can mean that so much has happened in the film. Naah, don't get your hopes up, it was the former.  Can't remember the last time I saw a film which started off with such a resounding vibe of “what else did you expect?” Toilet humor, racing cars, over-enthusiastic sound effects, and so on. Some time in the middle of the first half there is a slight upward trend with a couple of good laughs and an unexpected plot point. But, we quickly go back to what we were expecting and that's that.In more than one way, the story comes a full circle from where things started in 1995 with Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge, it does a double take too. Certainly, Dilwale has a lot more story than you'd expect in a Rohit Shetty film. 
Doesn't mean the details are any less predictable. Oh, I am exaggerating, the unpredictability lies in the fact that when you expect a song a fight sequence is thrown in. Also, having a story doesn't mean it isn't ridiculous either. It is and it makes you roll your eyes over and over. And when the story doesn't do that it is taken over by most of the dialogue. That or you snort or snore. The only relief then comes from a few lines that make you laugh. A few of those are just at the plain silliness of it all, a few because of the way Johnny Lever delivers them and a couple from Varun Dhawan's dialogue delivery. He actually tones the drama down quite a bit. Whether it is the director's call or his contribution is difficult to say. But those times of restraint come as a welcome relief from the background music's omnipresence and more. It is as if the score would feel guilty if the money spent on it didn't show. Kriti Sanon isn't anything out of the ordinary, could be because her character isn't either.Shah Rukh Khan-Kajol are completely devoid of chemistry in their scens together. Just like old times - he hams, she shrieks. I don't know if I'm sad that we know that he can “not ham” and she can “not shriek”. Irrespective of what happens later in the film, that might justify their behavior, that bit was quite unbearable to sit through. They make up for it a bit later with a lovely scene. Awkward sitautions in Hindi films usually go wrong just by exaggeration. Owing to the actors restrain in this particular scene, it turns into one which I will remember every time I think of the film. Which unfortunately, will not be too often. As I wrote the preview for Dilwale, I wondered why should I watch a film that I am so apprehensive about. And now I remember. Films like these were one of the reasons for me to start wogma. Films that are superhits, but I just didn't like. Films that ask me to keep my brain aside. Films that are loud and are proud of it. It was to raise my squeaky, little voice and register a protest. While watching it today, I remembered the other reason. In these films there would usually be something that I enjoyed. These moments would get masked by the negativity the film would invite by just being what it was. However, I didn't want to forget those moments and how a movie made me feel. With Dilwale the one tiny twist showed me a ray of hope that at least some attention is being paid to writing. A couple of genuine laughs took the bite away from the toilet humor the film began with. The one scene with awkward silence stuck. Other than these, the movie was everything I expected from it – yawn and cringe inducing. But hey, that's how little it takes to go from “Switch channels if it's on cable” to “Watch if you have nothing better to do”.

On the whole, SRK-Kajol lovers have to watch them on the silver screen. I'm sure I don't want to say to Srk's fans to watch this, because they will for sure. Others may find it slow and boring. But, definitely a one time watch in the theater....

        ...Varun overdoes it. SRK is hemmed in, Kajol tries too hard. Pankaj Tripathi, now what is an actor like that doing there? Only one having a good time is Sanjay Mishra. Also, just as an aside, SRK looks great in the stubbly avatar. He should stay unshaven forever.

        ...Technically, for all the money spent, the film’s mounting looks garish and tacky as if the filmmaker wants every color in every frame. The songs are so-so but picturized rather poorly and do little than bring the narrative to a grinding halt each time they come. The frantic camera movements, over-cut action sequences  and a loud, loud sound design coupled with a hugely overblown background score try their best to cover up a substance-less narrative but fail miserably.

: Movie is ok
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Happy New Year part 2?  At least looking at the promo that is the feeling that comes to mind.I have this hope that all these smart people, Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol, Rohit Shetty – they must know what they are doing. Maybe there is something that I am missing.Meetu - you're missing that you're not the audience for this kind of movie! It's a huge steaming pot of masala - to you, it just smells like a bunch of junky ingredients tossed in with some spices, and you've had it so many times already you'd just as soon pass this time.To me and my American friends, though? It smells yummy, and we can't wait to dig in! ;)@TimELiebe: you are more hooked to commercial Hindi films than Meetu it would seem. :-)Nothing wrong.  I am truly into commercial Hindi cinema too.typical SRK hater .i rate you and your reviews (-10) out of (+10)@Fan - I would be hard-pressed not to like them more than Meetu does! ;)I'd feel guiltier about being a non-Indian who enjoys "Bollywood" entertainers if I didn't honestly believe that entertainment is what bridges cultures, and shows us how much we all have in common under the surface. It's because of those stupid "superhits" Meetu dislikes so much that a growing number of Americans and English people get a glimpse into a culture that's barely understood in our countries, and so easily demonized (and lumped together!) by our politicians because of that. (Do you really think our Right-Wing front-runner, Donald Trump, has the slightest idea of the difference between Muslims, Hindus and Indian Christians?) Besides - I'm a movie lover, so I love me some great trash in any language! :DPS to @Fan: The great American film critic Pauline Kael once wrote an essay defending entertainment movies called "Art, Trash and the Movies", which was were I got "great trash" from. :)You can find an online copy of the essay at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-7rAevQaV0T9M3O8EY4wQywpaXGWeXIgSRlfJzR23UU/edit .Lead actors -2 & Music direction - 2?Dude I could have taken anything face straight but the above two ratings clearly states how biased your review is. :'D@TimELiebe : good posts.@Aditya: didn't understand your outburst against the review.  The wogma  rating for Dilwaale is in line with a majority of other reviews on the internet.I watched the film and I didn't enjoy it one bit. Can't figure out why.There was the signature Rohit Shetty houses in vibrant pastel colours.  There was the signature car chase and SUV crashes. There were two of my favourite comedians in the form of Johnny Lever and Sanjay Mishra.  Yet I was feeling sick every minute of the show. Kajol was mesmerising.  And that's the only good part. Varun Dhawan is capable of much better performance.  No clear reason as to why he agreed to play a sidekick to SRK. I guess the lack of a story and the absence of one central point of evil made the movie just go in all directions. The first weekend would see some good business due to advance bookings and the strong star cast. But beyond that i believe that the film will find it difficult to survive against the poor word of mouth and against Bajirao. So long. Got to run for the Bajirao show. Back again in 4 hours.Christmas without the godmen (Aamir Khan and Rajkumar Hirani) Lets see how these films go.Dilwale will go beyond Happy New Year and Chennai Express, if the WOM is similar to RNBDJ's then Dhoom 3 is the target.@Fan : Dilwale = HNY2 = CE3 = OSO4 = MHN5 = Baadshah6Short of words, have to congratulate team Bajirao Mastani, I still think Dilwale will show an Aashiqui 2 response at the box office. Watch out for week 3.Fan will struggle to cross 125 cr with good word of mouth.@ Ehinome : too early to comment on Fan's potential revenues.  But after the sharing of weekend with a biggie and losing out; SRK would be having nightmares already of trying to poach away Salman's Eid date. Even if Raees is good it'll have a tough time trying to stand out against Sultan.  Arrogance would finally finish him off commercially."I still think Dilwale will show an Aashiqui 2 response at the box office. Watch out for week 3." LOL...typically senseless remark from an SRK fanatic!Lol Ajay Devgan fan Himmatwala is a disaster huhuhuDilwale will beat Bajirao at the overseas, and worldwide box office making it a 2-1 win; so chill, life is a circle since Swades and Paheli SRK has not been in full form at the box office, afterall KKHH beat BMCM 17 years ago, the truth is Dhawan and his son lost both clashes. If Paan Singh Tomar 2 clashes with Dangal or Sultan even IIrrfan will get 400 cr while 50 year old Khan will get 25cr.@TimELiebe Fair enough.@aditya :)@Prashant to each his own.Lol...stammering con artist fanboys need medical treatment or shock therapy now![Comment deleted because article's author started to feel nauseated while reading it]Too many expectations but it couldn't gain my attentions.I do love romantic movies of SRK but,-Same that 100 years old story so anybody can predict what would happen after 10 mins.-Same that overacting of Varun Dhawan sucks.-The movie shouldn't be of 158 mins. Many people would have gone asleep.-At least, writers should show some creativity.145 cr lifetime finish. 75 cr distributor share as opposed to an all India distribution cost of 125 cr. The combined loss for all India distributors is close to 50 cr. Dilwale is a distribution FLOP all the way.Dilwale is an overseas blockbuster.Kya Picture hai yaar.
