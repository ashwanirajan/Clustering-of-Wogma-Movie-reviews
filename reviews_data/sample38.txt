Comedy, action, romance – An above average entertainer in each of those elements. But, put together it becomes just about average.For a film that starts with slapsticky toilet humor, A Gentleman recovers quickly with a couple good laughs, a tolerable-cute romance, and some slick action. Unfortunately, it goes back to regular action masala post-interval and loses the little charm it creates in the first hour. It was a pleasant surprise to see the writers tease the audience into saying “baah! predictable” and peek-a-booing a “gotchya!” There are some good action scenes too. I especially enjoyed the parking lot and shopping aisle scenes. There is a little honesty in the romance too. Interestingly, this romance felt relatively germane to the story compared to some of the cool stunts that were for the sake of cool action. After a bit, it truly became fitting in fights because they made the film look slick rather than being an integral part of the story.The story itself was weaved together in a very 90s-like fashion where all elements of entertainment are put together – comedy, romance, action – with each of these doing their bit in keeping you engaged. But, as a whole it loses steam. Interestingly again, a film full of any of these elements wouldn't have worked together either. They were entertaining in that dosage only. Anything more and it would drag. That points to the inherent weakness of not being able to convert an interesting-sounding core idea into a full-fledged feature length film. If any of these departments were strong by themselves, one wouldn't need the other elements as fillers. And even so, for a film that wants to showcase it's action and masala, A Gentleman does relatively well with its attempt at story.             Siddharth Malhotra does reasonably well as both Gaurav and Rishi. He has his own style of merging with his surrounding, whethere it is a dreary office meeting or a covert spy operation. This unfortunately, could also mean that if he doesn't evolve, he will loose screen presence. To elaborate, in the scenes with Jacqueline Fernandez, or for that matter even Hussain Dalal, they own the screen. And while Dalal is doing a good job of keeping a smile on your face, Fernandez isn't even trying too hard. Her diction reminded me of dubbed English films. You cringe at her dialogue delivery just like you'd cringe when you hear Matthew McConaughey speaking in Hindi. It is sad that she is still taking on these roles whereas almost every actress of her stature is doing at least some films that don't use women as pretty props. Instead she picks a role that is as redundant as a woman in many a Hollywood action film.Well, at least they picked and executed the action pieces well. If only, only they were enough to recommend a trip to the theaters for you. In that sense, it is a step down for this writer-directer duo.

        ...Conclusion: A Gentleman is a solid entertainer which is not like other illogical Bollywood commercial films because it is rooted in realism. It is also a funny movie without getting too much into slapstick humour. The story takes some time to get going and the action scenes can be quite prolonged but in the end the payoff is worth it for both the characters in the film and for the viewers. If you’re in the mood for some lighthearted fun, then A Gentleman should be right up your alley.

Even the lead actors just keep a straight face and go along with the script. And it works alright. Sidharth Malhotra gets to do everything you’d expect from a commercial hero. Six packs, workout routine, Ninjutsu inspired action, Chase’s, love making, it’s all packed in. Jacqueline handles the comedy, glamour and dancing. While Darshan Kumar plays the bad boy with elan. Smart writing and slick execution save this fickle film....

And as with the feeling the good old pinball game that came bundled from Windows 98 to Windows XP induced in me, this film would have been a consummate game changer if I saw it in my more innocent times. While I enjoy the nostalgic appeal of pinball, I play Triple-A games now, and the former is in no way going to measure up to that magnitude of quality of the latter.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Double role films have been a regular favorite of Bollywood producers and audiences.  And so having watched the trailer that seemed to bring your typical Action Jackson and Comedy of Errors type of film I settled in to watch the film.The initial look and feel is your typical Dharma flavoured candy floss of US life with a nerdy white shirt suited and tie wearing SUV driving and living the American dream male oriented film (watch Simran to get a real feel of your typical middle class Indian family home's interior).The movie, as expected from the trailer, moves into the life of the other dare devil guy's lifestyle.  And then the inevitable crossing of the 2 lives.A fast paced but pointless film.  You have seen this all before.  A hash of several such films from Bollywood and Hollywood.  Nothing remains in memory after the film ends.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
