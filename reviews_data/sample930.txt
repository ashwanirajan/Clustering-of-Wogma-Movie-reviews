Seriously, we need to become rebels against the people who have the courage to make such films. Get it? Rebel…courage…kranti…..yep! It’s as bad as that last contrived sentence and it gets worse like the explanation to the pun. And yes I’m that bored to ramble on like thisDid you know it’s a big bad world out there? Did you know our country is rotting because of the corruption and bureaucracy prevalent because of the rogue nexus between the politicians, police and the corporate world? Did you know that we are the ones who brought many of these people the power to take us for granted this way? Did you know the entire system takes away our innocence? 
Damn! You knew all of that?! Smart you… Ok, I got more…

Did you know that all of this can be compressed into two hours?  Did you know a fresh-on-the-block idealistic journalist can give you a 2 minute spiel and turn you into an activist? Did you know this journo can act so bad that she can put some of the best ramp-walkers-turned-into-actors a run for their money (AND she looks like she has never walked the ramp either or rather she better not have)? Did you know that she had competition in the ‘bad acting’ department from almost the entire rest of the cast? Did you know that the film actually had a couple of interesting ironies that I’m willing to bet were not intended by the makers? 
Did you know that I know that you are now tired of these questions you know the answers to? Did you know that it’s taking all the will power I can will out of myself to spend any more time and energy (forget the 23,000 paise I spent) on the movie by writing about it? Did you know I have given up on will power? 
Well, now you do…

Twitter reviews for this movie are not available.No readers have rated this movie yet.This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Huh? You still want to know. Ok-ok, it’s a clean movie, more or less. A couple of mildly objectionable stuff here and there.Get thi guys, Taran Adarsh actually says the movie has some good acting. :) When will these guys learn something about social media? Anyone with 500 rupees to spare per month can have their own site and give the real truth to the people!I commend your courage and enthusiasm to have watched this film and the patience to have sat through it. By the way, may I ask why the suicidal mission to begin with? :)This film's review exhausted me completely. By the way, do late-comers get featured here?@fatema, if you are referring to me, Fatema, these are just some of the things I do for my site. After all, I am... the Friday Freak.@Roy all i can say is to each his own :D@Fatema thanks for the appreciation. but i try my best to watch all films that come out in a decent theater at a decent time in Pune. It's only fair, i think.@Bollyfan i'm assuming you are talking about your review and not this one :P and yes latecomers are added on special request :D@Meetu : Yes...was talking about my review. Sorry if I conveyed something else...blame it on Krantiveer. And thanks for the late addition. :)@bollyfan Arre no apologies needed. Was just pulling a fast one.@moviebhakt can i please be allowed to skip the notepad section of movies that i could barely write a review for :DWhat do you thinks are the reasons for Krantiveer's failure?Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
