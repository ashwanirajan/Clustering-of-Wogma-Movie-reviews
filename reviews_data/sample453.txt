Yamla Pagla Deewana 2 is one of those rare films that made me wonder why it was made at all.I was puzzled beyond words, when this one was announced. Enough Said.Music Reviews:
Bollyspice - "2/5"
IBN Live - "2.5/5"
Milliblog - "A soundtrack akin to entering a drunk Punjabi wedding!"
    - meeta, a part of the audience
  You know what the word is about sequels? The one that they are worse than the first in the series. Well, we know what the verdict on Yamla Pagla Deewana was. All we can say is Yamla Pagla Deewana 2 stays true to the genre, "sequels".Okay maybe, the plot is a little more coherent that that of Yamla Pagla Deewana. But, that comparison is pretty much pointless considering Yamla Pagla Deewana didn't have a plot at all. The performances are the same brand of loud and over-the-top, good enough to once again make the actors look like fools prancing around. Once again, heart goes out for Anupam Kher and this time even Annu Kapoor who are reduced to doing such roles. Interestingly, Sunny Deol is the one who gives it his all and tries to pull the film along.As far as the action and comedy go, I have no clue who the action would excite and who would laugh at the jokes or get excited. There is always that element of laughing at, "so silly that you cannot but laugh" in films of this type. Fortunately or unfortunately, Yamla Pagla Deewana 2 has that element, but it wanes in about two and a half minutes. While watching the film, the only thing I was cringing at was the thought that there might be a Yamla Pagla Deewana 3. There is a Yamla Pagla Deewana 2, right? What is going to stop a third one from coming along? shudder

: If the first movie was barely a timepass, how good can THIS one be?

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Very apt. :)@Vishal :Dwhen will these people understand that some good punches & extraordinary action cant save ur movie if u have bad screenplay with no story....@Meetu:I quite enjoyed the first one...dunno what turned u off about that one! Haven't watched the sequel yet (nor do i intend to).@ANuJ first intallment was far better,,dont try this one@Anup and @Anuj you guys are far more generous than I am...@meetu- may be u r more harsh then we r ;-)Wow. This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Even the 1st part seems so much better in comparison...@Anup :D@Manik boy, can we say that again!Wait - YAMLA PAGLA DEEWANA has a sequel? I remember seeing the first one, and it was (at best!) a timepass. Okay, Sunny Deol's desi Chuck Norris act was cute, but most of the jokes were either too kiddie show slapstick or too "inside baseball" for us Westerners.Do my eyes deceive me, or does this one have a guy in an ape suit, too? That is never a good sign....@TimELiebe some times, such is the sadness of life.i like sunny but i din't watch movie but i will watch after some time i hope this movie will good thank to postAt least I didn't have to sit through the sequel, Meetu! And thanks to your taking one for us, now I will never have to....::bows:: Your Sacrifice Will Not Be In Vain.@TimELiebe Glad to be of service ;)Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
