
wogma rating: Watch if you have nothing better to do (?)
What you see (in the promos) is what you get. Over-the-top, no-head-nor-tail, senselessness served in the name of unpretentious cinema. Sure, many from the crowd around me were laughing, hooting, and whistling their hearts out. At what though, is beyond me.
No thanks, I'm very comfortable with my sense of humor.

No thanks, I'm very comfortable with my sense of humor. No one, (yes, including me), walks in to watch Yamla Pagla Deewana expecting an intense experience or a strong story line. Everyone is in there to have a good laugh, come out, and laugh that they laughed. And a scene or two that stick in the head, even after you are out, is a bonus. Even with my expectations being what they should be, I found very few funny or entertaining bits.

I'm talking of earthen pots pausing in mid-air in pseudo-Matrix fashion. Only to be lamely put away by Sunny Deol's "dhai kilo ka haath."  Creativity, element of surprise is not for this filmmaker. 
The actors, well, they do whatever Sunny Deol, Bobby Deol and (today's) Dharmendra can do. I was worried I wouldn't be able to hear the dialogue in the middle of all the hooting. But it wasn't a concern at all. The trio is louder beyond that. After all, it is supposedly a prerequisite for the genre. 
Kulraj Randhwa's role exists so there is some sort of coherence to the planned chaos that the film is. As usual, I was disheartened to see Anupam Kher do a role which demeans his talent.
The blatant disregard for the 'writing' department is so obvious that I cannot really complain about how the character establishment of Dharmendra and Bobby Deol as conmen had absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the film. And there are many such glaring disconnects. In between this mayhem, it was only a pleasure to listen to a few witty lines strewn across that brought that occasional smile. But that is way too little for a film that is just short of 3 hours.
Presenting nonsense is an art form. Watching the entire Deol family dance in one frame is not my idea of entertaining nonsense. Other than that, the action sequences and the stylization - the two other reasons why one would consider watching this film - are as lame as they could be. 
The interesting thing though is that whether you think the film is going to be - hardcore silly entertainment that you love or brainless torture of the senses - your expectations will be fulfilled. 

    - meeta, a part of the audience

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.A mother wants to run away to Canada with her two sons because she doesn't want her husband's (Dharmendra) conman ways to be followed by the kids. She manages to take only her older son because Dharmendra manages to kidnap one of his sons and turns him into a conman too. After being separated for 30 years, they are now trying to reunite.A mother wants to run away to Canada with her two sons because she doesn't want her husband's (Dharmendra) conman ways to be followed by the kids.

How does Sunny Deol know Kulraj's brothers want a NRI to be her groom?
Story of movie is a family drama of a man searching his family got separated from him. Sunny Deol is in the role of Paramveer Singh Dhillon, an honest man living with his mother, his Canadian wife Mary and two sons in Vancouver city of Canada. He is working as a loan recovery agent in a bank of Canada. His mother who is a typical Punjabi woman had decided to give divorce to her husband Dharam Singh (role played by Dharmendra ) because of their personal problems. But one night suddenly Dharam Singh took the younger son and disappeared.  In search of father and younger brother, Paramveer decided to go back to India.Both father and son live in Banaras and are the biggest fraud there. Dharam has good personality and a very stylish man and adored by women of his age. He does not believe in love. His son Gajodhar (played by Bobby Deol) has same habits like his father but gets easily nervous in the company of women.It will be great to find out that how this family comes together through comedy of errors.Music directors of the movie are Rahul Seth, Sandesh Shandilya and RDB and the lyrics are written by Irshad kamil and Rahul Seth.The concept was not nice.It was a nonsense comedy,although the acting genius did his best but still there is something else which the people are looking for now!Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
