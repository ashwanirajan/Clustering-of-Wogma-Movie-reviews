
wogma rating: Watch if you have nothing better to do (?)
A sincerely superficial film. Makes no attempt at making character motivations believable. A case of “believe it or leave it”. “Leave it”, it is then.

  Each of us has our own definition of love and don’t feel loved till that definition is satisfied - if I had to read value into the hotch-potch of a film I just saw, that would be it. Koroli (Tapsee Pannu) believes love is when one goes beyond thinking of themselves, it is love. Sumit (Saqib Saleem) love Koroli but has no qualms about loving himself too. If only, Dil Juunglee had even a little more substance than one definition winning over another, it would have been an average film, at least. It is a good start in the sense that both the definitions sound reasonable. However, not only is the culmination run-of-the-mill, but it also goes way too wrong with the details. To begin with, Dil Juunglee stays confused between wanting to keep things light (read slapsticky) and taking love seriously. Striking a balance between comedy and romance is hardly unachievable, but it doesn’t quite go right here. At one end you are shown in great detail Sumit’s career struggle and at another end, you have the most superficial business meetings imaginable headed by Koroli. I am not sure if a fat finger can be pointed towards sexism. In fact, I don’t think that is the issue. For, if the makers had given the writing that much thought, there would have been a reason to complain. Interestingly, I found some of the situations quite the opposite of casual sexism – where casual sexism is thrown around as in real life, but the character it is directed towards refuses to succumb to it. 
The lead pair infuses all their acting prowess into the film, but a weak script, weaker character sketches and the worst arcs allow only for so much. You are pretty much asked to believe what is going on rather than seeing the character through their thought processes. Also, save for Jay (Santosh Barmola) who is given a composed and controlled character, the side characters are all quite loud and unbearable. So, save for the lead pair’s performance, there isn’t much going for Dil Juunglee. And that we have seen a lot better from both of them. Yep, that’s too little.

        ...Taapsee as Koro is brilliant and effortless. She breathes the character and is extremely convincing as the incorrigible romantic who lives in a make-believe world. Her transition in the second half is equally commendable.

        ...Dil Junglee is an age-old story, told with a hundred stereotypes, none of which helps it. It is only Taapsee’s charming presence and Saqib’s earthiness that keep us entertained. Taapsee looks authentic in both the avatars that she dons in the film. Saqib, too, provides ample support with his realistic portrayal of a middle-class Delhi boy. In fact, almost all the actors — Saqib’s mom, his friend, Taapsee’s friend and his fiancée — make the film lively.

In some other scenes, it is sexist and in some rare scenes, it even encourages violence against women.

Saqib Saleem consistently manages the accent of an average Delhi munda but barely digs any deeper, while Nidhi Singh hits the right comic notes in her outlandish TV actor avatar. A final warning: carry ear plugs, this one gets unbearably sappy in the last 30 minutes.
