wogma rating: Beg or borrow, but do watch (?)
I am not a hockey fan and usually can just about tolerate Shah Rukh Khan. And yet, I enjoyed the movie thoroughly. Brilliant writing by Jaideep Sahni!!I am the target audience for this movie. Like many Indians, (as appropriately depicted in the movie) I am a run-a-minute person. So, any game that claims to be "exciting" when the final score is 1-0, interests me only so much. Top it off with a "Shah Rukh Khan is over-rated" attitude. You know the makers have played their cards right, if a person with such tastes was hooked to the movie through its entire length. Though the credit mainly goes to the sharp and focused writing, the casting needs special mention too. But that will have to wait...

This is Jaideep Sahni's movie all the way. The little unexpected things in the script make all the difference in an otherwise ordinary plot. In a movie about underdogs trying to achieve the impossible, you pretty much know where the story is going. It's the "how" you get there that counts and CHAKDE! INDIA scores (all pun intended!) at many levels. The obstacles that the characters encounter on the ride, and how they are overcome, keep you glued with enthusiasm till they reach their destination. And I am really glad they stuck to the hockey team and did not whine too much about the coach and his life.
The rhythmic ups and downs in the story are supported equally well by the crisp, witty dialogues and the you-are-smart-viewers silences.  The sub-episodes flow from one into another without being episodic. That the editors did their job well is also demonstrated by this remark I overheard on my way out of the movie, "The good thing about Hindi movies these days is that they are only two hours. 9.30 to 11.30 - nice movie". The movie had actually started at 9. If a movie felt 20% shorter than it was, the editing department has done their job really well. 
Oh yeah, casting...the first thing you do to sell an ideology is to get a popular actor on board. But, they went one step further. The whole team is perfectly cast. From the hockey team to the hockey association members - not one of them can be singled out for not fitting into the shoes of the character.  It is difficult to say whether the dialogues were written first or the actors were chosen first. 
Okay - I loved Shah Rukh Khan's acting! There - I said it. Done.  (Believe me - It wasn't remotely as easy for me to write this as it is to read it.) The smirks were conspicuous by their absence; there was only an occasional, unnecessarily long-paused sentence; no romantic lines delivered in half-whispers (thank goodness!); and - get this - no trade-marked raising of hands on the side as if he is waiting for me to hug him. Best of all, he shared the space with the girls without overshadowing them. No-no, it's not only things that he did not do. There are things that he did right too. He was very controlled in emoting frustration, happiness, anger, disbelief. Actually all this made me excuse the occasional "I am the King" attitude (Ray Ban, et al)...ahem...okay...now before I get a divorce notice in the comment space here, let's wrap this up here.
When the entire audience is rooting for a women's hockey team for 150 minutes straight, you know the movie has worked. The movie certainly achieved its aim of drawing attention to our national sport and especially to the plight of the women in this sport. It invoked the national spirit, made us whistle and cheer, clap hard, and laugh out loud. It was almost like we were in a stadium watching an actual game. The question, now, is - are we sensitized enough to do something about the situation? Meanwhile, like Shah Rukh's acting keep your expectations in control and enjoy the show.

: When the entire audience is rooting for a women's hockey team for 150 minutes straight, you know the
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.The Indian women's hockey team is in need of a coach. Kabir Khan (Shah Rukh Khan) is appointed as the coach. This underdog team is then trained to be able to play in the world championship. 
Sincerely, at most times I was too engrossed in the movie to notice or take notes on the little things. Will have more here, hopefully after a second viewing.
What Worked

The fluency and ease with which the characters are established, even the most insignificant characters are defined by a line or two given to them.
The stereotype of Indians not knowing much about people from other states was played out really well - reminded me of a similar stereotype about Americans.

What did not
Note: This section simply lists the things that I did not like in this movie. This is not the overall impression about this movie. Please read the full review here

All the public/mass media scenes depict hockey as this massively popular game. E.g., kids are shown playing hockey on the street. Now, come on, who are we kidding here?

Nitty-Gritty
This section lists things that I think are not important to the overall impact of the movie. In most cases, it could be explained away by something like, "we noticed the glitch after the scene was shot and there were schedule/budget issues and thus we could not re-shoot it". I like giving the makers the benefit of doubt, but I am amused nevertheless. Hopefully, they will tickle you too.

Why was Kabir Khan talking to himself outside the conference room of the Hockey Association?

Review - CHAKDE! INDIA...I am not a hockey fan and usually can just about tolerate Shah Rukh Khan. And yet, I enjoyed the movie thoroughly. Brilliant writing by Jaideep Sahni!! ...[...] is all praise for Chakde! India. I loved Shah Rukh Khan’s acting! There - I said it. Done.  (Believe me - It wasn’t [...]---> get this - no trade-marked raising of hands on the side as if he is waiting for me to hug himThat comes in every movie of his!! Very good review, will most probably watch this movie. Big Hockey fan btw so will be looking to see if they have made any errors :DThanks Prashanth! That "raising his hands", really gets to me, but I loved the way took a dig on himself in "Main Hoon Na".Oh, do watch the movie and let us know how accurately the technical details of the actual game were handled. I have a couple questions in that respect too.chakde india! is a beautiful film!!!!shah rukh khan has acted reallywell…specially when india won …how he controlled his tears ..n he showed his hapiness thru his eyes!!i m really happiiee …and all the girls have worked awesome too …its reallllyy inspiringand touching story …A must watch!!! Will be a hit...actually has to be a hit!!!Songs are good too...give you inspirations...reminds you, that yes - "Hockey is the national game of India and should not be forgotten"A must watch for every Indianchakde india! is a beautiful film!!!!shah rukh khan has acted reallywell…specially when india won …how he controlled his tears ..n he showed his hapiness thru his eyes!!i m really happiiee …and all the girls have worked awesome too …its reallllyy inspiringand touching story …A must watch!!! Will be a hit...actually has to be a hit!!!Songs are good too...give you inspirations...reminds you, that yes - "Hockey is the national game of India and should not be forgotten"A must watch for every IndianWhat I don't understand about the so called critics of Shah Rukh Khan is either they don't understand what action is, or they don't have the guts to accept that he is a brilliant, versatile actor.It occurs to me time and again that either they are so jealous that they cannot accept his evergrowing popularity globally or they don't have the knowledge and understanding of what is the meaning of a brilliant performance.I really don't agree with this reviewer about what he wrote about shah rukh khan.  ((eg: "trade-marked raising of hands on the side as if he is waiting for me to hug him etc.)).Even though he maintains that he liked shah rukh in Chak De,his comments about him are not appropriate.Good review ! I haven't seen this yet, but look forward to. Everyone gives this one a thumbs-up and SRK acts ? Makes it a must-watch.I loved this film ..It was one of the best films for SRK ..Hats of to the director for giving a good filmKAMYA, praveen and krishna, thanks for your feedback.Pratima, has there been an actor/director/artist whose work you have never really liked, but suddenly one movie and that person surprises you. Well, for me Shar Rukh Khan (SRK) is one such person and he has surprised me in Chakde!. Die-hard SRK fans should be ecstatic that even people who have not liked him, have liked him here.Thanks Deepa. Yeah, it is awesome that we have one more person in the industry who can perform despite having the "star" tag attached to his name. Rocky, what can I say...wrong timing? :)KAMYA, praveen and krishna, thanks for your feedback.Pratima, has there been an actor/director/artist whose work you have never really liked, but suddenly one movie and that person surprises you.
