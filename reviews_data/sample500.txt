Everyone annoyingly thinks and behaves like they own this district called Ghaziabad. Best you keep away from them. To do that stay away from the film, please.Looks like every actor wants to be either a mean machine police officer or a mean machine goon. And everyone who has not played either of them earlier has been pitted against each other in Zila Ghaziabad, while a few others get to do a repeat performance - Sanjay Dutt, Arshad Warsi, Vivek Oberoi. While nothing in the trailer makes you feel like it is going to be a different experience from say a Singham, Rowdy Rathore or Dabangg. Except that the three lead characters of Zila Ghaziabad put together might not have the fan following or personal charm(?) that a Salman Khan, an Akshay Kumar or even an Ajay Devgn has individually. Other than that you have the standard action that is too cool for itself, dialogue that is delivered with more force than it deserves and a helpful handing of item numbers. Item numbers are of course introduced to compensate for the absence of real roles of women in the film. The only hope then is that the story might turn out to be different from the ones we have seen so far. Don't worry, I'll stop kidding myself. Right now. Music Reviews:

  Zila Ghaziabad is a revenge drama that never should've been made. Just like Jayantabhai Ki Luv Story was a romance that never should've been made. Without an ounce of originality Zila Ghaziabad just seems like someone's fetish of watching two hours worth of action. Amidst this free-for-all shootout, it was hilarious then to see a bone being picked because a few of the goons wore fake police uniforms while shooting. Huh? That was the only objection that the keepers of law and order had? Other than that, there are maybe four or atmost five one-liners that might bring smiles, two of which would be innuendos. Almost every frame reeks of drama. And drama almost always means either loud background score or slow motion that goes on for a little more than would be needed to make the drama effective. But hey, what can you say, for this is a world where slo-mo defines the character who is  in focus - If he's being recorded in slo-mo means he is important, means along with other characters in the film, we should fear him.That is as deep as the writing goes. The three male leads could take each others' place or character and you wouldn't know. The women, calling them props would mean they had some significance in the film. Unless their role as being the one who is shot/kidnapped to get at another man, implies they have meaning in the life of the men or the film. With such a background then, do the men need to emote at all. And even if they try would it come across as anything but fake. Even so, you can see Paresh Rawal, Arshad Warsi and Ravi Kisen at least try. Sanjay Dutt and Vivek Oberoi on the other hand try to hard. The only interesting character then seems to be Fakeera (Sunil Grover) who plays Shakuni Mama in this supposed replay of Mahabharat. Just in case you miss the Mahabharat analogy you have a loud 'yada yada hi dharmasya' playing when Pritam Singh (Sajay Dutt) is in action. It's a different matter that any two sides waging war against each other with a cunning character could mean its trying to depict Mahabharat. So, to give that one a break you have Sanjay Dutt staring at a chess board and after much contemplation moving a pawn on the board as a first move! It doesn't end here, later you have two kings facing each other, two steps away from each other. Item numbers - two not one, cheesy one-liners, self-referencing jokes that's what makes up for the parts of  Zila Ghaziabad that aren't action. The action sequences itself are tedious almost in competition with the tiring drama.

: This is an awesome movie. Must watch!
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.I don't think anyone can like such action. Plus, this is no Salman or Akshay movie as well...I don't think this movie has any hope:)@Manik I agree!:)You have rightly put the flick to task. Just how much fuel movies like these add to the already raging inferno of crime is another serious concern.This is an awesome movie. Must watch!This is possibly one of the worst movies made recently in bollywood. If it was not Arshad Warsi, i would have never ever seen this type of a movie.I did some research and found that the director of this movie has made a few more movies like this which are hopeless and completely dumb.Vivek Oberoi is at dumbest in this movie i guess, i couldn't control my laughter when he entered flying on bike in last scene. It was the worst slow motion.. LOL!!Too many unnecessary characters. I was lucky i watched this at home and had the luxury to forward it at times.The dumbest action movie!Please treat yourself by overlooking this movie.The director is surely a novice. I wish Arshad Warsi never works in any dumb project like this again.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
