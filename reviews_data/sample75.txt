The usual greedy businessman-politician-police web against the hapless common man. However, if you don't know about the scam close to what's really happening in Punjab's sarso-de-khet1, you might want a peep in. On the one hand, yet again you have the common man finding himself stuck in the web of greed for power and money by the business-politics-law-order nexus. On the other hand you have yet another scary scam. On the one hand you have a scary scam you might not have heard of. On the other hand you have the regular story of a frustrated and disappointed common man taking on the system. Repeatedly, you may weigh one against the other but the Singham-usque take pulls the film down even as the scam, which brings a shudder down the spine, tries to pull it up. You cannot doubt the sincerity with which the writer/director take a shot at the issue of ground-chemical-induced cancer. It is one of those scams that you vaguely know of, but don't know the extent to which industry and agricultural pesticides have taken root. In fact, as Arjun Mishra (Arshad Warsi) is shaken up by events he unveils, you are too. Because you know this inhumanity is not fiction.The details though aren't entertained. Many plot points seem like convenient ways to push the drama to the two-hour mark of run-time. An instance of a person murdering someone on their own side rather than the ones in the opposition left me puzzled. Then there is some mumbo-jumbo about a secret chemical formula, the importance of which was unclear. These bits take away from the impact that the film could have had and make it seem long-drawn for a 110 minute film.Fortunately, we have performers who rarely let us down. Even, Rajesh Sharma who is usually made to ham and go over-the-top, delivers a relatively controlled performance. The film's digs at Bollywood's over-romanticisation of all things Punjab and all things idealistic too. But, then again it submits to the formula – a one-man stand against the system – that's the only solution we can seem to think of, even as we speak of issues that exist in real-life. But, I guess, there are no better ideas out there and this one seems to sell. Anyway, the one reason to look this one up is to get a peep into the eco-terrorism supposedly rampant in Punjab and hope against hope that it is only in Punjab. 1 The lush green-and-yellow mustard farms that Punjab is famous for and romanticised by popular Hindi films.

        ...Warsi reminds us of his 2005 Sehar. He doesn’t go overboard and underplays a sharp cop, a rarity in Hindi films. Shah displays a wide range which he has perfected over the years, and Dutta looks ruthless and ambitious as the corrupt CM. In between, Kelkar also throws in some punches.

        ...While there’s no faulting Irada’s intentions, the narrative is poorly crafted and clumsily executed. As much as it’s a treat to watch Shah and Warsi, the two song montages are irritants and the production values a big downer. Important issues are glossed over and exaggerated performances by Dutta and Rajesh Sharma (as Kelkar’s right hand man) add to the emotional disconnect. The surprise end is no surprise at all – a go-to twist used in several thrillers, including the recent Kahaani 2.

        ...That question is just a small part of the tragedy that is this new film. Punjab’s “Cancer Train” should be the subject of multiple Indian films and media reports. Little purpose is served though if you zero in on a crucial theme but do not breathe  life into it. Irada (meaning: intent) is an opportunity lost to draw mass attention to a pressing concern. What a waste!

For a film that had a subject as relevant as that of Udta Punjab, this movie turns out to be a major let down.

        ...Aparnaa Singh is unable to hold off the revelations until the last moment and as a result there’s little mystery in the telling. Parabjeet Walia spouting shayari at his book’s launch is revealing of the unaccomplished plotting that drives this film’s narrative forward. There’s purchase though in the eventual appeal to be more aware of such calamities waiting to happen—because of our own negligence regarding environment protection laws and their quasi implementation. While the film is interesting enough and a brave enough attempt it’s not something that plays out as memorable or compelling- and this despite the crusty performances of highly dependable actors like Divya Dutta and Naseeruddin Shah.

Rumana Molla, in her brief role, demonstrates her potential as an actor and does well in the emotionally charged scenes. Arshad Warsi seems to have lost his edge. His natural flair with comedy seems less spontaneous and barely effective. Sagarika Ghatge is compelling, even while the lines written for her keep her from delivering on her potential.
