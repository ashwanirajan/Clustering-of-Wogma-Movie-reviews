And here I thought pretending to have a story could help even a Sajid Khan movie. Anyone who has followed this blog for a reasonable amount of time can guess how much I am or am not looking forward to this one. But, honestly I am surprised that I am not looking forward to it. There was a time when I'd look forward to three times Saif Ali Khan or three times Riteish Deshmukh. Three times Ram Kapoor would be a bit much. But the problem is this put all together. More importantly, it looks like it is also promising three times Sajid Khan. Now, that I will never be ready for. The only thing I can appreciate about a film like this is that it is absolutely unashamed of itself. No pretensions, no inhibitions. We are what we are, a slapstick and proud of it! Watch out for the closing shot in the trailer. Other than that, even if it says what it is, it doesn't make it any more enjoyable. Even the two minute trailer. The threesome dressed in drag to induce laughter, silly pun that is extended and explained way beyond its short life. The music seems to be the typical do too. Let's just hope I have at least two good laughs from this one. Just two? Can you do that for me, Humshakals?

  You are not expecting intelligent cinema when you walk into a Sajid Khan film. That is a no-brainer. To be honest, I was pleasantly surprised as I saw some semblance of a story in the first hour. It made way too much sense (even if in a slapsticky kind of way) for a film that was made by the same person who made Housefull 2. It is insensitive at multiple levels, yet it is borderline "not as bad as I thought". And then of course, it goes into one bad sub-plot after another till you are sick and tired of it all. Why did Saif Ali Khan do this one? Is the money that good? Or for that matter Bipasha Basu. Her role is so tiny and most of the time that she's on screen she is relegated to second lead lady. Ram Kapoor is the best of the lot, but that's barely a compliment. Sure, Saif Ali Khan and Riteish Deshmukh do try to contort their faces in ways which made the theater laugh, but that seemed like child's play. Anyway, a change of genre for Riteish Deshmukh is long overdue, I'll hold off comment till Ek Villain. In this one though he does his usual stuff. When the lines are unengaging there is only so much you can do. Interestingly, you'd have thought that the film would rely heavily on one-liners and punch lines to get a laugh out of its audiences. But instead, the "comedy" came from the situations rather than a dialogue here or there. I must confess here, that this is my judgment from the way the viewers were reacting rather than my own response. My gut wrenched as the insults got heavier and heavier. I'm not talking about the assault on my intellect. But, about the insensitivity shown towards patients of mental asylums; towards gay people; towards obese people; towards midgets; towards men who dress like women and so on. What is it about these things that makes us laugh? Why is it funny? A mental hospital warden (not even a doctor!) dancing with electrical wires while giving an electrical shock to his patients! Really? That's not humor, that's sad. I understand, that not every thing needs to turn into an outrage and we should know how to laugh at ourselves and so on. And to complete the circle, Sajid Khan cracks a joke at his own film too. But I am not comfortable with poking fun at people's disabilities and/or appearances. Even watching it is not done. I guess I should only be thankful that the film keeps sexual and toilet humor under control. Though there are long scenes involving each one of them which made me cringe. I am not really expecting to enjoy a Sajid Khan film any time soon. But, is a little sensitivity too much to ask for from a filmmaker who has a reasonably wide reach? Does humor have to be at someone else's expense?

Because the writing just isn’t good enough. Khan and his writers think of terrific setups – parathas made with cocaine and vodka; a drug derived from various species of dogs; lines from film songs being recited as dialogue (jahaan koi aata jaata nahin…), an apoplectic Prince Charles venting in Hindi – and these gags should have exploded on screen, but the follow-through is so uninspired and lazy that it appears as if they didn’t know what to do with these ideas once they dreamt them up. We walk in expecting lowbrow comedy and all we get is low-rent filmmaking....

'Humshakals' is the ultimate no-go zone. Save your money, save your time but most importantly, save yourself and keep away from this one. If you still feel compelled, catch the repeat of the Humshakals team episode of 'Comedy Nights with Kapil'. Atleast, that won't feel like a punishment!...

Saif, Reitesh and Ram work hard at it, but fail to generate laughs. Even the setting of the so called story in UK, appears more opportune than meaningful. It’s Sajid Khan’s worst film yet, even worse than ‘Himmatwala’ which in retrospect appears bearable at least.

        ...The best part of the film was when the end credits rolled – not only had I survived another Sajid Khan film but the behind-the-scenes videos made for a fun watch. Though I am still wondering why the cast was in splits every now and then, it most definitely couldn’t have been the script or the dialogues. ...

          :
        
        ...Sajid Khan’s ‘Humshakals’ promised to be a much better product than his previous venture - ‘Himmatwala’. But sadly, ‘Humshakals’ will do severe damage to your understanding of comedy.
If you really don’t have much to do this weekend, try taking your kids for the movie to check if they succeed in finding humour in the film....

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Farah ki MA apne ghar wale ko kaun si chakki ka atta khilati hain? Ek ke baad ke yeh parivaar joh 'pathetic' filme deeti hai - ab toh aur badtaar film banane ki bhi jagah nahi hai. Manoj Kumar's Clerk seems a masterpiece in front of this series - Tees Maar Khan, Joker, Housefull 2, Himmatwala and Humshakals. Hame is Pagal parivar se koi bachao. Producers - Please spend that money in re-habilitating the Farah-Sajid-Shirish family to an mental asylum!!! Has anyone said that Dada Kodke made better movies than this!?As expected..another rubbish Sajid Khan movie. The sad thing is that this may actually turn out to be a huge hit...Direction: -∞    Story: -∞    Lead Actors: 1    Character Artists: -∞    Dialogues: -∞    Screenplay: -∞^∞    Music Director: 0.5    Lyrics: -∞@Meetu : Yes i'm back for a comment :P"But I am not comfortable with poking fun at people's disabilities and/or appearances. Even watching it is not done."~then why bother watching a Sajid Khan film when you already know that this moron relies on pungent smelling toilet humour of the worst kind to evoke laughs from his "target audience". The Housefull films were saved courtesy good music and Akshay's clownish acts. Unfortunately with Himmatwala and Humshakals, this prat is flogging a dead horse way too much. That this fatso is low on IQ & has got a pea sized brain is a known fact for 2 decades. But that even a low IQ retard can drop to this level is shocking. PS : For the mere statement that this is a tribute to the Kishore Kumar brand of humour, this jackass should be thrown into jail and barred from making 'H' films for the rest of his worthless stinking life!@Raj D : Either you forgot to add OSO & Jaaneman to that list or you're just an SRK/Salman fan :P@Raj D oh well, Dada Kondke had a huge following and looks like Sajid Khan does too.@Manik sad but true.@Suman ha ha ha ha ha@Anuj because I try to do my job. because i am almost always hopeful.Went to hospital... Doctor gave medicine i am never gonna #Hamshakals again i almost died with braincancer in theatre shajid this movie suits u well....Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
