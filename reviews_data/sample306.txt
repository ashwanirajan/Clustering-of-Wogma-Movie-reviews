A revenge saga that works so hard in trying to make you feel for the characters that it fails and you are left gaping at the screen in bewilderment for over two hours.At first instance, Ek Villain came across as [Darr], a dangerously obsessed stalker. But soon enough you realise the stalker is actually a serial killer. Other than Stoneman Murders I don't remember another Hindi serial killer film in recent times. As inappropriate as it sounds, that in itself is exciting. In fact, its been a while since we've seen a decent thriller. However, there are a couple things in the trailer itself that tell you not to get too excited. One, it gives away to much of the movie and thus too much of the thrill. My judgement is I already know what's going to happen in the film half way through the second half of the film. Two, though I appreciate Riteish Deshmukh playing a villain, I fear he might go a little overboard from what it looks like in the trailer. I hope I am proven wrong on both counts, and at the very least can look forward to good performances by the three lead actors.  Music Reviews:

  There's a serial killer on the loose who kills women ruthlessly and yet I am smiling for the things happening on screen are mildly amusing and hardly scary. With a hero that you hardly care for, a lead lady that is carved out to be too sweet to be true and a villain who hardly has a menacing strain in him, Ek Villain is a revenge saga that works so hard in trying to make you feel for the characters that it fails and you are left gaping at the screen in bewilderment for over two hours.The main culprit is too much backstory. Too much backstory about the lead characters and too much backstory about the villain. Serial killers are serial killers because they are serial killers. They don't really need a reason to be so. I know I have always been a fan of grey characters, but this one just doesn't work here. His reasons are not convincing, and thus only end up being a distraction from his "villainy". I was intrigued when the movie started with what looked like the climax. It is very difficult to pull off a thriller when the audience knows a lot of what happens. And difficult it stays, for Ek Villain. There is very little effort put into making the dynamics of how the situation reached the stage of this particular climax interesting. While the movie starts with a bang and a lot happens story-wise too, it reaches a lull soon enough.It is then left to the actors to keep things going. Of the lot, only Siddharth Malhotra with his limited range of expressions came across as closest to natural. Both Shraddha Kapoor and Riteish Deshmukh are trying too hard to be chirpy and villainous respectively, to be effective. You could say they tried to do their bit well, in terms of trying to perform. But cute turned shrill and annoying and villainous actually made me laugh more than once. Yet, I am glad Riteish Deshmukh tried something different from slapstick. Here's to more such attempts. The film is also very loud, in general, with almost one or the other character shouting under the guise of being full of life or full of anger. It doesn't help that the characters are voicing out their thought instead of showing them with action. We know a lot of the villain's characters from their own description of themselves to others, as a monologue.I don't even want to get into the logical gaps in the film. These are clearly things that the makers wanted to take the audience for granted about. Most of them are quick fixes to get from one situation to another. There is this slight sliver of story that might have worked had energies not been spent in making the story non-linear. The story had enough meat, even without the backstories, to make for a decent film. But, it just doesn't work out with the combination of the performances, the side-tracks the story takes, the songs and dances. Quirks like Kamaal R Khan's character are more irritating than anything else, though it does mean he played it well.  Yet, that doesn't make its inclusion an advantage for the film.Saying that this story had potential is giving it a little more credit than it deserves because a lot of it needed to be edited out rather than just changed. We'll continue to wait for a good thriller to come our way.

It is intense, dramatic but it gives an optimistic outlook that is missing from films of this genre. If you have not been to the theatre in a long time, go watch Ek Villain and give it a chance.

        ...Ek Villain is an indulgent affair that breaks down the boundaries of regular thriller. Mohit Suri has raised the bar with this film that is captivatingly shot and crisply edited. At 2 hours, 7 minutes, the film benefits from the inspired lucidity in writing and dialogues. But mostly, it is the unpredictable skin Sidharth and Riteish don in this film that pulls the carpet from under your feet. Their phenomenal performances remain the movie’s most enticing bit and the reason why I am going to watch this once again. Going with a 4/5, this is one heady film with the desired punch....

They’re interesting men who could have been so much more. Without that depth, Ek Villain is a reasonably entertaining but unmemorable film....

If you remove the music and actors from this film, it's a weak film with a lot of loopholes and stretchy moments. There was a curiosity attached to the film so as to who the actual villain in this movie is? Well, the mystery ends as the writers are the real villains who ruin a wonderful concept by adding the unwanted reasoning part, weak screenplay and lots of forced melodrama....

: best movie ever
This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Is it better than Transformer?This movie is poor rehash of I Saw the Devil. That was an excellent movie with such intensely choreographed action scenes that you can feel the pain of the protagonist. Siddharth and Riteish try hard but are let down by poor direction and tacky add on scenes. The music and lyrics are again extraordinary but poorly directed. If you havent seen the original you might find this movie novel, but for those who have seen the Korean classic, the only saving grace are the songs.Riteish Deshmukh - plays a serial killer? Abbu - how could you? ::sigh:: Can Shraddha Kapoor find a good movie to show her talent in, just once? I feel like she's got enough talent to be this generation's Kajol - only she hasn't found her DDLJ yet.Leaving aside the fact that its a rip off, not a bad watch at all. Displays Sid Malhotra is a new avatar altogether. No wonder the audience seems to be giving it a thumbs up!@Bharat : The fact is that there is hardly anyone who'd watch Korean films in this country. Ek Villain watched in isolation is not a bad watch at all. No wonder the audiences are giving it a thumbs up!great character of these movie and nice script and Riteish Deshmukh beautifull villain role in itDirection: 1    Story: 1.5    Lead Actors: 2    Character Artists: 0.5    Dialogues: 0.5    Screenplay: 0.5    Music Director: 2.5    Lyrics: 1Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
