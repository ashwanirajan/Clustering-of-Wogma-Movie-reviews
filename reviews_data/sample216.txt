wogma rating: Watch when on TV/online (?)
Trailer covers all the novelty of the plot. The rest is a regular coming-of-age cum love story masked under the garb of a sex comedy. Neither very funny, nor insightful. It is crass. It is blatant about being crass. And those two statements are a little unsettling because they could be made about Grand Masti too. Yet, there is something that tells you Hunterrr is more a (coming of age?) story about a boy (nymphomaniac?) rather than crass for the sake of being crass. Also, it looks a lot more real rather than over-the-top. A little too real? In the sense that, despite the names attached to it, especially the list of producers, Hunterrr's trailer brings a cringe and more.I do see myself walking in to the theater with some trepidation. Here's hoping, it is misplaced. Music Reviews:
Bollywood Hungama - "1/5" 
koimoi - "2/5"  
Milliblog - "Odd, medley’ish debut by Khamosh Shah." 
Music Aloud – "6.5/10"

  Hunterrr's sex comedy bit is just the garnishing. To make the dish look palatable and draw you into the theater. No wonder you don't see much more than what you've already seen in the trailers. So, those of us going in to see our sexual needs represented in a comic way will be disappointed because that bit you've already seen in the promos. Those of us going in for the story of a boy who grew up like us or the romance will see nothing new because you've seen it in some other film.And I have an inkling the writers were very aware of this. Only that can explain the back and forth in timelines. Usually, non-linearity is very intriguing and works brilliantly in building up to the climax. But, in Hunterrr after a point, I stopped caring. It didn't matter when Mandar dated which woman. Woman after woman till present day. He shows no disrespect to any woman but has his priorities right – and understandably so. It is ok for the emotional hook and identification with characters to be missing. But, here it is complete disinterest in how his life turns out or what events lead up to that. Also, the scenes where the audience is being twirled between imagination and reality get a little tedious. Except for some witty dialogue (most of which again you have seen in the trailer), the writing misses target.Protagonist Mandar (Gulshan Devaiah) is a guy on the street who is always looking out for women. Not to be confused with “watching out for women” – just in case the word 'protagonist' in the context of a Hindi film, threw you off. He's the guy who looks at women in a way that'd make women uncomfortable. But for some reason, none of the women he looks at in the film experience discomfort with his attention. I guess the player that he is, he knows his way around. If it were not for the performances, the novelty of Hunterrr would have died down very quickly turning it into a very sleazy affair. Gulshan Devaiah gives the creeps and goes shy in sync with the need of the scene. As a natural progression, there is a certain amount of tackiness in the way he approaches the women. But hey, if the women don't mind his overtures, you respect their choice and accept the events. Which in turn means that all the women are convincing. Radhika Apte has a certain ease with which she performs. You end up believing her reactions in the weirdest of situations (across films). Other than that, there are some social references in the film which are rather overt – from safe sex to child sex abuse or paternal abuse of girl child to our preference for the fair when it comes to the fairer gender and so on. These seem out of place because the film is otherwise very comfortable in its space of sex comedy. These other things kind of jump out as awkward in trying to prove that the film is more than what it is – a justification for sexual gestures and norms from groping to men befriending women with only one intention; it is all a part of growing up, you see. Fortunately for the film and unfortunately for real life, this explanation is how it is. Only some boys become men sooner rather than later. Sure, we do need films that talk about sexuality – both male and female. There is a lot of talk about representing the sexual needs of women in films. But, the sexual needs of men too aren't addressed other than in the context of rape. Hunterrr is fresh in that context. Beyond that though, it is a regular coming-of-age plus love story. Not very interesting once you get past the “different” part of the background.

        ...The music of this movie is appropriate. The lyrics are in perfect sync with the situation they’re depicting. The camera work is complementing of its voyeuristic setting. This is one very well conceived movie. If you’re sweating at the idea of a sexually charged movie that could offend you with its content, be rest assured that the visuals aren’t as graphic, the movie never gets vulgar. In fact, this movie subliminally depicts it’s provocative themes in the most tasteful manner. This is a must watch....

        ...Dum??? Well, this movie is a nonstop adult entertainer for all those who have a humorous mind. It's a high level quality stuff, which is very hard to be found in our Hindi cinema and will end up being a game changer in years to come. The family audiences and people with an orthodox mindset should stay miles away from this movie. Also, some might find the movie to be male centric, but nevertheless enjoy this exuberant journey of adulthood with your friends and like minded people....

          ‘Hunterrr’ was hilarious. Remembered how in the 90s learning to work on the typewriter was considered very sophisticated. Good movie!

          Hunterrr is a pretty decent movie. There are some absolute hilarious moments. Although the story suffers from a poor plot.

          Hunterrr is a great opportunity wasted by terrible filmmaking. It has some good moments but fails as a film.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Seems like you too are having your fingers crossed!! Here's hoping, that it'll be worth your time!!!@lost in confusion Yeah, I hope so too! :DDirection: 3    Story: 1.5    Lead Actors: 4    Character Artists: 2.5    Dialogues: 2    Screenplay: 1.5    Music Director: 2    Lyrics: 1Yeesh, Meetu! You know we won't be watching this - not the way we feel about the whole "rape culture" thing. OTOH, Tammy really really liked MARDAANI - because seeing Rani Mukherji as a cop taking on a sex trafficking ring and taking them down made her day. She also liked that the movie made the point this is a lot more common than people think, and included a Call to Action....I will catch it on torrents  , whose going to pay 250 for this no face value filma, @ Meetu I suggest u too save ur money, these days these films are availabe instaneously on torrent. :)@TimELiebe There is nothing related to rape in the film though.@guddu tsk tsk. I don't do torrent, not for movies that I can watch legally anyway.There is nothing related to rape in the film though.Oh, I thought you said there was in your review, Meetu - it sounded kind of appalling from your review, honestly.@TimELiebe "It sounded appalling" It as in the film or the reference to rape? The reference to rape in the review is about men's sexuality portrayed as rape in Hindi films, in general. As in, there is no healthy representation of men's sexuality either, let alone women's sexuality. Does that make more sense?That's...kind of what I thought you meant, Meetu - that whole what's "acceptable as men's sexuality in Hindi films", which is uncomfortably close to what used to be acceptable in Western movies (and real life!) as well.In your review you reflected exactly what I thought whilst watching the film:He's the guy who looks at women in a way that'd make women uncomfortable. But for some reason, none of the women he looks at in the film experience discomfort with his attention.Spot on.Novelty factor is mainly due to the ultra rarity of soft-soft-porn.  This could easily get classified in the softer of the soft porn.  There might not be skin show that is in soft porn, but otherwise the story content is just like that.  The coming of age is just a flimsy garb to package the whole product.  Even though I do agree that the performances were good.  But I still can't get over the fact that Mandar was literally staring in a vulgar way at every woman he liked, and those women never minded that kind of attention.  Too unrealistic.@Fan Thank you!@TimELiebe oh I see.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
