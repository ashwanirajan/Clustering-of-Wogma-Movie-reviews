A racy first half gives way to mundane not-so common man vs. system.Ghayal was the 'citizen vigilante against the system' film from way back then – 1990. I remember liking it as a 16 year old because it was different from the QSQTs and the MPKs of the time. Ghayal Once Again seems to have the drama, histrionics and anger seething out of its teeth once again. But, this time around I, and most of the audience, have grown up. Not only in terms of the likely target audience aging, but also in terms of the milennials having seen the story umpteen number of times in the newer films with current day “star”s. Is Sunny Deol appealing to the new audience of Bollywood? Maybe, no. Is Sunny Deol appealing to the bigger audience that lies in the heart of India? Maybe, yes.  Sunny Deol claims that this isn't a remake. It is today's system vs. today's common man. I hope this means it is more than adding words like Facebook and Twitter into its language. Even so, I hope it will kero-mama it's way into our hearts even if the music itself hasn't impressed. Music Reviews:

  It was pleasantly surprising start to the film. Characters being introduced seamlessly, story building up well. For once, I felt like the concept of how the story is told can really make an over-told story engaging. Alas, post-interval, the film nosedives faster than you can think.When I say it started well, it has a lot to do with what wasn't done. There were no typical voice-over type shortcuts; no extra emphasis on trying to explain the background. A little tacky with the mental-illness induced flashback and a few obvious lines that were there just so the audience knows what the characters already know. These were easily excusable considering the setup typical of a film like this was conspicuous by its absence. For example, when was the last time we had a villain who was aware of behavioral issues? When was the last time a child was applauded and the child reprimands her audience with “what's the big deal?” The performances too were quite restrained. I might be a tad more forgiving because I went in expecting a screaming Sunny Deol. Soha Ali Khan seems worn out but at least she is taking age in her stride. The villains, Narendra Jha and Abhilash Kumar play their parts as business tycoon and spoilt brat well. The four idealistic youngsters – Shivam Patil, Aanchal Munjal, Rishabh Arora and Daina Khan – are competent enough for you to be worried for them. However, the story writing doesn't support them in the second half. The film goes from being about the menace of the business-politic nexus to a personal story, rather abruptly. Also, all the focus on the main story, the long-long chase sequence is wrapped up all too quickly making you wonder what the fuss was all about. Speaking of which, the chase sequence (like the film) starts out engaging you completely making it a thriller worth its salt and then overstays its welcome. When the film ends though, you remember what you liked even though you are totally miffed with how it all ended. A lot of what you like has to do with what was avoided – like self-references, songs, romantic track and so on. Unfortunately, you can remember a film for what it is not, only so much.

        ...If you’ve seen your fill of action films over the years you’ll really be able to appreciate what Ghayal Once Again serves up in its two-hour runtime. The dramatic bits are inconsistent but even so, the film manages to impress. It’s shot nicely, it’s fast and it takes the right kind of approach to building on the legend of Sunny Deol and Ghayal.

Soha Ali Khan has a confused role. One does not know whether she is just a doctor to Ajay or if there is more to their relationship.

This makes the situations in which Ajay Mehra has been operating appear more realistic. Baring few shots, which appear like a work of an amateur, the VFX could have been better.

        ...Most of the supporting cast is just forgettable and so are the dialogues and characterizations. It’s the writing and the direction that is a let down. For someone who promised ‘never again’ after his disastrous debut as director, this comes as a curious turn. Even if he was disillusioned by his favorite directors and it made better economic sense while in production to shoulder all the key responsibilities himself in order to cut costs, this doesn’t appear to be a wise comeback as director. A fresh young and able director might have done wonders with the treatment –enough to give it a fresh new look. With Sunny, it’s just standard oft-repeated, antiquated and outdated rigueur, and that’s just not likely to be appealing in this day and age.

But that’s lung power, not performance. Looking at him, we see why Ghayal feels dated while the Bachchan vigilante movies still have the power to surprise us. After a while, it’s not the action – it’s the acting. Deol just cannot play emotional scenes convincingly. But at least he looks as if he can move mountains with a single hand, and that’s really what this film needs.

Some of the plot points written in to make the story creditable are amateurish, and there is generally a sense that this is not a film made by professionals.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review."Kero mama"????I thought that kero mama was from Arjun Pandit or similar sounding film from Sunny's first 3 movies in Bollywood; wherein he is part of a wayward friends' team.  Maybe I have got my Bollywood all mixed up :-(@Fan oh dear! oops. It is my Bollywood that is embarrassingly mixed up. 'kero mama' is not from *Ghayal*.KERO MAMA is from Sunny's 1985 super hit ARJUN. Arjun Pandit released in 1999 and was a dud :DI am a bog Sunny Deol fan but haven't expected this from him. At least he doesn't have that charm he used to have once.Ghayal was one of the 3 cult classics and box office super hits which saw Raj Santoshi collaborating with Sunny Deol. Ghayal was a box office blockbuster among the masses and a movie that capitulated Sunny to superstardom. Unfortunately Ghayal-2 is way too cliched and out of sync with the times. This movie might have worked well had it released about a decade and a half ago with Santoshi at the helm. As of now, it stands very little chance of recreating the magic of Ghayal.Ghayal Once Again review - it's the best gift he could give to his fans. This movie is better than recent Hindi action movies. He has worked very hard and tried to make a great action thriller. In chase sequences it's clear that that a lot of vfx elements are used. He has no songs so the speed of the film is well maintained. Overall 4 stars from my side. Story is better than Dabang and Dhoom3 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️nice blogAt first 15 minutes i got fed up, with sunny's direction.From cricket starts to politicians, everyone has praised this film. Whether it was Sachin Tendulker, Amir Khan or Arvind Kejriwal (well he likes every film he watches. So…….) – they all agree that Neerja is a film that one should not miss. But let’s not get carried away so soon. Let’s have an in-depth look at the movie Neerja and find out what it’s all about and whether it is really worth spending your hard earned money on the movie or not.Yet one more movie @Meeta where I think that i watched a different film than the one you have reviewed. The film that I watched was unbearable to the point that I abandoned my efforts after 50 minutes.  The only things that I was able to retain in those 50 minutes are(1) a massive hangover of the original Ghayal. Every few minutes a black and white reference to the original is made.  In that case i might as well watch the original. (2) Unreasonable efforts being made to justify why no sequel happened for 26 years.  In today's world, 5-10 minutes should be sufficient for a director to explain why we had not heard of the protagonist for 20+ years. That too without melodrama of some serious neurological conditions. (3) characters are being introduced in a long drawn way. And despite 50 minutes having gone by I still was unsure if all the characters had been introduced or not.It's a pity to watch Sunny Deol fall into such depths.  Probably a younger and more aligned with prevailing times director would have been a better choice.  But what's the use of crying over spilt milk.I guess I have a little too much respect, maybe a little more than necessary even, for the time, energy and money that the crew of 100s spend on a movie over months. I try to take as much positive as I possibly can.Great movie.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
