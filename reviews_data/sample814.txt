It's not bad just because Akshay Kumar does it. Slapstick is slapstick is slapstick - especially if it is distasteful. A fart won't be funny just because it’s a fart even if it is Om Puri's. Even our Pune roads are flatter than the lines, situations and the film in general. (That's not saying much, but even so!)I don't know what the filmmakers felt while making the film or even while watching the film in its entirety for the first time. Teen Thay Bhai was certainly embarrassing to watch. And this is despite the film being devoid of sexual humor. Just watching three great performers going from one unfunny gag into another is extremely uncomfortable.

You still remember Om Puri's brilliant performances despite some really awful scripts he's picked; Shreyas Talpade doesn't need to prove his comic timing anymore; and Deepak Dobriyal is someone who has graduated from smaller, indie films into a performer you look forward to, however tiny his role. And they have a perfectly funny situation laid out before them. They are 3 brothers who hate each other but are forced to spend time together. 
Unfortunately, the only few times you do laugh/smile is owing to the actors 'rising above' the script and lines they are handed. At other times, all you want to tell the makers is ok, we get the whole shirtless Salman mockery you are trying to pull, but it's not funny just because Dobriyal is doing it.
You know how any 'respectful' Hindi family film is going to end when it starts with hatred. And the writers try to show how we try to find someone to blame for our weaknesses, but it's too plain and too in-the-face, they try subtlety and then give up, just in case the audience doesn't 'get' it. Besides you cannot have a story with no ups and downs, just one flat tone that the audience can choose to ignore and doze off. And no, an irrelevant sub-plot involving foreigners and cops doesn't help!
Interesting though, the movie starts and maintains some very good production values. Especially the lighting. They used very low lighting and maintained grays and browns despite the genre of the film. But then flashbacks are uses as an excuse to go into a contrast in tone - loud colors, background music. They are also used as an excuse to infuse romance, song & dance, and drama in the plot. This change in ambiance is disorienting. But that's immaterial because it's not like brown/gray/low-light 'style' make the writing or the lame jokes better. 
I'm confused. What do I feel worse about? High-budget films without a story or low-budget, indie films produced by the likes of Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra paying no attention to the writing.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.Three brothers hate each other. They have avoided being with each other as much as they can but now they are forced to stay with each other for a couple of days.Three brothers hate each other. They have avoided being with each other as much as they can but now they are forced to stay with each other for a couple of days.
The mockery at obese girls not finding partners.
Eluding to Anand with 'shifting pain'
Shreyas Talpade's English. No, not funny.
Deepak Dobriyal's wig when his character is younger.
The whole paratha sub-plot. That's where the story went straight from bad to worst. 
Ouch! I've always wanted wogma to be a one-stop shop for movies that are available in India. Therefore, I have invited Arcopol to do reviews of movies that are available in India - DVD or in theaters. And I stick to Hindi movie reviews, the only time I have someone else do a Hindi movie review is when I'm on vacation (not even when I'm unwell :) )I will keep your feedback in mind. If I hear more complaints, I'll have to reconsider my decision.Oh and it'll be a difficult decision to make because I love Arcopol's reviws :)hey anon i guess you are the only one who don't like arcopol reviews.meetu don't listen to that guy,there are people who enjoy arcopol reviews on those classic filmaking especially myself.i really enjoyed reading the reviews of shoshine,song of the sparrows,y tu mama tambien,amelie etc.i am looking forward this week new dvd release review by arcopol.@guddu @Shashank thanks guys!

Parental Guidance:


Violence: Brothers hitting each other.
Language: clean-ish
Nudity & Sexual content: none, unless you count a shirtless Deepak Dobriyal offensive.
Concept: Blood relations are hard to kill (?)
General Look and Feel: A failed attempt at humor with dry but stylish cinematography.
