Two and a half hours of detachment. Not in a good way. The trailer starts of with juvenile boy humor almost making you close it down within the first 15 seconds. But, if you stick through it, it surprises you with some serious business, patriotism of some kind, no less. And Deepti Naval!Not to say that I expect the movie to be engaging or entertaining, just that it comes as a surprise in the trailer. It also looks like that is how the movie will be placed, start off with innuendos and move on to serious business.Some of the slower, more melodious songs are a pleasant surprise too. Who knows, maybe the movie will manage that too, surprise us.Music Reviews:Bollywood Life - "3.5/5"Bollyspice - "2.5/5"glamsham - "4/5"
    - meeta, a part of the audience
  For a person who watches at least two films a week in the theaters, including some really bad ones, I admit  it is difficult for films to get me hooked. But, hand-in-hand, it is equally difficult to keep me more than 100% detached from what's going on on screen. Even when my expectations are low, I am on the watch for something to like, something to enjoy. But Yaariyan, manages to even take that away from me. The screenplay is all over the place here. The only clarity it seems to have is that it knows not what to do with itself. It is almost like they used a trial and error method of sticking blocks of story together. That is especially sad considering the individual blocks of story are rather random in the first place. Picture this - Four pretty much good-for-nothing kids in college are picked up to defend the honor the college. Why? While you have given up on finding an answer to that, the principal of the college insists on giving reasons which might as well have not been given. So, they have to compete with some college school in Australia and jingoism follows. The competition continues to be pointless and the worst bit is absolutely disgusting sub-plots lengthen the runtime of the film.If I go about looking for a needle in the hay stack, I would say the only Rakul Preet came across as someone who might be a good actor if given a chance. She's sweet and has a fresh spontaneity about her that I'd like to see more of. And I say this with Deepti Naval and Gulshan Grover in the cast. Then you have a couple of songs the lyrics of which strike a chord, but why would you suffer a film for lyrics?Very rarely, do I say this about a film, but this once I have to - there go two and a half hours of my life. Especially considering the Pune International Film Festival is on. Sigh

@mohitraj: If you take your friend watch Yaariyan this weekend,
then your Yarri with him will be in danger as movie is so pathetic
        
AkkaBond:
          No #Yaariyan for me after reading the review. It's more of a Yawn-iyan it seems.

This page has additional observations, other than the ones noted in the main review.@Meetu: based on the trailer agree with you a 100%.  It does start of with puerile vulgar comedy, and continues with that for quite some time.  Continue further and you realise that the movie would veer away from juvenile matters to serious stuff like pride and patriotism.  Promising trailer, but too much vulgar content in a film with social patriotic message would just limit the film to young generation.  I always feel that mixing vulgar content with good content just puts away family audience from visiting the theatre.I expect this one to be a complete disaster,even dumber and more juvenile than SOTY! @Meetu : Are u fan of Yo Yo Honey Singh? :P@Fan hoping against hope...@Anuj huh?@MeetuMy condolences for the lost 150 minutes of your precious life..Thanks however for the review as it has saved 150 minutes of my life being wasted.Wonder what hypocritical feminists & worthless armchair activists who constantly accuse male film-makers of stereotyping women and portraying them as "objects of lust" in movies have to say about this film directed by Divya Khosla! As I'v always maintained,film-making is a business and box office the holy grail. Anything that sells will be exploited to the maximum. People looking for quality & content can either start producing films for free or switch to theatre and street plays!Whatever said and done,this movie despite being disliked by 80% of its viewers' will still end up being a plus equation for its investors. This is what we call smart planning and economics,something that the self obsessed Kashyap's,Bharadwaj's and Bhansali's can learn from!Yaariyan has done good business with a decent opening considering the fact that the movie had a cast of newcomers as well as a first time director. Its take guts to make a movie with newcomers. The last movie we have seen with newcomers was Student of the Year by Karan JoharRecently watched the movie Yaariyan,its seems your review tells the truth. Feeling sorry for missing the review before I've watched the movie.yaarian is very nice movie but specially Honey Singh song Blue Panni is very nice. I love this song.Awesome movie,I love this movie and also movies Song was great.Copyright © 2006 - 2016 - wogma.com.
