
You have to grant that Bang Bang delivers what it promises in the trailers. Lots of action, just about tolerable stunts, a bit of coochie-coo between the incredibly good-looking lead pair and lots of on-screen time for the two, individually and together - all of it pretty much mindless, with no attempt at creating any interest in the plot itself.





(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});


Some of the stunts do look cool, especially for those of us who are not exposed to enough Hollywood. That seems to be Bang Bang's first selling point - Bang Bang, the machine gun kind and not the other kind that the movie itself admits there isn't enough of. You have the works - bikes, cars, race cars even, choppers, boats, water skis and what not. You have Hrithik Roshan flying down buildings and cliffs and emerging up from the deep seas. But, you know they are there just for the sake of being there. More of the "cool" idea leading to its insertion in the film rather than the story requiring the creativity of the cool idea. 
Pretty much same goes for the film's second selling point - Hrithik Roshan and Katrina Kaif - the gorgeous looking people that they are, they supposedly don't require character devlopment, depth or even a half-decent story or even decent chemistry. Just the presense of the actors ought to keep the audience happy. For the sake of completeness, then I will mention the most obvious - their abdominal muscles certainly worked out more than the facial muscles. Body language? Baah! Who needs that when you have the body? Any attempt at injecting emotion then, seems farcical. 



Not that emotion has much of a place in this film. So what, if it's has patriotism at its chore and wants to be a revenge drama. You'd think there would be a little more room for good song and dance in a film like this, especially given Hrithink Roshan's presence. But that too is too much to ask for. Just in case, you are still wondering, the entire plot is pretty much pointless given the "twist" in the climax. 
Since the film then has no  more selling points, it resorts to blatant product placements so much so that after Krrish 3 now, I have started associating Hrithik Roshan with product placement. 
And yet, I can't completely put the film down. At least, true-blue action stunts are being attempted. They might not have been executed well, but hopefully it will get better with the next film or the next. Meanwhile, though this is meant for some other long weekend, one which has the film running on TV with the luxury of flipping channels.

        ...Overall, the film's wide release during the long holiday should definitely work in its favour. Add to that, the popular starcast of the film will ensure that the movie sails through comfortably at the box-office. Another plus point to BANG BANG is that it has the least opposition from HAIDER at the box-office. So, if you are looking high-octane action scenes, sleek visuals, melodious music and if you love masala movies, then BANG BANG should definitely be your pick for this extended weekend...

So did Danny Denzongpa, who can make the most senseless thing credible just by his presence. On that note, someone needs to tell Jaaved Jaaferi that moving your head like you woke up from the wrong side of the bed, doesn’t really make one look intense and evil. ...

of Hollywod film 'Knight and Day'. The movie lacks the excitement and entertaining factor required for such films and will still cash in over its brilliant marketing strategies and festive holidays attached to it. We cannot blame Hrithik for giving us a half baked film as he had mentioned earlier, only that 'Bang Bang' is on the lines of 'Dhoom 2', but we never knew it would be a line below it. Thus, on over all basis would re-term 'Bang Bang' as 'Bland Bland' version of 'Knight and Day'....

Parental Guidance:


Violence: Loads and loads of gun fights.
Language: Clean.
Nudity & Sexual content: One kiss. Lots of skin show by both Hrithik Roshan and Katrina Kaif
Concept: The Kohinoor is stolen and that is supposed to put some India-UK treaty at stake. Go figure.
General Look and Feel: An attempt at Hollywood-style action.
