
Like melodrama is to drama, Mission Istanbul is to pointless style. What with super-dangerous and mega-powerful villains walking like they are on a ramp, only waiting for the hero to get to them and start a fist fight. So what if only minutes ago, they had thousands of guns and gunmen at their disposal?

Initially it did feel like there was some hope from the story writer, because the plot seemed non-standard. But ultimately, it's just another power-maniac villain doing what he thinks is best to gain and maintain that power. The characters are like those in any typical action movie - the stereotypical hero, his partner and a bimbette. So, here we have these ingredients in the form of a wannabe smart-Alec, a pseudo geek and a cleavage.

Parental Guidance:


Violence: Very violent. A guerilla war, gore, visual grossness every once in a while. Fist fights, gun fire and bomb explosions are in plenty!
Sexual content: Nothing specific except for the ill-clad women in the songs.
Concept: Well, terrorism, power-hunger...
General Look and Feel: It's a hardcore fight-fight action flick.
