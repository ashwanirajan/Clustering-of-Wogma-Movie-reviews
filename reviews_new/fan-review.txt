
Are there any limits to obsession? You might mull over that, but the obsessed knows no boundaries and is okay with you 'not getting' it. In fact, that you don't get it, makes him an even greater 'obsessed' even if only in his eyes. Oh what am I going on about! I can talk about a Shah Rukh Khan film without mentioning him for only so long! However, this time the reasons are all good. This is one astounding performance, even if he is playing himself for a good part of the film. 





(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});


Let that register - Shah Rukh Khan plays himself, and yet, it doesn't get to you, doesn't annoy you. In fact, you empathize with the character despite his smugness.
Him as Gaurav Chandna though is a different level of act. From frame one you forget the actor and are intrigued-amused by the character. Of course, the prosthetics are amazing. But you are forced to admire the character who quickly morphs into his idol. And you smile at how the actor 'gotchya' because well, he is only playing himself!
I wouldn't be surprised if many of his self-proclaimed die-hard fans actually believed that they were getting a sneak peak into the real Shah Rukh Khan's life, especially in the first half of this film. The cooing by the two young ladies sitting by both my sides is certainly testimony enough for me. But hey, even if I wasn't cooing, I was in complete awe all through the first half too.
The story is sort-of predictable once you get a hang of the characters but the execution isn't what you'd expect. There is no lead lady, no romantic track and there are no song sequences. No romance and no songs in a Yash Raj-SRK union. And it is not certainly for want of situation - the characters are performing in award shows and weddings, for goodness sake. I don't mind songs in my films, but there is a time and place for that, which most mainstream cinema seems to forget. It is a bold commercial move to not serve the hardcore Bollywood fan their staple. 
In fact, there is a moment of contemplation. A pause for thought and consideration. The focus is on the two characters and the face off. Which as admirable as it is, gets a tad repetitive after a bit. The second half slacks with one chase sequence too many and there isn't much happening otherwise. That's not to take away anything from the first chase sequence. Camera gimmickry aside, the action choreography and conceptualisation of that chase sequence is worth a portion of the ticket price. So is some camera-framing in a scene or two. 
But then, post-interval the film gives way to run-of-the-mill roof-top and middle-of-busy-street chase sequences. Except for one scene with a lashing comment in a press conference, it is more of the same. Also, the things Gaurav does are rather predictable and thus not jolting enough. But then again, that is a comment on how fickle star image is. Media, fans, haters alike don't stop a second and consider, “Could this celebrity have behaved this way?”
Then we have the borderline sermonisation. It actually reminded me of Shah Rukh Khan's publicity appearance in the pre-match (IPL) show. He was introduced to who the show producers thought was his biggest fan. He gets a 100kg cake every year on Shah Rukh's birthday and books the whole theater to take his friends and family for every Shah Rukh film. And yet, Shah Rukh Khan the actor seemed a little awkward. Maybe it was all an act or maybe it was genuine worry of meeting a real-life Gaurav Chandna.
Even if we think he is a little out there, does the fan in us identify a little with him? Of course, Gaurav Chandna clearly needs help. And thankfully not every fan is like that. We might not be an Aryan Khanna fan or even a Shah Rukh Khan fan, but we admire someone. We want to meet that someone. We won't go to 'any' extent to meet them, but what extent would we go to? Do the people who would go further than most others see a part of themselves in Gaurav Chandna? Do they say, “you won't 'get' it” to people who point that out to them? Do they get an insight into how crazy it is? 
For bringing these thoughts, maybe for not making me want to tear my hair out, for giving me 2+ hours of a solid performance, without taking anything away from the decent film that Fan is, even if I won't want to watch it again, I, a Shah-Rukh-non-fan would like to see more of this Shah Rukh. Maybe in a film that that will take our mind of his performance.

        ...Though Fan is far from being perfect, it urges us to think about issues relating to stardom, fandom, idolatry and public expectations from famous people without overtly appearing to do so. It is suspenseful without beating drums and clanging cymbals around its many twists and turns. Much of its appeal lies in the fact that the central characters are not stereotyped. Besides, when Shah Rukh Khan decides to go real and understated, it always makes for compelling viewing.

It takes a fresh concept and adds the right amount of zing to it. You could argue with the formulaic approach, but the usual thrills and spills don’t rob the story of its impact. Both the star and the fan have their grey shades. And that’s what makes Fan a smart film.

The film bears little resemblance to what audiences have come to expect from a Shah Rukh vehicle: There are no songs, no heroines romanced. It’s difficult to imagine what his fans, jabra or otherwise, will make of a film that spares neither them nor their hero. In the world of Fan, both parties are entitled to smash up each other’s worlds.

Like the fact that no one seems to be able to tell that Gaurav looks like Aryan. Perhaps the point is that the film is itself as much of a double-role player as its protagonist – one half meek and mild-mannered character-driven drama, the other a comic-booky superhero saga, one half an ode to the Shah Rukh of Chak De! India, the other a nod to his Chennai Express-es and Dilwale-s. But it remains a conceit, and the director cannot pull it off. The two halves never cohere, though the two Shah Rukhs certainly do. This is one of the actor’s finest hours. He’s terrific as Gaurav, and he’s even better as Aryan, a man who has everything, and whose ego will not allow him to apologise to a man who wants nothing more than a “sorry.” Who’s to say how much of Aryan is Shah Rukh not acting but being? After all, who better to play a super-entitled one-percent-er than a super-entitled one-percent-er?

        ...As this vengeful Gaurav, Shah Rukh Khan channels his own youthful avatar in films like Baazigar and Darr, The scenes are not too convincing, but they lead to the inevitable showdown. Khan plays the star with a kind of weary resignation, so his real challenge is to make Gaurav likeable, devious and tragic at the same time, and he does that brilliantly.  Shah Rukh Khan does not need to prove that he still has a true actor’s fire in his belly, but Fan does that anyway, even if that means no other actor in the film has much to do.

        ...Of nothing else, Fan demonstrates why SRK’s appeal is so enduring. Even in a film that has more than its share of flaws and loose ends, he can stitch together a performance that is both riveting and crowd-pleasing.

        ...Waluscha D'Souza has no role. Even when she is being terrorized by Gaurav in her own home, the camera shows the back of her head. Sayani Gupta as his PA is top notch adding weight to her character, simply by her presence.

        ...As I left the cinema having watched the film, I found myself conflicted about my feelings. There is so much to admire here, but it’s evident the filmmakers think they’ve made a smarter film than they actually have. Still, Fan works for the most part. And anyone who – like me – had grown tired and disappointed with Shah Rukh's unwillingness to step out of his comfort zone will have reason to be a fan again. I’m going with 3 out of 5.

        ...As a film, I found Fan to be short of drama. This was meant to be a thriller, but that edge of the seat buildup is missing. Much of it can be attributed to the lack in detailing of the story. This is not necessary a slip as much as a deliberate decision by the producers and the director to make the film in a specific way. But it had tremendous potential to be a darker, grittier film. Darr has a visceral impact that probably will never date. In making the movie an ‘entertainer’ for today’s times – which it is, no doubt – the makers may have lost the chance to make it timeless.As a film, I found Fan to be short of drama.

        ...The movie is neither a thriller nor a comedy with the only adorable bits coming from the parents of Gaurav with Deepika and Yogendra pulling off a good act. The screenplay has too many loopholes and shortcuts as the director desperately tried to preach what a fan should be and shouldn't be without really affecting SRK's fan base. He pretty much took the easy way out to show that a fan no matter how crazy he is, is still important. The sadness in SRK's eyes in the end as he waves to his fans in a way vindicated Gaurav's obsession and that was the movie's greatest compromise!
