
It is to the film’s credit that it manages to keep you hooked despite having one of the lamest starts a thriller could have, and being excruciatingly and unnecessarily slow a little too frequently. The broader story and its core message are interesting.
But for the details, logical gaps and and the speed at which they unfold take away from the film. 

                        … background music … through the film it has no intention of staying in the background and is in fact, trying too hard to get your attention.
                    
The audience is asked to make assumptions and accept what’s shown. This would have been fine because thrillers invariably have loopholes. However, decent thrillers jump through the logic at double speed giving you no time to think, unless you ponder over it later. Aiyaary chooses completely avoidable slow motion and long pauses for characters to stare into the distance. 
The story’s outer shell is about an army officer from a secret team who has gone rogue. At the core though, Aiyaari questions the system. This is hardly the first time that a thriller has asked these questions. But, I thought the manner in which Aiyyari frames this question is insightful and thought-provoking. So what if it is not going to last beyond the 2.5+ hours of the run-time.

Even the other details in the writing seem forced. For instance, the constant use of social media platforms in the dialogue, sounded like the writers wanted to come across as tech-savvy. And when a hacker mumbles aloud the steps she’s taking to show that she is an ace programmer, it just sounds ridiculous. 
I guess we should just be happy that women have actual jobs here. So what, if they leave it all at the drop of a hat, when the script so demands. The script has many such details that sound rather random and there are other spots where details are glaringly missing. 



What is left then is the overall story arch and that is a good hook. Despite the tardy pace, despite the slack in logic, despite the random details, the larger story is still engaging. While I enjoyed it, I couldn’t help but think how much better it could’ve been if it were 40 minutes shorter. 
Other than that, the actors all do the drill. The script doesn’t require anything extraordinary from anyone other than Naseeruddin Shah. And for all you know, it could just have been the actor who added that edge to his character. Siddharth Malhotra’s smile gets annoying in its attempt at being cryptic. Manoj Bajpai of course has essayed so many complex characters that this had to be a cakewalk for him. Such is the actor’s repertoire that his earnestness here seems only cute. 

                        Logical gaps and and the speed at which they unfold take away from the film.
                    
And then you have the background music that is effective only a couple of times. Otherwise, through the film it has no intention of staying in the background and is in fact, trying too hard to get your attention.
Here’s a parting thought. I remember A Wednesday as a crisp, quick film. I wondered if Neeraj Pandey’s films have started getting longer. So, I looked them up  and here is how it goes:

2008 A Wednesday 1 hour 44 minutes   
2013 Special Chabbis2 hours 24 minutes   
2015 Baby 2 hours 35 minutes   
2016 M S Dhoni – An Untold Story 3 hours 40 minutes   

Of course, the last one is an exception, but could it be that all these films could have been much better if they were cut short?

Aiyaary doesn’t shape shift or create interesting characters for itself. It remains one shapeless boring watch.
