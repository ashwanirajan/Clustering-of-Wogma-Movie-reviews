I love cinema that can be discussed like a Maths question paper after coming out of the examination hall. Where participants / viewers can compare mental notes. Questions like “What do you think happened to him?”, “Why did he do that?”, “Where did he come from?” It gives the film the much needed mind-space to exist beyond its stipulated running time.
