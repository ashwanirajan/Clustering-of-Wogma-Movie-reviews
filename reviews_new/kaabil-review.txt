
I am so tempted to repeat the first paragraph of the Raees review. It truly is heartening to see actors, who we associate with a certain type of cinema, do something slightly different. Just that bit is enough for me to not complain about them not breaking the mould completely. Kaabil might not be the best thriller out there, but it surely keeps you wondering, “HowHeDunnit”. And that bit doesn't disappoint.

                        Kaabil might not be the best thriller out there, but it surely keeps you wondering, “HowHeDunnit”.
                    
Kaabil reminded me a lot of  Aankhen. It had to, right? And I have this strong feeling that some plot points, if not all have been inspired from elsewhere. The tone of the film from the beginning kind of gives away how things are going to go with our hero. Also, the film spends a good half of the film on the couple but doesn't leave an emotional tug. These two things put together make Kaabil a little underwhelming.
Nevertheless, the curiosity about how it is done takes you through the film. Also, Hrithik Roshan  is angry and sad more than being all goody-goody. When he does the latter, it usually gets annoying in the first few minutes. This could be why Yami Gautam and he don't make your hearts go all mush despite capable execution by Yami Gautam. The aggressive bits, Hrithik Roshan does much better though and that works for Kaabil. Ronit Roy and Girish Kulkarni add to this intensity by being the bad men that they might soon be stereotyped as.

The songs jar and the item number thrown in for good measure distracts from the seriousness of the film. However, Sanjay Gupta does control himself in the editing and camerawork department. There are no unnecessary quirks or choppy cuts which add to the films intensity. 
While the dynamics of how the thrill is brought about are written well, the  main character's transition bothered me. On the other hand, it has always bothered me when films have a common man, who is disappointed by the system, take matters into his own hands. So, that would make me reject half the films in this genre, right?



In that sense then, Kaabil is a worthy watch. Despite all the ifs and buts.

        ...On the whole, KAABIL is gripping, gut-wrenching and is likely to stay with you for a long time. Now that DANGAL has almost exhausted its run at the ticket windows, the box-office is quiet and subdued and KAABIL should have no difficulty filling seats at cineplexes, despite a strong opponent releasing alongside. Rich in merits, this film has the power and potential to emerge a success story at the box-office. Highly recommended!

The actor who seems to have put all his heart and soul into the making of this riveting drama is worth the price of your tickets alone. While his earnest and hard worked performance compliments the tight script of the film, the straightforward yet seemingly outdated direction of the film by Sanjay Gupta keeps you thoroughly entertained. Kaabil is for viewers who don’t mind watching entertainers. Don't be surprised if the actor walks away with all major awards of the season next year.

With a tight screenplay and tighter execution, Kaabil hardly gives you anytime to deviate from its narration. The film that begins with a goofy yet appreciable romantic plot between its lead pair Hrithik and Yami, changes momentum in its second half to become an engaging drama! Kaabil won’t disappoint you. Go for it!

Parental Guidance:


Violence: Loads and some gory too. 
Language: No abusive language
Nudity & Sexual content: Rape is talked about and even though it is not explicitly shown, there are scenes where a rape has happened
Concept: Revenge drama
General Look and Feel: Despite being a thriller, the editing is not overdone. So moves along at a decent pace.
