
You don’t expect subtlety and you don’t get it. There is no humility here, Tiger Zinda Hai is about how Tiger aka Salman Khan attempts to save hostages, kill villains, love his family all while he patches up the relationship between India and Pakistan to promote world peace. When you go in wanting that, you walk out smiling because you knew exactly what was going to happen. In that sense, Tiger Zinda Hai is satisfying. Else, it is pretty much mundane.

                        They aren’t experimenting much with the genre by keeping it plain, simple and in line with expectations.
                    
Salman Khan is himself and the rest are just props around him, including Katrina Kaif. Sure, she gets to throw a few kicks around and is quite slick about it too. But, ultimately Tiger Zinda Hai wears the Salman card so much on its sleeve that you don’t even want to spend energy in thinking, “Hey but, how did that happen?”
In fact, the most apparent show of cashing in on Salmania is that he is given some of the lamest lines ever. It is like the writers know that it doesn’t matter what he says, as long as he has the quintessential swagger about it - almost willingly mocking the fans. Especially when the lyricist has come up with decent lines like, “narazgi kagzi teri”1 or “Swag se karenge sabka swagat”2, you wonder why some of it couldn’t have seen its way to the dialogue.

The story does have the villain and the hero outsmart each other constantly but that comes across as going through the drill. The addition of humour and patriotism also look like adding salt and pepper to bring flavour rather than being germane to a plot. Very conveniently the motivation of the covert operation moves from saving lives to national pride to world peace to saving lives to national pride to world peace. 
The humour is not in the jokes or situations as much as it is from the ridiculous concepts. The world’s most romantic 8-year old who is also the hero’s “I don’t care how you do it, just do it” boss, the national spy who also knows how to paint portraits on snow, the number of empty cars blown up, the amount of time the villain gang waits to shoot while the hero’s team does a panorama sweep with a machine gun – bring smirks rather than smiles. 



Amidst this though, the biggest positive is that songs don’t interrupt the proceedings. To that extent things are taken seriously. Of course, the background music more than compensates by abruptly alternating between a romantic tune that is tempered down to be sad as required and a pulsating, thriller, Bond-esque tune. 
Clearly, they aren’t experimenting much with the genre by keeping it plain, simple and in line with expectations. They do tread into the controversial territory of preaching sisterhood between India and Pakistan. While it is a noble thought with a lot of merit but the oversimplification fictionalises it a bit much.
