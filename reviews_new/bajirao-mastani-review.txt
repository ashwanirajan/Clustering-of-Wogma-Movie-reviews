
“One person can be in love with two people at the same time.” “Women are empowered and can hold their own.”  “Religion shouldn't be the basis for love or war.” - Each one of these is a bold theme for one film to take on by itself.  Bajirao Mastani takes it all on together and does justice to all of them.

Film aside, I am in awe that these themes were picked up in real life, a few centuries ago. I hope this is how it all happened. I hope this is how Bajirao Peshwa was – not only a valiant leader, but also stood up for his women and when necessary stood up against them too; fought his wars but was absolutely clear about why he was fighting them – not for religion. I wonder when we regressed. I wonder what problem anyone would have in believing that the man and the women were as they were portrayed here. aso (so be it.)
Such strong personalities - each one of them. Once you get over the each-frame-a-beautiful-canvas visuals that are typical of Bhansali films, you are taken over by the characters. The frames stay beautiful, of course, just that the three main leads weave an interesting web. Mastani (Deepika Padukone), the strong-willed woman consumed by love – yes some women are like that, then and now. Bajirao (Ranveer Singh), known as India's greatest warrior also fell in love and not just once, his vulnerability exposed ever-so slightly. And Kashibai (Priyanka Chopra) – wow! What a lady! Hurting yet holding her pride. 



Priyanka Chopra is an easy winner in this one. Maybe she is relegated to the background for most of the film. But in a couple of “her” scenes – she makes you forget it is her and holds you in awe of Kashibai where you feel her pain too. Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh come across as just pretty people when held against her. They do well, but you begin to notice how after a point they have to hold just one expression. Ranveer Singh overacts a tad bit and has an inconsistent accent. Not that these lapses are intolerable but they make you wonder how much better the performance would have been without. 
There were other things that took away from the film. Like the songs, especially the one with the Peshwa celebrating. No, whether or not they happened all those years ago, whether or not it offends anyone - at least one or two of them should've been cut out – they should've stayed out because they just made the film longer. There were times when the film came across as a saas-bahu1 soap opera, but I guess this was a family drama of its own kind. 
The time lapses were distracting too. Too many times, the narrative moved from one character to another without a smooth flow. Looks like Mr. Bhansali had a lot more shot and had to be cruel on the editing table. Another distraction came with the Marathi words thrown in, isn't it just fine that they are speaking in Hindi in a Hindi film?  Then there was the preachy closing – why-o-why?
Of course, even when put together these aberrations are not huge enough to take away from what's good about the film. Magnificent visuals apart, Bajirao Mastani might be a version of history that I wish is true.

        ...A melodramatic climax aside, the film is undoubtedly a quality product, Bhansali always ensures that. But what makes it fall just short of excellence is the lack of the journey within. We never get inside the characters, especially Bajirao’s, a man who is caught in the fierce dilemma between the heart and the state. We only see the events unfold on screen one after another. It is Bhansali tipping his jewel-encrusted hat off to an epic love story in Maratha folklore. But a glimpse of the mind would have made the picture complete.

The camerawork and SLB’s vision for grandeur create a mirage of excellence on screen. SLB’s music is not only influential it’s emotional and touching. Rarely do Hindi movies look like they belong on a world stage. Bajirao Mastani is definitely a strong contender for that spot. It’s definitely one of the year’s best.

And although the film sets its targets straight and low, it pursues them with unflinching doggedness and sincerity, and achieves them satisfyingly. Most films remain clueless about their faults and merits (if they have any), but this one does, and is smart enough to pick its battles — exhibiting a kind of singular clear sightedness that should be a hallmark of more mainstream movies.

Likewise, Bajirao Mastani bases its drama on the deep love of the titular couple. Except, we don't see why they are in so much love.

When Priyanka asks him about his opponent, he says: “Bhagwan ... kismet”. This signifies his lost battle with his own family and custodians of religion.
