
I was in tears, out of boredom. It hurts when you find a film disgusting enough that it gets to your nerves. It is not about mindless slapstick or the quality of humor, it is more about of the lack of anything at all - complete absence of any thought put in creating a half-decent product. Especially, when there was more than enough potential given a middle-aged Parsi couple. Also, there are a couple of interesting dilemmas to play with. But none are taken too seriously and are in fact, left unaddressed. All you can do then, is shake your head in despair.

Usually a 'How can anyone..." question is pretty vain. The most obvious answer is – "well, like they just did..." But Shirin Farhad Ki Toh Nikal Padi makes it difficult to control from asking a series of such questions. How could Sanjay Leela Bhansali write such an incoherent story? How could every one involved in the film not see how tedious it was getting? How could they make a film less than two hours feel so long? How could anyone think Farah Khan could act?!
The lady talks like she does as a judge in one of the reality shows. Same tone, same expression, plain flat. Any attempt at changing the expressions seem forced and affected. Shirin Farhad...
