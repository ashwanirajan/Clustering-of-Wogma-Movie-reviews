
A coming-of-age film about the protagonist who starts out as a loser, good-for-nothing. Been there, seen that. But Kuku Mathur Ki Jhand Lag Gayi tries its hand at being different. It goes about the "coming-of-age" bit in a non-conventional, non-likeable way even. It adds a little zany to it. But, unfortunately in the end, it plummets into the worst kind of run-of-the-mill.

Kuku's cousin Prabhakar helps clueless Kuku in a very Bawarchi kind of a way. He just happens to be around to help anyone who needs help in Kuku's family. His means might not be the most honest ones, but get the Mathur family members what they want, they do. 
Kuku Mathur Ki Jhand Lag Gayi has its share of annoying, loud characters. Their existence seem to be to make the film feature length from a short. The satirical bits of the writing induce some humor. But, they are stretched so long that you wonder if the writers were only being satirical or they really believed in the hocus-pocus shown. The borderline between spoof and using spoof as a medium to show exactly the same thing that you are spoofing. 
Interestingly, this humbug is where the craziness of the film begins. I am all for quirk in films, but this one gets too literal instead of staying subtle and it comes a bit too late in the film too. 
Then you are left with the performances. Siddharth Gupta and Amit Sial are the only ones you'd remember after you walk out of the theater. And maybe Pallavi Batra for the loud character she plays annoyingly and aptly. None of this enough to make Kuku Mathur Ki Jhand Lag Gayi a watchable film. 
And what's with the seemingly profanity in the title? Or maybe I don't want to know.

For variation, we get Bihari, from a guard and his sari-loving wife whom he has left behind in Darbhanga, and Kanpur Hindi, from Kuku’s badmaash mama. Sit.com territory, stretched out to accommodate a film...

With a lack of soul and a half baked storyline, the film is a bad mishmash of convoluted screenplay, dull writing and hasty execution. Though 109 minutes helps, the exasperation of having to watch the film surpasses the minuscule joy of it being a relatively short film. Sometimes devil gets the better of me and the concept of being thankless jumps out of the window. Something of the same order happened when I watched a jhand film. I am going with 2/5. Avoid a jhand movie because you aren’t a jhand...

It moves at an even pace with some laughs thrown here and there, a dose of romance with Kuku befriending his dream girl Mitali (Mundi) in no time and a hilarous jagran track. Where the script falters is its inability to bring a lump in the throat even as we are shown Kuku’s trials and tribulations while he goes about trying to realise his dream. ...

Parental Guidance:


Violence: A warehouse is set on fire. 
Language: Clean. Though I'm not too sure if "jhand" itself is a clean word.
Nudity & Sexual content: None.
Concept: Self-discovery.
General Look and Feel:  An attempt at keeping it light with satire, but goes weird.
