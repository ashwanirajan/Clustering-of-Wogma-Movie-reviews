
The one thing that sets Raid apart is that it is based on a true life story. If it were not, it could easily be dismissed as yet another idealistic ‘honesty vs. corrupt’, ‘good vs. evil’ story. But, this actually happened. A team of Income Tax Officers showed up at a known corrupt, political goon’s doorstep to conduct a raid based on an anonymous tip. And there wouldn’t have been a story if they didn’t find anything, right? So, there isn’t much of a story to give away. Raid, then does a decent job of building drama while revealing how it all panned out. If only, on its way, it did not fall prey to its misguided effort of doffing its hat to the officers’ families. 

                        It is a shame then that this already engaged frame of mind isn’t capitalised upon.
                    
After you have seen the film, one of the  main things that will stay with you is how the music was a let down. Not only is the background music consistently in your face to fulfill its job description of building drama, but the songs too are disappointing in more than one ways. The music and lyrics are generic but what you really wonder about is why the movie had strewn the songs to lengthen it unnecessarily. Especially considering you know the director has made engaging films without them. It is when the end slides roll that the text on them make you realise the family angle was a way of paying a tribute to the sacrifices made by the officers’ families. And that breaks your heart even more – was superficial and misplaced songs the only way the makers could think of to laud these families?
Everything about the relationship between Amey Patnayak (Ajay Devgn) and his wife, Malini (Ileana D'Cruz) is farcical. From the introduction scene where their pillow talk consists of rum-odour, toothpaste and cardamom seeds to her concern about his safety seem forced and extraneous. Without those ending slides, as a seasoned movie-goer, you would know the only reason she is in the film is to fill in as the hero’s weakness. It doesn’t help that Ileana D'Cruz is as monotonous as ever. There’s just no range.

On the other hand, while we could say the same thing about Ajay Devgn, there is this one scene where he has to portray Amey’s vulnerability and there is the slightest variation in how his eyes shift and his forehead crinkles. And that one scene made me question the existence of all his action films. Why bother with that when you can do this? However, other than this one scene, he just holds on to that dead-pan expression we are well versed with. It is a good thing then, that some of us cannot have enough of it. Especially, when he is mouthing some very well written lines.
The show-stealer though is Saurabh Shukhla. His depiction of corrupt politician, Tauji is on spot. His vulnerability though extraneous to the plot makes his character very interesting. You might not fear Tauji for you aren’t shown much of his tyranny and what he is capable of, but you hate him for his arrogance and want him to lose real bad. 



This I think is also a win for the choice of subject. You know ₹420 crores in 1981 (approximately $65 million at today’s rates) is a lot of money. But, seeing it pour from all over the place, the sheer volume still shook me up. And then to imagine this is owned by just one family. This is the corruption that seeps into our lives. This is the money that will be misused again after it has been confiscated by the government. The issue of corruption itself has you hooked, has you rooting for Amey evidenced by an applause from the audience watching the film. This is despite the fact that Amey’s in-the-face honesty makes you wonder if he spent all his salary on his wife’s lucknowi saris and dresses and a Rayban for himself. You smile at this and move on because you know corruption is being fought with vigour. 
It is a shame then that this already engaged frame of mind isn’t capitalised upon. It becomes a regular Ajay-Devgn-plays-honest-guy vs. bad-guy routine. Except of course, that it is based on a true life story.
