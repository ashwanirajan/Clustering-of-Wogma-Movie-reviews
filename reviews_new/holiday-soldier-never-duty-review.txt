
After the initial "let's get your attention, so you are in your seat" romantic track, Holiday surprises you with  a decent, thickening plot between an army officer and terrorists. But, as it goes with this genre in Hindi, there are way too many plot holes. And even if you ignore them, there are too many side-tracks in the form of songs and sub-plots to take the film seriously.

You have a lead lady (Sonakshi Sinha) who can box, pole vault, play rugby, run, do karate while the lead actor woos her.  In the one song that focuses on her as a character, the main point seems to be Akshay Kumar's dance moves. Come to think of it, I don't think any song has her even lip-syncing. Looks like comic relief ain't enough no more, you need romantic relief. Speaking of which, Govinda is such a misfit and/or waste as comic relief here.
These come across as fillers with the intention of selling a product that you are not confident about. Add to the mix, desperate stylisation of the hero and dialogue that doesn't belong. Which is such a shame because despite the gaps in logic and logistics the plot is not half bad.  



Akshay Kumar fans then might find some respite in the Akshay Kumar-ness of the film. While I have no clue exactly what such a fan looks for, I'd say the actions scenes are cool while they last, though there aren't way too many of them. Hope that helps. 
On the other hand though, there is hardly any challenge for him from the other side. Both, the villain character and actor are just too dull to make you want to root one way or the other. 
Thematically too, Holiday tends to get into the preachy zone, almost reprimanding you for not appreciating the efforts of soldiers at the border. 
Yet, I'd call my 3 hours in the movie hall a success, considering it is nowhere bad to what I expected it to be. Do I give a film extra points for that? Naah. It is just what it is. A casual TV watch if you chance upon it.

But the way he jumps over cars and navigates down building faces is a feat even the fittest 20-year-olds can only dream of. He is the soul of this film. He makes it fun. He gives you your money’s worth. End of the day, that’s all that matters....

Freddy Daruwala matches shoulder to shoulder and bicep to bicep with Akshay Kumar and their hand-to-hand combat on the deck of a ship is worth a whistle or two. The always dependable Govinda gives us comic relief as well.  
Watch this one. It’s total paisa vasool...

        ...In other words, the star’s image had a lot to do with our perception of Thuppakki, and without that particular star, the film’s flaws stand out in sharp relief. Akshay Kumar is a good action hero, a good comedian, probably better than Vijay in both these departments, but he doesn’t have what Vijay has, a unique image – he’s a rather generic presence in his films. When he does the “mass moment” scenes, they don’t send a frisson through us, the way they would when these moments are enacted by popular stars with a strong image. He cannot carry a bad film. His films are good if the writing/directing is good, and here, these aspects are far from satisfactory. Holiday, like Thuppakki, is too long. The romantic track (with Sonakshi Sinha) is too bland, too sexist, too redundant. The emotional beats are weak – we aren’t invested enough in the characters to chew our nails over their fate. Murugadoss told me, in an interview recently, that in his remakes (like Ghajini) he fixes the problems in the original film. Didn’t he think these were problems? Or is the real problem the fact that there’s no Aamir Khan this time around?...
