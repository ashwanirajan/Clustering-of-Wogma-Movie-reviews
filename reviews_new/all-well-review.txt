
I am sure I have mentioned my dislike for film marketing gimmicks like item numbers and closing credit songs. The best thing about All Is Well is the closing credit “shanivar” song and Sonakshi Sinha's “farrata” item number. That and sympathy for the actors are the two things I took from the film. Yes, that bad.

My heart weeps for Abhishek Bachchan. Has it come down to this? For now, I have convinced myself that this is the Ajooba and Jaadugar phase of his career, while being cognizant that he hasn't had his Sholay or Janzeer. Because he is a good actor. Even in a badly written film like this he shows great restraint. He might not be the best fit to play a rockstar, yet his fake nonchalance towards his love interest is pretty believable. Anyway, point being, that is the thing I left the film with – feeling bad for Abhishek Bachchan. 
Of course, my heart wept for Rishi Kapoor and Supriya Pathak too. But somehow, we've seen them in better films in the last few years. Maybe this one worked out best for Asin – as reminder to the audience that she still exists. 



In the form of story, we have a sour parent-child relationship.  A full of himself dad and a thankless son make the perfect combination. But, they are too loud and they bicker – All. The. Time. The characters are pretty much insufferable. Not to mention, the movie tries way too hard to be funny and wraps it up with a sermon on importance of family. Doesn't work one bit. 
As I mentally go through all the departments of film-making wondering if a comment is worth the readers' time and mine, I come back to the same – two foot-tapping songs and deep sorrow for the actors.

The good music, fine performances, few comical and emotional moments makes this movie a neat and clean family drama for its targeted audience...
