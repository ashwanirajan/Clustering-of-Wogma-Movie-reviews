
The most important part of a thriller is how the audience comes to know whodunnit. The actual character who did it or why they did what they did is secondary. Many thrillers cop out on the how by a character narrating how it all happened. There is no unraveling only a summarised monologue of a revelation. When that happens, the build-up seems like a tool to keep your attention rather than to get you thinking and involved. If you haven’t guessed it yet, Ittefaq does exactly that. A rich thriller story which could have been enhanced in its telling is let down by the way it executes the crux.

                        The humour deviates from the thrill rather than giving you a break from it. Both the existence of humor and non-existence of thrill are to be equally blamed.
                    
Other than that Ittefaq has the usual murder-mystery aura about it. Through flashbacks, the accusation passes from one suspect to another and back as fast as a parcel does the rounds in a game of passing the parcel. When it stops, the game slows down. 
While each flashback builds the story, the present time sequences mostly have the suspects saying they didn’t do it – which they have been doing a lot of, on their real-life Twitter accounts too. These scenes also have extraneous elements such as a flickering tubelight or the investigating officer, Dev’s home and wife. In hindsight these seem like fillers to extend the run-time.

It would have helped if the clues in the investigation in present-time didn’t come about so easily in the first half. Interestingly, Dev is introduced as this smug investigating officer who just knows where to look for evidence. Later in the film though, he turns into a cop who happens to remember evidence because of what he is doing perchance and reaches new conclusions. No slick deductive skills there. The CSI/Dexter-esque analysis seems like an afterthought. 
Then there are the logical questions like, why is the interrogation in piecemeal in the first place? Wouldn’t the officers get the whole story out in one sitting? Had the story moved forward more in the non-flashback parts of the film, the film would have felt less like a drag. For a film that is less than 2 hours, Ittefaq spends a fair amount of time lingering – and not in a good way. The tone is set by the chase sequence that the film begins with. It goes on for over five minutes and nothing additional is being told to you in those introductory scenes. If at all, it focuses on a police officer who snoozes and takes pleasure in scaring suspects and witnesses alike – and he is not even one of the main characters of the film! 



A fair amount of time is also spent on  dry humor. A thriller usually uses humour to relieve you from the intensity of the suspense. Here though the mystery doesn’t build up enough and the humour ends up deviating from the little thrill. 
I was also distracted by the continuity in lighting. Usually in such cases, I don’t let the technical aspects of film-making bother me, but Ittefaq’s indecisiveness about whether it is night and day was too difficult to ignore. A scene that looks like it is day-time is interspersed between scenes of the same night. No, this wasn’t an attempt at non-linearity. 

                        No slick deductive skills there.
                    
What keeps you interested is actually the hope of a mind-bending twist, which unfortunately doesn’t come about. On the other hand, except for the title, I’m glad Ittefaq doesn’t fall for the other crime that thrillers are usually guilty of – intentionally misleading the audience. 
Also thankfully, the performances even if not the greatest, aren’t distracting either. Siddharth Malhotra does well to keep his expressions ambiguous. If you believe he is not guilty, you will see innocence. If you believe he is guilty, you will see a hidden smirk. Sonakshi Sinha too does well to don completely different avatars in the two versions of the story. Akshaye Khanna anchors the film with a monotonous expression, but that is attributable to the writing. A thriller that attempts to be tight ought to have minimal role for side characters, but Ittefaq gives them too much room. Due to no fault of theirs, this invasion got me annoyed at the actors. 
I submit I am equally annoyed at not being brought to the edge-of-my-seat. I didn’t see myself taking sides and swaying with the alternating narratives. And the worst of it all, at the end, I felt like I was at a screenplay narration and not at the screening of a chilling narrative.
