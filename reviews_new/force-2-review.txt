
Movies with a social message either seem like the social message is squeezed into a story that the writers had in mind or the other way around. With Force 2 you can't make out which came first. I wish I could say that it meant the social message flowed seamlessly in and out of the story. Nope, the non-existent story comes about towards the fag end of the film. Till then it is only one chase sequence after another.

                        I guess we can take this as an encouraging trend – the lady's character in an action film is a sidekick rather than the usual pretty prop.
                    
If only the chase sequences had anything novel about them. It seemed like we have an action film, we have Budapest with all its beautiful roof-tops, so how can we not have a rooftop chase sequence. With an exception or two, there is no creativity in the other action sequences too. 
The thriller story is more or less a non-story. The villains intentions and motivations aren't something that hook us any more, are they? Sure, at least the villain here is two steps ahead of the hero so we are to wonder what he has up his sleeve. But, it never reaches a crescendo where you can't wait to find out or be bothered if you don't.

For all the talk of  “why are you surprised to find a woman at the job?” talk, RAW agent KK (Sonakshi Sinha) is always a few steps behind Yash (John Abraham) – both physically and mentally. Sure, it might have more to do with KK being a sidekick and not have anything to do with gender. I guess we can take this as an encouraging trend – the lady's character in an action film is a sidekick rather than the usual pretty prop.
John Abraham, Sonakshi Sinha and Tahir Raj Bhasin aren't really required to have too many expressions – they grimace, stay confused and smirk respectively. 
For an action film, Force 2 doesn't have any thrill. It is rather plain despite the pounding background score and snappy editing that goes with the genre. Or maybe it is a plain thriller because it has the usual things you expect from the genre.

        ...Force 2 is not a great one for spreading the message of peace. It would rather do its job of giving us stunts that keep us riveted to our seats. But it does bring up the issue of a very disturbing political tragedy whereby those who are caught spying are disowned by their own country. It’s a chilling thought on betrayal and loss, not quite the mood that this upbeat fiery and feisty actioner wants to dwell on. But it really can’t really help acquiring a conscience while taking a well-aimed shot at giving Hollywood stunts films a run for their money.

Shiv is captured and driven to the airport by Yash and Karanjeet to be brought to justice in India. Nobody thinks to ask for back-up or, at the very least, a bullet-proof vehicle. This tribute to RAW is undercooked, but it manages to retain its crowd-pleasing flavour. The action is nasty and short, and before any “what just happened” questions can be asked, ACP Yash delivers yet another punch. It’s not quite India’s answer to the Mission: Impossible films, but at least on the thrills front, it’s halfway there.

Meanwhile, Sinha looks completely clueless, as though she walked into a wrong film set. It’s left entirely up to Bhasin then to hold our interest with his blabbering, psychological games and mouth organ. He, at times, overcompensates for the po-faced leads but largely manages to hold some amount of interest even if his character itself seems like a long lost twin of the evil avatar he played in Mardani. Time, for a talented actor like him, to move on, before the supposed charisma turns into a worn-out cliché.
