
Lucknow Central keeps you more or less engaged with its performances and pulsating ambiance of thrill. But if you disconnect, you might even squeeze in a snooze because of its slack pace.

                        Lucknow Central seems like yet another “prison” film.
                    
Wrongly imprisoned protagonist, crushed aspirations, vicious inmate who wants to show his power, even more intimidating jailer who is out to get the protagonist, a wish to escape it all, a sympathising well-wisher – the usual tropes of a “prison” film are all present in Lucknow Central. What you are looking forward to then is something different in what links these predictable aspects together. 
While the first half  is full of what you would expect, the only variety from other “prison” films is the intensity and type of torture of fist-fights between inmates. The second half brings in some edge-of-the-seat moments leading to one of the two possible climaxes, making the end largely predictable.

That leaves you with the performances. Surprisingly, you aren't able to shrug off the feeling that Kishan, the lead character is Farhan Akhtar. Only well into the second half, are a couple of scenes he blends into the milieu. In fact, it is the side character who make the atmosphere believable. Even though Ronit Roy's characters are almost always bad news, as the jailer of Lucknow Central, he sends a chill down the spine every time he appears on screen. His stand-offs against Ravi Kishan are entertaining and yet seem real. 
Other than a couple of those and a few moments of thrill though, Lucknow Central seems like yet another “prison” film. In fact, the story is quite similar to the other one a few weeks ago, Qaidi Band Review. Thankfully it loses the tone of propaganda. Yet, it stays only moderately engaging.
