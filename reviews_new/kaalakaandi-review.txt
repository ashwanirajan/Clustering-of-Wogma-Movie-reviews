
Is it three stories or is it none? There’s so much happening and yet so little. That is the kind of screenplay Kaalakaandi has. When taken individually, only one story is different enough to get you interested. Fortunately, it is also enough for you to watch all three stories without getting bored. The performances though are excellent through and through.

                        Films with multiple threads aren’t new and yet they tend to create an energetic vibe about them.
                    
Down to the character artist with the smallest role, each actor seems just so comfortable in their skin. As if they were given a character sketch, the approximate lines and the liberty to do what they wanted within the context of the scene. It is sheer joy to watch each character in control. 
Saif Ali Khan comes off with some classy comic timing. It has been ages since he has seemed so much at ease, almost like he is telling us, I don’t care if this flops, I know I am doing my best. Nary Singh show what who plays Sheela brings a smile, the kind of smile the depiction of transpersons or prostitutes never brings.

Kaalakaandi – approximately means messing up – has three stories, each one having characters who land themselves in messed up situations. In some sense, each of these stories is about how the characters manage their consciences after the mess-up. 
And yet the film doesn’t take itself too seriously. From use and abuse of narcotics to a respectful attitude towards transgender prostitution to the regular double-crossing goons to repeated jaba at policemen and the law and admin system to cancer – Kaalakaandi maintains a light yet insightful vein. 



A lot of the dialogue is in English and a lot of the Hindi is cuss words. The abusive language does come across as “for effect” at times. But, like real life, you just automatically ignore and focus on the other content of the film. And thankfully there is enough to enjoy too. 
The VFX while cheesy is quite amusing. It’s not the creative best but each time it is unexpected, even though you know there is a pattern for the visuals. Similarly, the music while not outstanding goes well with the sequences in the film.

Films with multiple threads aren’t new and yet they tend to create an energetic vibe about them. It is clear that one or two of the threads are weak and the stronger threads are bearing the burden. Yet, when done well, it can be pulled off and that’s how it goes for Kaalakaandi. You see the weaknesses, but for the two hours you see through them.

Sure, there are some expectations in the second half that are not met - like the sudden excitement when you see Khan in a Birdman-like costume, only to see it lead nowhere - but that would be akin to nitpicking just for the heck of it.

Possibly. As a film, I felt it lacks rhythm, with too much being force-fed to suit the timeline of one never-ending night in Bombay, even if that's the genre. The end might make you go, "Eh?" But through it all, you're more likely to go, "Hah!" So nah, I'm not complaining at all.

While 47-year-old Khan is committed to his character, has the best lines, he fails to keep this sinking ship afloat. Even Akshay Oberoi who channels more intensity than required for such a film, would've been better suited if his character was written with some more heft.
