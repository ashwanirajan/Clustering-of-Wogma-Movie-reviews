
Indians living abroad. Oh, what a rotten life they have! They have to make an identity for themselves, especially in a sport. So, what do they do? They make a team that has only Indians, naaah...these particular people are Punjabis, so they make a team of only Punjabis to fight the goras (Whites). Such is the convoluted interpretation of liberalism and/or nationalism.

Fine, I wasn't supposed to expect anything else from a film that calls itself Speedy Singhs. But, shouldn't there be at least a ghost of a story. Some conflict that will make me wonder what's to happen next. Let alone that, the conflict itself is predictable. 
So, then, we have stand-up comedian Russell Peters and chocolate boy Vinay Virmani to look forward to. Or not. Though, it is imperative to mention that I saw a dubbed version of the film, which means all the actors were speaking out translations of English dialogues in Hindi in the utmost ridiculous fashion, you know like Night at a Museum in Hindi. Yes, Rob Lowe too! Oh, how I felt for one of my favorite West Wing actors. 
The bhangra, the toilet jokes, and given there's Russell Peters, there are the racial, political incorrect humor too. None of it entertains or makes me laugh. It just felt like one of the films that make you go numb even if they are short.
