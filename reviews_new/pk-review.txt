
Rajkumar Hirani has a knack for attacking a problem headon but with a smile. As usual the issue is important, and given the events of this week, it is of global significance, though PK doesn't necessarily spread its wings that far. While the jokes are slightly on the lame side, the point made is powerful even if readers of this site might not be the direct target audience for the arguments.





(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});


Most of the citybred, Generation Next a la the multiplex audience is already on the story-tellers' side. We would make the same arguments in a coffee table conversation. But the beauty here is Hirani keeps it simple. With single-minded focus he attacks the problem, quite literally, using child-like innocence. 
His use of humor, didn't make me laugh or even smile, but the entire theater was in splits, especially most of the first half. For matters of such importance, that most people are getting more and more right of center about without thinking it through, it is just important to get the audience to listen. So, whatever works. 



What worked for me the most is that PK was PK and not Aamir Khan. Sure, his mannerisms did feel a little exaggerated but they became a part of the character. After a long, long while a character he played didn't remind me it was him. In fact, while jotting my notes, at one point I found myself writing Anushka Sharma to PK! That form me was another victory for the film. 
Not that Anushka Sharma didn't perform well, it was easier to remember her as the actor rather than the character. A lot of the other players too - Saurabh Shukla, Boman Irani, Parikshit Sahni keep the film on its mark without attracting too much attention towards them, which is no small feat in itself. Else, Hindi films are so proficient at making caricatures out of Godmen that it is a welcome relief when it doesn't happen.
But, PK is not one of those films that would need extra points for what it didn't do. It has enough going for it. Rajkumar Hirani films aren't great works of cinema in terms of other departments of filmmaking. They keep their background music, camerawork, post production to the minimum. Their focus is on the writing, (with a few diversions in form of songs and a romantic track). And they don't even rely too much on subtlety and symbolism.
In fact, these are films when the characters are as uni-dimensional as they get. Also, ironically, you have to take major leaps of faith as the films have a boatload of flaws and over-simplifies complex issues. It is irksome at most times, yet you are willing to let it go. Because the films say it like it is, and keep you engaged while making a point without becoming too preachy. That in itself is a full plate. 
Fortunately or unfortunately, sometimes that doesn't bring anything new to a person who is on the same side of the argument. The same concern I had with OMG Oh My God. Blind faith and misuse of blind faith that feeds on fear is something we have to deal with on a day-to-day basis. So, the points made in and by PK are drawing room conversations you and I might have had umpteen number of times. It's good to see our point of view represented and presented in a manner that should make sense to those who follow God and more importantly Godmen blindly. I would applaud it for finding the balance and not defying the existence of a supreme power. 
To say the film focussed only on one religion would be completely missing the point. It is up to us to extrapolate it to the religion of our choice, including our own. How many of us will "get it" and be able to internalise it is a completely different question altogether. 
Every Hirani film coins a phrase that eventually becomes common parlance, "jaadu ki jhappi", "all is well", "Gandhigiri" and now "wrong number". Fortunately, one you don't mind taking.

It broke my heart then raised my spirits. If I were a Bollywood writer, I might have ended this review with: Lagey raho, Rajubhai. I’ll just leave it at: Thank you for the Christmas gift, Team PK...

        ...Rajukumar Hirani follows a certain discipline with his filmmaking. Between him and co-writer Abhijat Joshi, they make sure their screenplay has certain finesse. They use dreamscapes to push in colourful songs. They do it maintain an integrity for their characters and story. Such attention to writing detail is a rare practice in India. But it’s a healthy habit of making films. And it ensures top notch quality, one that PK has in abundance. Reiterating, this is a Hirani, Aamir Khan and Vidhu Vinod Chopra film we’re talking of. They’ve set high standards for themselves. But with dodgy and inconsistent dialogue and repetitive visuals which look too similar to 3 Idiots and Lage Raho Munnabhai, PK doesn’t quite match up to the mark. It’s certainly not Hirani’s best. But it is good enough to engage and entertain the majority of its audience....

It felt like the post-interval portions were directed by a different director and not Hirani. One of the hallmarks of a Hirani film are the strong supporting characters and PK has no character that stands out. There was too much focus on PK and that's what undid the film. Having said that, PK is definitely better than 95% of the films that are made in Bollywood. It deserves a watch but doesn't have the repeat value of 3 Idiots or Munnabhai films. Don't make the mistake of expecting too much and PK will keep you hooked....
