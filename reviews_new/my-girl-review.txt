Most women I know have admitted to hating or being scared at the thought of having children. It’s surprising actually; they’re all killing the cliché about women loving babies. Even so, you’ll usually see people fawning over infants, children below the age of 7 or 8. Let’s face it, when was the last time you heard someone say, “OMG, I met the most adorable 11 year old!”?

In Howard Zeif’s My Girl, however, you end up feeling a surging love for the two lead 11-year olds, Vada (Anna Clumsky) and Thomas J (Macaulay Culkin, yes the Home Alone kid). My Girl is a story about two kids and their innocent, starry-eyed lives as they move through life’s offerings.
Vada is a hypochondriac attention seeker – typical pre-teen, who feels like the world’s coming to an end because her father, who owns a funeral parlour, has found new-found love in his make-up artist (Jamie Lee Curtis). She confides her crazy theories, intellectual rants and thoughts in Thomas J, her only friend. 
The setting is very "The Wonder Years" like; both kids face the regular troubles of a pre-teenage; You can sense a deep, deep friendship between the two – one they might not even be aware of. He claims Vada is his girl (via a more mature voiceover that gages the film) – and that’s how you can see exactly why the movie is called so.
Vada’s father (Dan Ackroyd) is a typical sitcom father –one who instills enough into Vada but is ignorant of her needs and questions. It’s her relationship with her father, and her fears that leads to her personality – one of questions, admirations, astonishments and an endearing naiveté.
