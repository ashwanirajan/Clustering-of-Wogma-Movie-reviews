
Monsoon Shootout gets so many things right by just keeping things simple and straightforward. Else, a story that involves change in consequences depending on the choice a character makes could get too confusing, too quick. Also, it gives the writer room to explore the crux of the story – the dilemma. You are engaged through most of it because it is like watching 3 short films, with characters who you have grown familiar with.

                        The first viewing certainly promises that there are details you could have missed out.
                    
This build-up of characters across the choices intrigued me the most. The story around the last choice wouldn’t have had an impact, if we didn’t know what we knew about the characters. Also, by this last round, you also are familiar with the tone of the film. You know whatever the protagonist does, his life is a bit of a mess.  And you still wish he comes out at least half successful. This is the hook. Your emotion entangled with the good guy for nothing but his goodness. You almost don’t want him to have to struggle with right, wrong and the paths in between. 
While dealing with these larger philosophical questions, Monsoon Shootout also points fingers at each wheel, in the gear system, that makes being dutiful and principled so difficult – the business-politician-administration nexus, the objectification and exploitation of women, the wrong ways of doing the right thing, having to accept that the end justifies the means, and despite it all, the expected morality from a common person.

The wonderfully woven script brings out the protagonist’s vulnerability as simply as if it were a flow chart. Sure, it gets a tad repetitive and slightly long-drawn towards the end. But arguably, the choices ended at the peak. 
The writing is also elegant in that the characters don’t drastically change even though their choice-dependent world has changed. It must certainly have been tempting to draw contrasts by making the unknowns diametrically opposite in nature. 



This is one of those rare films that has such a firm grip on the writing that it makes the work of the actors look easy. The three protagonists played by Vijay Verma, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, and Neeraj Kabi might be varied in terms of experience but have been bankable since their first films. Unfortunately, the supporting characters came across as caricatures. 
And yet, it is acceptable enough to not take away from the various points the film wants to make. Monsoon Shootout is certainly one of those I’d like to watch again to observe the nuances I might have failed to notice. Yes, the first viewing certainly promises that there are details you could have missed out.

        ...Some of the moral dilemma, specially those involving the criminal’s young teenaged son (interesting juvenile newcomer Farhan Mohammad Hanif Shaikh) are disturbing to the extreme. Director Amit Kumar doesn’t hesitate from making hard choices on behalf of his characters. Consequently, this dark blood-dimmed film leaves us with a hollow feeling in our stomachs.

        ...There’s nothing superfluous in the storytelling. The cinematography, the relentless rain, the background music and the tension between Shiva and Adi give Monsoon Shootout its mood and intensity. But the editing is abrupt at times. It feels like the characters are missing a dimension that would make them less like characters in a tableau. So although Kumar’s film is emotionally wanting, it is technically accomplished and skilfully engaging.

Siddiqui's performance is remarkable, but since he's been essaying the same kinds of roles, it also seems monotonous. The movie also has the usual clichés, like Adi meeting his ex-flame Anu (Geetanjali Thapa), who has now become a nurse. A song featuring the two looks forced. But this one's surely worth a watch.

        ...The bigger and more abstract idea – morality changes depending on the point of view – gets a bit lost in the efforts taken to ensure that each of the tracks is separate from one another as well as coherence. Yet, the movie works perfectly as a neo-noir thriller set in a city where nothing goes according to plan. One moment has several scenarios in Monsoon Shootout, but the outcome – smart writing and direction – remains the same throughout.

        ...But what dilutes the impact of the narration and a dependable cast is the familiarity of the account chosen to represent a significant psychological aspect. The basic idea that a do-gooder-rulebook-greenhorn is pulled down by the internal politics and corruption in the system overshadows the potential impressive psycho-cosmic angle of human decision making in the larger scheme of things. And ultimately gives this film a certain delusional greatness towards the climax. So what could’ve been a thrilling masterpiece remains an artsy thriller in search of a better plot.

Vijay Varma makes a fairly assured debut in a lead role and Nawazuddin Siddiqui plays evil with a smirk and elan. Since the actors reprise their roles thrice over, they often don't have enough screen time to flesh out their characters adequately.
