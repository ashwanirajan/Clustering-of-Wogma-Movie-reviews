
Sulu is not a character you see too often in films. You can see the great deal of thought that has gone into writing the character. That is true for the other characters too. Unfortunately, the story meanders to the point of taking the entire film down with it, and along the way you have repetitive character traits and situations. 

                        realistically written and executed ambiance makes even the most ridiculous stories believable … and yet it is voyeurism of middle-class lives
                    
So, Sulu (Vidya Balan) is chirpy and we see a lot of those in Hindi films. In fact, the other radio jockey in the film, Albeli Anjali (Malishka Mendonsa) who is the regular brand of chirpy we see in Hindi films shows you how different Sulu’s chirp is. Sulu differentiates herself because of the milieu she belongs to – the simplicity of a middle-class family. She makes tea for her family and wrings clothes out of her washing machine with the same spirit as she performs as a radio jockey. Her vigor and humor is indefatigable. She is so comfortable with her personality and sees perfect sense in the most impractical ideas she wants to follow through on. And yet she is more comfortable when she is by herself in the quiet of her day – you see the same content when she talks into the mic and has become oblivious to the people around her. For a person with a relatively conservative background, she is extremely non-judgmental. She thinks it is perfectly fine for her to take calls from horny men at a late night radio show, as a jockey. In fact, her charm and grounded attitude towards callers converts people who laugh at her to people who laugh with her. 
Sulu is no feminist. She is not struggling any more because she is a woman. Being a wife and mother to her son is a part of her being. Her relatively more-accomplished sisters (Sindhu Shekharan and Seema Taneja) are working women who put her down with their dad in an almost Cinderella-esque manner. They ask Sulu’s husband, Ashok (Manav Kaul), who is prince charming of his own kind, to talk sense into her. But, it still have nothing to do with feminism. Collectively, they are not upset because Sulu has taken up a job being a woman. They are not happy with the kind of job she is doing. Ashok begins to get bitter not because she is working but because she is talking to horny men in her sexiest voice. He is romantically jealous, not necessarily professionally so.

And yet, the feminism comes through in the subtlest of forms when a passer-by woman police officer is dropping her child to school while asking him to make sure he eats well. Many characters who are not usually women are being performed by women in Tumhari Sulu - from the night-shift cab-driver (Trupti Khamkar) to the radio station’s head (Neha Dhupia) to the police officers on night duty and even the sisters who mentally harass Sulu – any of these roles could have been assigned to men and we wouldn’t bat an eye. But, women in these roles, made the film more feminist than it would have been if Sulu had to fight for her right to do the job she likes against a dominating husband or father. 
Objectification too is highlighted in an indirect way. At one end you have Sulu who is taking calls from men, who would most likely be calling because Sulu’s sultry voice makes them horny. At the other end you have Ashok who seems to be living a typical married life with a weekly/monthly limit on sex.  And at yet another end, you have their pre-teen son, Pranav (Abhishek Sharrma) who rents out adult magazines and CDs to his classmates. Tumhari Sulu doesn’t bother with making a value judgment of any of these, it just puts it out there. 



Note how you know so much about the side-characters. It is a shame then, that despite the warmth with which each character is written – even Ashok’s irate boss or the writer for Sulu’s radio programme (Vijay Maurya) – the story comes across as forced and relatively lame with of course, one of the weirdest resolutions in films. It is almost like the three broad departments of writing – story, characters and dialogue are different skill sets. 
It has always surprised me how realistically written and executed ambiance makes even the most ridiculous stories believable. The middle-class setting of a suburb on the outskirts of North Mumbai – with tiny houses which have living rooms that double up as dining rooms, that house families who consider Rs. 40,000 per month as a well-paying job – make you want to believe the ridiculous, fairy-tale like chance that Sulu gets to become a radio jockey. This is despite the low-income texture being forced down on you with close-ups of clothespins and cluttered sills. In fact, there were times when I thought the audience was being made to look down up on this setting with amusement as if the makers were writing an essay on – “the other life in urban suburbia: look at them, this is how they live” - middle-class porn of sorts.

                        Sulu is no feminist. She is not struggling any more because she is a woman. Being a wife and mother to her son is a part of her being.
                    
The songs that interrupt the story seem forced too. Except for one song, the rest come across as avoidable fillers. 
At its heart then, are the performances by one and all. Since, most of what you enjoy in Tumhari Sulu is the characters, it wouldn’t have worked out if it weren’t for able performances across the board. There is no way to know, relate and connect with the characters, to the point of being in tears in an otherwise comedy film, without the actors taking on their characters as their selves. Yes, I realise having one piddly paragraph for the actors when they have all done so well is not fair. But, words and more words praising each remarkable performance isn’t good enough either. The only way to do justice to performances of this caliber is to watch the film – if you can watch a film only for its characters and the performances, that is.
