
Not all stories are meant to get you totally involved with the characters or situations. Some are just stories that you listen to or see. Qarib Qarib Singlle is one such story – of a man and a woman who set out on a journey to get to know each other under the guise of meeting the man’s ex-es. Neither of the characters are entirely believable, nor is the situation they put themselves in, common place in real life. But, you play along because of the humor and the film’s warm texture. The warmth, however, makes the film a little too cozy slacking off into a snooze every once in a while. 

                        Unfortunately the first time most of us would have seen and laughed at  them is in the trailer.
                    
The beauty of Qarib Qarib Singlle is that you know the characters quite well. You know Jaya (Parvathy Thiruvothu) is comfortable with being single because she has no qualms watching films in a theater by herself, or cooking and having a drink by herself. At the risk of stereotyping she is the kind of person who does web development as a hobby. And Yogi is the one who can doze off into deep slumber at the mention of ‘w’ in ‘web development’. He laughs at his own poor puns. He regularly misses trains and planes. And all of this seems normal to us. For she like many of us will carry a sanitizer on them and still be happy living in a no-star ashram. And he earns enough to afford and prefers the comforts of a 5-star hotel, but at the same time stops his cab midway to pick up villagers who are walking barefoot on the roadside under the scorching sun.
Having developed such beautiful characters, the writers stay away from making them come-of-age which is remarkable. This gives room to these aging characters to be mature. They are both have an opinion and judge the other. Yet neither of them seeks to change the other either. The lively, quirky, more interesting one doesn’t want to introduce the quieter, conventionally boring person into the colours of life. Both lead characters have the gentlest of arches because they are both very comfortable with who they are. Which is why Jaya’s sense of liberation seems hollow when she breaks the mould.

Also, given these characters that Yogi falls for Jaya is a little unconvincing. You can see Jaya slowly getting attracted towards this character, but that Yogi wants to have a long-term relationship with Jaya is to be taken for granted. 
This could have a bit to do with Parvathy Thiruvothu’s act too, especially her dubbing. It is not that she doesn’t try hard to give a good performance, it is that the effort show. The heaving and sighing are a bit too loud giving this otherwise self-assured lady an air of always being anxious and hyper. Irrfan Khan of course wears his dead-pan look with elan. There was a time a couple of years ago when I was worried that I would be borer of this act. But, doesn’t look like it is happening any time soon, for with every film he makes me like/hate his character even better.



While the characters and dialogue are done reasonably well, the overall story progresses very slowly. This is understandable considering the characters aren’t making any huge transformations. But, it makes things lacklustre at regular intervals. 
Parvathy breaking the 4th wall or river-rafting or an additional character in the for of the cab driver seem as mere tools to break the rhythm slightly. It doesn’t help that you have seen this formula of meeting the ex-es in Bachna Ae Haseeno. Even so, I am thankful that the film is kept fresh by keeping the gloss and glamour out. 

                        The aging lead characters get room to be mature  because there is no pressure to come-of-age.
                    
The quippy lines and funny situations are new when you see them for the first time and they bring a smile too. But, unfortunately the first time most of us would have seen and laughed at  them is in the trailer. So, while Irrfan Khan’s performance can hold you through the film. The real-life like, dullish treatment works both for and against the film. The glitz is out but that ends up making things boring. Qarib Qarib Singlle doesn’t get the balance right.

With solid writing and great performances, a perfect ambience of Tinder-driven modern courtship this is definitely one of the best films of director Tanuja Chandra's career. A light but spectacularly adroit romantic comedy....

Eeshit Narain’s pleasing cinematography and Chandan Arora’s editing produce a fabulous last shot – the final vehicle carrying Jaya and Yogi heading inexorably towards its destination, indicating both closure as well as a new beginning.

Eeshit Narain's cinematography also adds to the film's realism by beautifully capturing the subjects in their natural elements, without resorting to over-dramatic shots.
