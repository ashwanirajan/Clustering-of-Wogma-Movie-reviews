You are out for dinner with a few friends. One of them is a little upset because of something that happened during the day. He gets irritated by something the waiter does and bursts out in anger at him. The waiter had done something really petty, something wrong but not a big deal. What will you do? Join in with your friend? Defend the waiter because it was not really his mistake, but this means you are going against your friend. This is only a minor version of the dilemmas Right Yaaa Wrong presents. The story moves along interestingly and is thought-provoking. If only, it was a tighter and had better performances, it would be a must watch.

I completely enjoyed how as an audience, I really didn't know whose side I was on. Both seemed right and both seemed wrong. Both evoked my sympathy, I wanted both to win. And all of this together kept me involved, engaged. 
Sure, I wasn't 100% involved 100% of the time. First one to blame there is the choice of slow-pace for a genre that needs to be chop-chop. The other one is the lousy performances. Each one of them is performing perfunctorily. The dialogue delivery is extremely amateurish. Especially the bits in which the police officers are bonding in the beginning. 
True, they are just setting the stage for bits and pieces to be used later. But the functional way in which relationships are put forward make them look manipulated and contrived together. So much so that the likes of Irrfan Khan and Konkona Sen Sharma can't cover-up for the others. 
These are huge minuses. So, the story had to take over that much more burden of making the film work. And it does. I enjoyed the back and forth and for me that was enough to make my trip to the theater worth it beyond this review. I enjoy court-room drama as much as I enjoy intelligent characters out-witting each other. They might not be the smartest turn of events but they had basic thought put in, which is conspicuous by their absence in many films of this day. 
Yeah, I'm surprised too. I actually liked a film titled as lamely as Right Yaaa Wrong (especially the extra aa) starring Sunny Deol. Dancing, fuming, and all. But, this is what even a decent attention to story can do to me.
