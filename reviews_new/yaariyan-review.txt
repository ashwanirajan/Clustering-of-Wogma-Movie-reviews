
For a person who watches at least two films a week in the theaters, including some really bad ones, I admit  it is difficult for films to get me hooked. But, hand-in-hand, it is equally difficult to keep me more than 100% detached from what's going on on screen. Even when my expectations are low, I am on the watch for something to like, something to enjoy. But Yaariyan, manages to even take that away from me.

The screenplay is all over the place here. The only clarity it seems to have is that it knows not what to do with itself. It is almost like they used a trial and error method of sticking blocks of story together. 
That is especially sad considering the individual blocks of story are rather random in the first place. Picture this - Four pretty much good-for-nothing kids in college are picked up to defend the honor the college. Why? While you have given up on finding an answer to that, the principal of the college insists on giving reasons which might as well have not been given. 
So, they have to compete with some college school in Australia and jingoism follows. The competition continues to be pointless and the worst bit is absolutely disgusting sub-plots lengthen the runtime of the film.
If I go about looking for a needle in the hay stack, I would say the only Rakul Preet came across as someone who might be a good actor if given a chance. She's sweet and has a fresh spontaneity about her that I'd like to see more of. And I say this with Deepti Naval and Gulshan Grover in the cast. Then you have a couple of songs the lyrics of which strike a chord, but why would you suffer a film for lyrics?
Very rarely, do I say this about a film, but this once I have to - there go two and a half hours of my life. Especially considering the Pune International Film Festival is on. Sigh
