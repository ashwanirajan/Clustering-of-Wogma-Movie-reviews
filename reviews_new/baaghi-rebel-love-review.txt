
The quick review says it all - “Background score builds tension rather than the story, which is contrived in itself to showcase action sequences, only a few of which are sort-of not-seen-before.”

Let me break that up. The background music is relentless, especially in the second half. Even if it takes a breather for a few seconds, you can feel it in the silence because of its assault thus far.  It is as if all the onus of building suspense was left to it, because – no story.
You can't fault the writers though. They have been asked to fit the story to squeeze in as many action sequences as is possible. There is no building character, only piling one action sequence after another. In fact, the only way they allow the lead lady to hold her own is by throwing in a kick or two. The story is summarised as follows: Boy meets girl. Another boy also meets girl, kidnaps her. What happens next?



What is going to happen next? I doubt there can be anything more predictable than the answer to that question. So, what can you do? More action. Of course.
The actions sequences are repetitive and offer nothing in terms of variety. There are a few times they have a couple of characters hold postures that look mind-blowing and make you admire the ab-control. And there a few other scenes where bones are broken in a manner to make you jolt. 
The one main thing that that one-liner leaves out is the performances. But, that it was left out must mean a lot by itself, right? Tiger Shroff cannot act. Well, at least not so far. Each line comes out as if it is the dialogue of the decade. That is as filmy as it gets. Shraddha Kapoor maybe can but there is nothing worthy required here. Her kicks and chops aren't the best. Though, unlikely as it is, I hope that is intentional because her character is not really an expert. 
Other than that there are these 'comic relief' characters that remind you of the worst from the 90s. The attempt at tugging at your heart is so superficial that they don't even bother to give you a backstory or resolution. 
Oh well. The only good thing I can say about Baaghi is that I have seen worse.

        ...On the whole, BAAGHI is a typical masala entertainer which scores high on action and performances from the lead cast. With focus on entertainment, the film is, without a doubt, the best action film to come out of Bollywood in recent times. It has all the merits to hit the jackpot. At the box office, it will be lapped up by the masses on the account of its masala quotient. Highly recommended.

The remembrance of the ancient Indian martial art - Kalaripayattu makes BAAGHI - a true Indian martial arts movie and we give an extra for that.

Tiger Shroff, with Turkish, Belgian, Bengali and Gujarati blood, is interesting looking. But how many times must we watch him throw a 360 helicopter kick? Many times, I fear, because the boy can’t act. At all. He can fight.

On the other hand, Shraddha is extremely reflective of her emotions and she is best at doing what we have known her for. The expectation of seeing Shraddha doing a lot of action doesn't get fulfilled. And we see the part of her that we already knew. So, she doesn't offer anything new....

The interior shots when Tiger enters the villain’s multistoried den are shot realistically too. Music by Meet Bros, Amaal Mallik, Ankit Tiwari and Manj Musik is hummable. Amaal Malik composed Sab tera, sung by Armaan Malik and Shraddha, is the pick of the lot. Shraddha isn’t just a coy maiden waiting to be rescued but a fierce spirit who doesn’t pull her punches. The leads do share a spark of chemistry and look pleasant together. But all said and done, it’s Tiger’s film and barring some emotional scenes, where he needs to up his game, he fights and dances like a dream. This film is going to be his litmus test. Here’s hoping that he passes it with flying colours, as we do need genuine action stars in our films…

If you want any story or entertainment in your movies, then Baaghi will end up boring you. It is incohesive, and disjointed which solely relies on the action skills of its lead actor to further its story. However, it is a harmless movie which doesn’t aim to tell a super serious story about an important social subject and it needs to be judged that way. And as a light entertainer, Baaghi is passable and can be watched once.
