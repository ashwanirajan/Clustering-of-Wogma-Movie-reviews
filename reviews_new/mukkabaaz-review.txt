
Casteism, feminism, bureaucracy, state of sports – Mukkabaaz takes on all these causes in its stride. It puts them with the story of a boxer who faced roadblocks from all directions – enough to get you riled up and thinking about all the wrongs in our society today. Yet, it let’s go of all the energy in the last hour by making the film a tad repetitive. 

                        This story is being told because the story ought to be told and not because *he* wants to tell the story.
                    
It is intense enough that you want a break from the aggressiveness of it all. However, the touch of humor and drama can be blamed for making that last hour feel like a bit of a stretch. Sure, some of the one-liners and situations make you laugh out loud and clap. And except for a couple of sequences where the background score pounds on till you realise that it is a dramatic moment, it adds value and pulses very well with the situations. But all of this takes your attention away from the story and disengages you a bit. 
So it is a balancing act between enjoying those sarcy but fun moments where the writers take a jab at Hindi films or a social situation and the intense familial or boxing stories. Individually, neither of these are striking enough to make you expect the unexpected. But collectively, you are constantly waiting for the worst to happen.

The edge is sharper because every time you think the situation is exaggerated you remember this is inspired from a true life story. And if newspaper headlines are to go by, reality must be so much more worse. This after all was a much stronger couple facing the tyrannical uncle or the toxic boss. And they had support from other family members and coaches. What must meeker personalities with little or no support go through?
While you don’t completely feel the pain because of the treatment, this empathy gets full backing from the performances. You hate the Bareilly coach, Bhagwan more because of Jimmy Shergill’s oft-repeated yet menacing body language. You take to Shravan’s grit and Sunaina’s firm boldness because of Vineet Kumar Singh and Zoya Hussain. You cheer Shravan when he intimidates an oppressor because of the actor’s perfect depiction of a small-time bureaucrat. 



You can’t think of this bureaucrat without thinking of the caste conflict brought out between Shravan’s boss and him is subtle yet powerful especially when compared to the blatant casteism that Bhagwan flaunts. Similarly, feminism takes a subtle flavour through Shravan and Sunaina’s relationship.
These are things you have come to expect in Anurag Kashyap films. And yet, Mukkabaaz is different because it feels like the director is finally out of the zone where he wants to make a point. This story is being told because the story ought to be told and not because he wants to tell the story. 

                        The touch of humor and drama can be blamed for making that last hour feel like a bit of a stretch
                    
This could also be why Mukkabaaz feels a little underwhelming. It has some great lines but it doesn’t have solid punch-lines. It has great writing but the writing doesn’t wear it’s political, social opinion on its sleeves. It has decent execution but the focus is on the narrative rather than style. Not that punch-lines, strong opinions or style was ever unenjoyable in Kashyap films, it’s just that here they are conspicuous by their absence – in a good way. It is nice to see a departure from the usual, even if it doesn’t completely work.

It isn’t a high funda picture on the problems of a boxer in India, it’s a throughly entertaining masala movie which you can enjoy and reflect upon. It could have been half an hour  to 20 minutes shorter because Anurag does get carried away in the narration of his characters. But you can safely put your money on this one and watch it raking prestigious honours if the antibodies don’t take offence to the real picture of our country that’s shown in the movie.

Kishan, with those great hurt eyes of his, is wonderful as well; why he’s cast so seldom in good Hindi films is a mystery. Sheirgill, through no fault of his own, is less memorable: the one-note antagonist he’s playing has nothing to do except escalate his villainy. There’s a brief period in the second half when the film seems to run out of ideas, yet even here Kashyap finds a detail, a scene, something to tide the audience by – like when Shravan decides to get unreasonably mad at his friend for using “doubtless” in a sentence.
