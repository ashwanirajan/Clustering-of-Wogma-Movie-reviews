
The very premise induces cringes in plenty – why are young men asked to treat all the young women around them as sisters? Sure, the issue of honor killing is touched upon, but it seems more as an after thought, when the writers realised that the premise is not virtuous enough to hold ground for an otherwise done-to-death “family vs. lovers” theme.

                        That no man really wants to treat women around him as sisters sounds more like a frustrated rant of a many-year-old, suppressed angst.
                    
There is a certain freshness in how the logistics of certain situations are explained. For example, the lies that need to be told to get one's way. In fact, these logistics implicitly point to how well characters know each other. For example, the stories a character makes up to get the parents to behave in a certain way. Both these aspects are rare in films and even more so because it is executed using the “show, don't tell” rule. There is some snappy dialogue to support this through too.
But this goodness lasts only a few scenes and is washed away with other sequences. In contrast, some scenes are just too superficial to make any sense. And a few others are replete with exaggeration.

None of the characters require any real out-of-the-world acting. The performers just need to not go overboard and that they manage – more or less. 
Given the one line plot of a love story that is as standard as it gets, it boiled down to the angle this particular premise takes on the plot. That no man really wants to treat women around him as sisters sounds more like a frustrated rant of a many-year-old, suppressed angst. Now, would that motivate you to watch the film?

        ...Behen Hogi Teri may not be as funny as the trailer has promised us, thanks to a sluggish second half and weak female characters. Nevertheless, it is still an entertaining watch, with all due credit to Rajkummar Rao’s terrific performance, a great supporting cast and some really funny scenes. It may not be the comedy of the year, but Behen Hogi Teri doesn’t end up being a decent time pass flick, that you can surely enjoy if you can overlook the flaws.

While it doesn't do anything wrong, except may be make it's lead man a bit too much of a coward, it also doesn't ever break free from the feeling of familiarity. Like countless romantic comedies before, this film just feels like another romantic film made on a template. Perfectly average, nothing special.

It has so many things going in its favor – great performances, a premise that's straight out of life and a small town setting. But there's too much confusion and misunderstandings in the second half that should have brought the house down. Instead, it leaves the audiences dazed.

If they were, No Entry would be shunned for objectifying women and Thank You would be banned for making light of domestic abuse. So, leave your brains and other organs at home and take your SO for this date film before you're pronounced man and behen.

The trouble is this is neither a satire nor a dark comedy. It doesn’t even have great performances to keep your interest alive throughout. By adding many stereotypes, it hammers its point. The end result is disappointing.
