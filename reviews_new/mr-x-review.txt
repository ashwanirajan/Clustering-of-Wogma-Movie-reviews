A Bhatt film starring Emraan Hashmi can pique your interest only so much. After what we can call a typical start to a Bhatt-thriller, comes the typical death and inevitable resurrection/revival. The mumbo-jumbo is different, but outcome typical. What is atypical though is the resolution. It makes you sit up and notice, if you have been paying attention thus far, that is.

It doesn't help that the actors all seem to be going through the motions rather than emotions. It must be said though that the lead lady's character gets a bit more to do here than your typical film in this genre. 
The story winds and unwinds way too much in the second half. It is almost as if the intriguing climax was the goal. The events leading up to it had to be convincing given the maze of characters and their motivations. So, whatever it took to get to that end given the constraints was done. 
On the way you have some decent use of CGI, though I'd have liked to see it in 2D. The prosthetics are pretty awful, the kind that makes you laugh rather than gross you out. 
At the end, I was a little surprised and a little disappointed. Given the dilemma and the conclusion thereof, the concept deserved better screenplay and writing. Should I be happy then that there seems to be a series on the way? ;)

The film's music (Jeet Ganguly, Ankit Tiwari) lacks any hit or hummable songs. It's the film's background music (Raju Singh) that manages to hold the film. While the film's cinematography (Pravin Bhatt) is decent, its editing (Kuldeep Mehan) is average. ...

An important takeaway from the film: Workplace romances are doomed, and will more often than not, get you into trouble. The story is very predictable, but there aren't really those moments when you feel why the film doesn't end. Two for the film, and a half extra for Hashmi. Watch it for Emraan Hashmi...baaki ki chinta chhodo....

Unfortunately Bhatt believes in rendering films with heart stopping seriousness. The net result is a film that’s awful enough to make you remember Tushar Kapoor’s gem Gaayab as a work of art....
