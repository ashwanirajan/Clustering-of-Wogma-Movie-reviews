
In its leap to address a range of social issues, Secret Superstar becomes lengthy and does so at a slow pace. Inevitably, the story goes all over the place. Many a time, slow films allow you to absorb the characters and situations. Here however, the pace is used to add another song, or establish an already well-established point about the characters' relationship dynamics. 

                        Unfortunately it doesn't trust us to unveil that take-away for ourselves.
                    
These things neither expose the characters nor the situations any further. This also makes Secret Superstar a little too repetitive. There are a couple of scenes which require the drama for the point to register. Especially one long-drawn sequence where the tension in the home is building up with the father clearly getting angrier by the second. You as an audience are holding your muscles tight because you see the mother has no way out and he is going to beat her up. But, barring a couple of such scenes, there is no real reason for situations to be repeated.  Interestingly, things that ought to have taken time, such as rise of popularity on social media, happen in a jiffy (if only publicising on social media were so easy!) Similarly, the establishment of rapport between Insia (Zaira Wasim) and Shakti Kumar (Aamir Khan) is all too quick. So, the pace is uneven too making the film drastically unrealistic, especially in comparison with how it begins. 
This is not to say that it doesn't get you emotional or your eyes don't dampen or a lump doesn't swell in your throat. All that happens. But, that is more because of how desperate Insia and her mother's situation is. Also, even though the depiction is far away from reality the stories of domestic violence and female foeticide are as close to reality as a flossy, Diwali release can allow.  I wonder if that is the makers' excuse for the airport scene as pre-climax and then the dreaded, predictable climax.

Along with these issues, the movie also comments on the reality show craze, industry awards, the change in the Hindi movie music industry and of course the relentless sacrifices that are expected out of you for being a woman and a mother. Then of course, there is the whole, 'chase your dream' spiel. These are all important issues, but that importance is subdued because of the way they were put together. Thankfully, there is no major speech. The “quotoble quote” knowledge comes, in bits and pieces, as one or two liner philosophies – nothing intolerable.
Of all these issues, female foeticide stuck with me. Not because of the overt story, but through the age gap between Insia and her little brother. I am glad the makers decided not to spell it out. 



But this subtlety is reserved for just this one case. Else the movie is annoyingly melodramatic and in-the-face. For instance, Shakti Kumar's arrogance had to reek from every scene that he was in, even the ones in which he is supposedly accepting his flaw. Similarly, Insia's character is also written with the intention of making her look and sound innocent – in every single frame. 
It is Zaira Wasim whose performances is so rooted, that even the most ridiculous things she is made to do, look possible. Hand-in-hand is Meher Vij as her mother. It is difficult to believe she can be anything other than a submissive woman who is beaten up by her husband (Arun Raj). That you feel like slapping Arun Raj, every time he appears on screen, says he has done his job all to well. Tirth Sharma as Insia's friend and Kabir Sheikh as her brother are age-appropriate adorable. That leaves Aamir Khan and I am so glad that Aamir Khan is left in a supporting role and makes a relatively prominent appearance only in the second half. Even so, his character felt over-written and over-done – after discounting for the fact that it was absolutely intentional. Once you kind-of settle in for the character he is portraying though, he manages to bring a smile out of you. 

                        This is not to say that it doesn't get you emotional or your eyes don't dampen or a lump doesn't swell in your throat. All that happens. But...
                    
That is the film's only attempt at trying to make things light. Otherwise, the film is a pretty serious take on every issue it brings up. Unfortunately, even as a movie about a singer, the music is not extraordinary. However, the lyrics are great. This again might have been intentional, so that the focus moves from music to lyrics. 
Secret Superstar tries to do these things but it doesn't entirely work out for the film. It wants to reach out to the secret superstar within us or recognise the secret superstars around us. But, unfortunately it doesn't trust us to unveil that take-away for ourselves. It insists on spelling it out. While doing so, it takes on way too many issues on its shoulders, not doing complete justice to the three core issues it truly wants to address – domestic violence, female foeticide, and  that one ought to follow their dreams. That leaves the film neither here nor there and way too long.
