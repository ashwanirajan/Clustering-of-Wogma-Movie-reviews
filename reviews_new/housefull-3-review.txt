
Someone I know read out a forwarded joke with full enthusiasm, “Listen to this one, it is hilarious! Why do chickens sit on eggs? Because they don't have chairs.”  I am stumped trying to figure out why this is funny. “How do they even think of this stuff!? Hats off to their brains!”, she goes on. I refrain from trying to point out that chickens don't sit on eggs. That is exactly the kind of humor Housefull 3 carries. It doesn't make you laugh much but you are dumbstruck thinking about the process which might have brought out the joke – the overall plot, the situations, the puns, the slapstick, everything. That awe takes the edge off the torture but there is enough in the form of regressive concepts, racism, sexism and other forms of insensitivity that you would rather avoid.

The two main types of humor that Housefull 3 banks on are the forwarded variety or the kind that are with the intention of being insensitive. There is a third type in the form of performances, but of the lot only Akshay Kumar puts in all his energy. While it still didn't make me laugh, he was doing a lot more than just contorting his face. Of course, he was the only one who had a character with scope for doing more. Abhishek Bachchan and Riteish Deshmukh don't really have much to make their characters look or feel different from each other. Boman Irani too is the typical loud character you would find in every slapstick.
Similarly, the ladies Jacqueline Fernandez, Lisa Haydon and Nargis Fakhri play the regular props who are supposed to make us differentiate between cultured and uncultured women by their attire. Oh well.



Actually I got one good laugh. It was a real hoot to see how self-aware the film-makers are. They actually included a scene that confesses and apologizes for all that is wrong about the film. It is always funny when people know that what they are doing is wrong and go ahead and do it anyway.
As far as the story goes, it is hard to say whether there was some method to the silliness or we have gotten used to it so much that it seems like the new normal. Just a different shade of intolerable.

Yet, it is the best film of the franchise (not that there is much to aim there…), as it is far more entertaining and funnier than its predecessors. Go for it, if you like mindless entertainers, and I am sure you will not be disappointed!

The film is a madcap entertainer which delivers guffaws, belly laughs and over-the-top slapstick humour in gigantic proportion. The film however is bound to get diverse reactions from the audiences. If you admire and relish these entertainers, and are passionate about cinema of this variety, then HOUSEFULL 3 is definitely a stress buster for you. Else, you can stay away from this. At the Box-Office, HOUSEFULL 3 will appeal only to the masses, the aam aadmi, who relish hardcore masala movies.

Here would like to add, that we all love to see Akshay featuring in these mindless comedies too using his impeccable comic timing widely known to all. But dancing to such awfully degraded lyrics………….. really hurts a lot!

The confounding script gets it even more complicated by inserting Urja Nagre (Jackie Shroff) a former underworld Don who appears to have a personal interest in the future of the three belles. And there’s Chunky Pandey rehashing his Aakhri Pasta with so much cheese that it grates on your nerves. The jokes and slap-stick are of the repetitive variety- the kind you have read on the internet/social media time and again.

It's as if its makers want you to know that they have spent a lot on the actresses' make-up and skimpy wardrobe, the locations and the ghastly songs with innumerable extras. The humour is crass -it's oh-so-hilarious to rob young women of the ability to have kids. The move of suddenly turning overtly serious doesn't work neither do the puns. The slapstick humour is only exhausting and not engaging one bit.  Of the cast, the one who occasionally manages to pull off the ridiculousness is Akshay Kumar. It isn't a good sign at all that for a film that proclaims to be a comedy that the audience spends most of it in pin-drop silence. ...

The replacements — a certain director duo called Sajid-Farhad, do what any substitute would — play up the format's signature sequences, marginalise Chunky Pandey and hope for a miracle.
