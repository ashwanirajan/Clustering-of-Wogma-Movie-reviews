Subtle unexpected satire
✔



Makes you laugh
✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ 
that's for the 4 jokes


Comic timing
✔ ✔ ✔ ✔
not the actor's fault that there were only 4 funny lines!


3 peppy item numbers
✔ ✔ ✔ 
for accepting that none of the cast members have the x-factor. By the way why weren't there 4 item numbers?


1 song with adorable lyrics

the "ik rupaiya" song 


BUT and a big BUT  (just incase you didn’t notice)


Loud

Sermons

Actually, there is only 1 but it felt like 3 sermons and 2 extra ✔ for how crappy that 1 was 


Random bottom-up camera angles.
Camera doing the dancing instead of Rakhee Sawant

 Yep, that's a negative!
