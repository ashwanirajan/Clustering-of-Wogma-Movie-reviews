
Of course, Padman is about a man who cared for the well-being of his wife and sisters. But it would be unfair to think of Padman as just a “period” film. It is as much about rural India, superstitious India, an India that finds breaking away from tradition worse than a death sentence. And I am sure this is true of many countries, not just this one. Societies with families that find it difficult to finance basic needs, but spend that and more on faith – must surely exist outside India too. So even as Padman is about changing the way in which women manage their menstrual flow, it’s reach is far beyond the boundary of this country and the topic of menstruation. 

                        I was waiting for Akshay Kumar to burst into a know-it-all, holier-than-thou monologue. But thankfully, they ducked that one.
                    
I am glad that Arunachalam Muruganantham took up the onus of making affordable sanitary napkins. I am certainly glad there are being films made on the man, his zeal, his persistence, and his invention. And I am equally glad that it got star-backing from Akshay Kumar in Padman. Let alone boys and men, if the film changes the attitude of even a handful of girls and women towards menstruation from the “hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil” to that of, “baah, what’s the big deal”, it is a success – irrespective of box office status. Yes, there are women today who speak about periods much more liberally than when I was growing up. But we are hardly enough. This shocking indicator cannot be repeated enough – only 12% of Indian women use sanitary napkins. 
As far as the film goes, you can tell that the writing and direction are trying very hard to keep things light. Be it Laxmikant’s (Akshay Kumar) sense of humor or Sonam Kapoor’s bright smile and breezy presence. If that’s what it takes to reach a larger audience, so be it.

I was caught off-guard by Akshay Kumar’s performance. From the beginning, he just came across as the simple-minded, progressive villager he is supposed to be. Sonam Kapoor as Pari, Laxmikan’t enterprise partner, fit in well too. In contrast though, Radhika Apte (Laxmikant’s wife) looked a little out of place. Her shame, her helplessness, her concern for the family budget all came across as rather functional, if not superficial. 
This though is not the actor’s fault. She isn’t the focus of the writing. Neither is Laxmikant. Sure, the other characters are all in relation to him, as in his wife, his partner, his friend, his mother, his sisters, yet he is not the focus. The focus is clearly the story, or to take it a level further – the invention and the social milieu that called for the invention. From financial deprivation to money-and-fame driven attitude, from societal pressure of what’s appropriate and what’s not to a take on faith and religion – everything in Padman revolves around the invention. So, even though the film points at all these issues, it is still a lot about how to make an affordable sanitary napkin, to the extent that at some point I felt like I am taking a repeated, factory tour of a sanitary napkin machine shop. This did get a little repetitive and tedious after a while. And of course, for a film that addresses social taboo around menstruation, it defeated the purpose that “the stain” was still taboo. That’s when you remind yourself that, that’s real life. Despite these issues though, it is good to see this tender, caring, determined man’s road to discovery. 



I am not sure the extent to which the film sticks to the events of the true life story, but from this TED talk by Arunachalam Muruganantham, the first half looks like it has largely stuck to actuals. Of course, there is the unfathomable move from Tamil Nadu to Madhya Pradesh. Maybe it was to keep things politically correct, who knows? The love angle is another question mark the film left me with. The especially broken English that Laxmikant delivers his speech in, is another one of those cinematic liberties that the film could have done without. Instead it would have been a nice touch to show how the man was approached for the film. But, I guess that would be called chest-thumping. It’s amusing that a film that revolves around the social fatigue of “what will people say?” can’t show a bit of reality because of “what people will say”.
On the other hand, Padman has refrained from some common Hindi film traps. For instance, from 20 minutes into the film, I was waiting for Akshay Kumar to burst into a know-it-all, holier-than-thou monologue. But thankfully, they ducked that one. I guess, it helps that real life isn’t about preachy speeches. 

                        The focus is clearly the story, or to take it a level further – the invention and the social milieu that called for the invention.
                    
As with many films based on true-lives, especially those that inspire and have a social cause at the core – it is difficult to separate the cause and the personality from the film. And thus comes the inevitable question – is it enough for us to know about such a life? Or has the film been able to take the public discourse a step further? Will my teenage son and daughter talk more openly about periods with each other; with their friends of the opposite gender? Are they more sensitized? Will you and I consider giving our domestic help a pack of the ironically named “Whisper” with their salary? Will we hide the pack as we give it? Does it cross social boundaries if you almost force them to talk about periods uninhibitedly as we would have our kids talk? This last question, I am sure, is for another film.

R Balki has made a film that not only entertains but also educates the people. It is neither too preachy like Toilet: Ek Prem Katha nor overtly dramatic like PK. The only glitch is the unneeded romantic plot which could have been avoided (won’t spoil it for you). The film is a perfect ode to empowering women which will, in turn, empower India.
