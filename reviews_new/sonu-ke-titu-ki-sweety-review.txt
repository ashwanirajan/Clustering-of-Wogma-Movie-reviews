
Possessive friend becomes manipulative because his friend’s fiancée is a schemer and manipulative. Why she is manipulative? Your guess is as good as mine. It ought to be enough for us that the possessive friend thinks so. The resultant back and forth between the friend and the fiancée are just about interesting. But they become repetitive and tiring. 

                        the writing is just happy sticking to what it has built on in previous films.
                    
To begin with the premise of characters manipulating their friends and significant others is not very engaging. It is not that I don’t know that manipulative people exist in the real world. I am sure they do. It’s just that, I don’t find their stories interesting. Once you figure that this character can go to any extent to get their way, they become predictable. 
Of course, to the extent that you are already in the theater watching the film, and we don’t know what they are going to do next, you are interested in finding out. But that bit of curiosity is also dealt with ‘meh’ twists. It doesn’t help here that you can predict the film-making. At least 7-8 times in the second half, I caught myself thinking, “now, she is going to make that eye gesture that says she is unfazed and has a smart move up her sleeve” or “now, he is going to look at her from that mirror” or “don’t tell me they are going to look at each other with that smug smile as if no one else is watching” or “please-please-please don’t make her wink with a death-stare in slow-motion in the next scene”. And that is exactly what happened. To the word.

Predictability to the shot level makes the film have a Hindi TV serial like quality. Not to mention the petty, dining table politics. This and the thick woman-bashing attitude of Luv Ranjan’s film is getting tiring. I tried very hard to treat it as just a story between two friends and one’s significant other. But, the flavour seemed to be especially anti-woman. I even tried to give it the benefit of doubt, that maybe it was their style of satire. But, so deep is the regressive attitude that the filmmakers seem oblivious and ignorant of the stereotyping. 
There was this one shot in a party song, one of the guys goes to this woman who he has presumably met for the first time. She is wearing glasses. He takes those glasses off and gestures that she is looking nice. There’s something inherently creepy about this. And this is our protagonist, who we are supposed to like?



At this point, I think I am putting more thought into the writing than the writers ever intended to. Because the characters are of course uni-dimensional. But, you see only one aspect of their single dimension too. Sonu (Kartik Aaryan) is annoyingly know-it-all. Titu (Sunny Singh Nijjar) is naive and dumb. We know this about Sonu and Titu only from one aspect of their lives – Sonu’s girlfriend, Sweety (Nushrat Bharucha). Sweety on the other hand, is interested in making sure Sonu doesn’t succeed in getting her out of Titu’s life. 
Now, why she wants what she wants seems to be irrelevant. In that sense, the entire film seems to have no rhyme or reason. The very premise of the film is suspicion about Sweety’s intentions and we are pretty much asked to take that basis for suspicion for granted. For what the film purports, she would have to be playing a long, long game like a professional con artist. 

                        please-please-please don’t make her wink with a death-stare in slow-motion in the next scene
                    
In that sense, the writing is just happy sticking to what it has built on in previous films. Since no Luv Ranjan rom-com can come without a Kartik Aryan monologue and they don’t want it to become repetitive, he takes off right at the beginning but it’s not about women. So, much for creativity. It is amusing when the writer actually has Sonu admire the writing by repeating how smartly the previous scene was written. You know, just in case the audience didn’t notice. Only that it was not. 
The actors do what we are used to seeing them do. Except for Alok Nath, who plays a quirky, adorable, and a not-so-sanskari grandfather. It was a joy to watch him so. But that doesn’t mean his track in the film belonged. 
While focused on the ‘friend’ versus ‘girl’ competition, Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety also has these extraneous tracks that unnecessarily lengthen the film. Considering the central track is run-down and annoying by the writer-director’s own standards, that leaves very little in the ‘watchable’ category.

After all "I don't take care of you? Am I not enough? What she gives I cannot?" are not lines that a man tells his male friend routinely. There is innuendo here that cannot be dismissed. That's a film we'd watch.
