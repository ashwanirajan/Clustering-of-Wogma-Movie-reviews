
The philosophy that revenge is making an aware choice between evil and worse evil is not new. It almost sanctions evil as the right thing to do. There are no surprises there. Yet, Mom as a revenge movie is engaging. To make an engaging movie out of a not-so-engaging story is quite a mean feat.

                        While the overall plot is as run-of-the-mill as the next revenge thriller, some subtleties are done really well.
                    
In fact, Mom is so predictable that if you put the trailer and the theme together you can predict the climax a good half an hour before it begins, if not even earlier. “How” it happens has a twist and the challenges that come in the way are unexpected, but that is not what keeps you hooked. Also, the pace is not swift so you are not really at the edge of your seat. The moments stall more to let you soak the emotion in, rather than to create suspense.
This emotion I think is what keeps you from getting bored. The parents' sorrow and frustration is apparent yet not once goes over-the-top. Maybe because every time my teenage daughter steps out of the house alone, the tiny nag at the back of my mind doesn't relent, till she's back – it is easier for me to get involved in the film. Maybe because though I can't put myself for a moment in Devki's (Sri Devi) place, I find my comfort in only sympathising with her – I feel like I would have engaged even more had the topic not been so close to reality.

That is the power of the performances. Adnan Siddiqui, Akshaye Khanna, Abhimanyu Singh all play their part without getting in the way of the story. Interestingly on Nawazuddin Siddqui as DK seemed a little out of place because the character is quirky – slightly away from the tone of the film.  Both Sridevi and Sajal Ali bawl their eyes out without a decibel seeming out of place. Even as I child I had to work hard on ignoring Sridevi's accent. It didn't help that the roles she played in those times required her to overact. Here, she is in control and the script supports her restraint.
While the overall plot is as run-of-the-mill as the next revenge thriller, some subtleties are done really well. For instance, the role reversal in genders before and after are such subtle examples of sexism. Not the kind that we can blame movies for. The kind we appreciate in movies because that's how a day in the life of a typical woman is in real life.



I don't know if Mom could have been a better film if the writing were tighter. Its pauses had a reason that might not be in line with that of a thriller. I don't know if Mom could have been a better film if the writing at least tried to be unpredictable. What I know is I will look forward to director, Ravi Udyawar's next work. I wouldn't mind watching more films written by him, Girish Kohli or Kona Venkat Rao. I certainly want to watch the next Sridevi film, something that I couldn't imagine saying 25-30 years ago. That is good enough.

        ...The tense atmosphere is also greatly down to the music, provided by industry-veteran A. R. Rahman who has composed over 150 film scores over his 25 year career. If you think that you’ve not heard his work before then you’re probably not taking into account such global hits as Slumdog Millionaire and 127 Hours. His score for MOM is yet another example of how this film shows a polish and slickness with its production that you might expect from a Hollywood film, except this was made on a much smaller budget.

However, it trades in thematic complexity for that as it works on elevating itself from the run-of-the-mill vengeance dramas. I'm treading some delicate waters here, but one has to consider the fact that the audience's intelligence has risen several notches, and a predictable tale of good vs. evil with a hefty dose of flavor-of-the-month feminism thrown into the mix doesn't move the dial on the quality metre as it did in Sridevi's heyday.

Violence: Entire movie is based on rape and revenge
Language: Clean
Nudity & Sexual content: Rape is implied and not explicitly shown
Concept: Revenge = choosing between evil and worse evil.
General Look and Feel: It has a grim, grayness about it. Slight lightness brought about by Nawazuddin Siddiqui's character, else slow and dry.
