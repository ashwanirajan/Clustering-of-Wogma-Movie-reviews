
Like the trailer promised, Tanu Weds Manu meets Bajrangi Bhaijaan. We get a bonus! Wake Up Sid. But what didn't expect was it would become a Housefull. However, somewhere along the way, it has a few wonderful laughs that keep it light and breezy.

Sure, Happy Bhag Jayegi has all the trappings of a typical romcom, that goes for the “chaotic lie-after-lie” brand of comedy. But some of its one-liners and situations make you giggle at the silliness. Surprisingly, there is some subtle humor too. 
Also, unexpected is the social commentary on parental pressure in the form of a parallel thread. Bilal Ahmed's (Abhay Deol) track grows on the side almost unnoticed. Only, when the other characters talk about it,do you realise that it is a major part of the film. While each individual element of the story, the romance, the comedy, the politics, the social message are beaten to death in films, this mixture kind of works. The last bit slapped on, in the form of slapstick, ruins it all. 



It is the things that you don't expect Happy Bhag Jayegi to do that make the film enjoyable. Some of the humor aside, they named a character Afridi and did not take potshots at the Pakistani cricketer! That must have required some restraint. 
What's more, Bilal's wife (Momal Sheikh) who could have been the stereotypical vamp, is constrained in her reactions and in fact very human. The performances were all convincing and entertaining. The comic timing, the littlest of change in body and facial expressions, were thoroughly enjoyable. It is quite an achievement for Jimmy Sheirgill to play the guy who always loses his bride-to-be, and yet be entertaining all over again.
The music is good too. The songs for once don't seem intrusive, even if the background music weirdly guides you to laugh and stop. It is the chaos in end that just gets to you and brings the film crumbling down. It is as if you can see the writer's struggle with what they really want – a situational sense of humor verus what they think the audience wants – a slapstick.

        ...Surprisingly an element of gravity is introduced mid-way when the narrative sneaks in a telling contrast in the relationships that Bilal and Guddu share with their respective life-mates. Director Mudassar Aziz explores the anatomy of commitment and honesty in a relationship without squandering away the spirit of satire that streams across this endearing rom-com. He also makes gentle comments through Piyush Mishra on how much of India and Pakistan is shared experience.

Diana Penty has improved a lot from her debut film, Cocktail, though you might see shades of Jab We Met’s Geet in her character. Abhay Deol is fine as the young politician, who would rather be a cricketer. Ali Fazal and Jimmy Sheirgill are also adequate in their roles. However, it’s Piyush Mishra who is the best of the lot, as most of his dialogues hit the bullseye. Let’s hope that the second half keeps up the mirth of the first half.

Clichéd and contrived situations abound and the narrative begins overreaching into the farfetched and absurd.  Abhay Deol and Jimmy Shergill are the performers here while Diana Penty, Ali Zafar, Momal Sheikh and the rest do a fair job. The real problem with the film though is that the characters and their motivations aren’t believable. So while you can enjoy the brief bursts of situational humour there’s no lasting impression left behind.

Penty, who’s had an even longer gap since her 2012 debut in Cocktail, enlivens her somewhat prototypal “force of nature” role with comic energy and a surprising warmth. Sheirgill is fast turning into one of Hindi cinema’s great sad sacks, and Mishra into one of its finest mutterers. Their collective enthusiasm renders the film’s lack of subtlety endearing and its gaps in narrative logic inconsequential. I’m having a hard time remembering the last time I watched a Hindi film this silly but still found myself laughing.
