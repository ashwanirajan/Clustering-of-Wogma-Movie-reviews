
Phas Gaye Re Obama absolutely delivers on the sarcastic wit that the title implies. Satire runs in every dialogue and situation of the film. Unfortunately though, alongside the smart quips is also the oh-so-unnecessary slapstick. What could have been a classy comedy becomes yet another toilet-humor fest.

It is brilliant, however, that despite going the crude route every once in a while, the story doesn't shift focus from its basic plot. A slapstic comedy with focus - now isn't that a relief. In fact, there is a point in the latter half where I'm wondering how is Shastri (Rajat Kapoor) going to get out of this? I love it when the writer or director makes me think on his behalf. He has me hooked, irrespective of whether or not I'm enjoying his film. 
Of course, a film like this wouldn't achieve half of what it aims to if the actors aren't capable of getting their timing right. Here, Sanjay Mishra, and the actor who plays Anni (Manu Rishi?) are just brilliant. Who would've thought that a movie would stand tall on their shoulders? That too, with Rajat Kapoor and Neha Dhupia around, in terms of "star-value". Both of them have forced dialogue delivery and Neha Dhupia's character is too stylized. Also, the feminism her character portrays is tasteless. 
Yet, a person who enjoys slapstick is certainly going to enjoy Phas Gaye Re Obama much more than I did. So, a light, Sunday afternoon watch it is.
