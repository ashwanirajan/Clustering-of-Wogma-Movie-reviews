
In their childhood, boy sees girl and girl sees boy. Love at first sight happens. They part as soon as they meet. Years later guess what happens? How is this even a story? How is the story of this character legendary? I very consciously try not to say this about any film, but I am so close to asking - why is “The Legend of Michael Mishra” even a movie?
Love stories in which the protagonists go to extremes to prove their love are common enough. Love stories in which the hero thinks he is going to an extreme when he isn't really, can only get your eyes to roll. Top it off with lame dialogue and average performances and there is barely anything to appreciate about it. 
The Legend of Michael Mishra has no substance what so ever, which is alright, right? We are used to films with no substance. Well, this one has no form either.

        ...However, sadly enough, a film cannot rely on just one magnificent twist in the tale if the story revolving around is it not up to the mark and this is what The Legend Of Michal Mishra suffers from. The lackluster performances, the pallid humour, the numerous and unnecessary songs contribute to making The Legend Of Michael Mishra a very average fare.

The point-of-view here is entirely ridiculous. It’s so obvious and blatantly compromised that you will see the eventual outcome coming from a mile. Aditi Rao Hydari does her valiant best to rouse up some interest but it’s just not happening!...

The songs here aren't just superfluous they are ridiculously banal, most of which Aditi Rao Hydari has the misfortune to perform to. Boman Irani's job is to narrate Mishra's legend to a bunch of tourists. Warsi's desperate attempts at being a larger-than-life hero with a sense of humour are in vain for the script is insipid and utterly devoid of fun. Kayoze Irani is the sidekick who instead of providing comic relief is a source of constant annoyance with his OTT antics...

Warsi as an overgrown lover boy hams his way through the film, while Irani Sr and Jr go about their supposedly fun roles to lighten up the scenario, but in vain. Aditi appears to be in a perpetual state of discomfort. Warsi and Irani are known for their comic timing, but
are sadly wasted in this one. This legend is certain to be doomed....

His bloodshot eyes well up, his nose bleeds and he soon requires medical attention. What his character goes through in that scene best summarises the experience of watching this film.

Some Groucho Marx masks may have been worn by the characters in a couple of the scenes in the film but that doesn’t lend the film any of Marx’s crackling humour.

The film's extras come across like they were hired from the streets without any prior acting experience. Aditi Rao Hydari's good looks is the only good thing about this amateurish attempt, masquerading as a feature film, aimed for adults. Don't know about 'Legend' but this insipid film ijj epic fail for sure....
