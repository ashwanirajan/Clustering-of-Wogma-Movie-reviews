
Most underworld-crime based films more or less have to circle around the "vanity of vengeance". With an audience that mostly doesn't belong to the world from where the characters of the film come, the story writers pretty much don't have a choice. And yet, through this situation the writers here have made the going as interesting as possible. Building characters along the way. Creating situations for unrest at regular intervals.

The pre-requisite for a crime-based action film is a swift pace and that is one thing Baabarr doesn't lack. There's always something happening and one situation leads to another in a clean and clear flow. And so is the flow of the "boom-dishum-bang-dhickyau". The gun-mania just won't take a rest. As if the little boy just found a new toy. 
I'm not easily disturbed by violence, but Baabarr in Hindi cinema takes it to a new level. There was one scene in which I actually felt sick in my stomach. And what can I say you can count the number of non-violent scenes on your fingers. And even in those scenes the dialogue is about the violence that took place or was going to take place. 
Yet, it's not like the characters haven't been worked upon. Each type of characters have traits that stay consistent and comply with the boundaries set for them. Thus adding to the believability. They were given decent dialogues too. Though all characters, most of the time, have to either scare or get scared, there's not much wrong with the acting department. Except for maybe Mithun Chakroborty who just can't seem to keep the actor's style out of the character. 
Also the grainy texture adds to the "realistic" feel of the film. The handheld, jerky camera is put to use almost continuously, but there is chaos and tension throughout the movie too. One refreshing aspect is that the backdrop is neither Mumbai nor Hindi cinema's favorite Punjab. They've also tucked in tributes to presumed inspirations like The Godfather and Satya. But, it would be only a shock if they didn't do that. 
We see 5, maybe even 10 films, based on some underworld concept every year. The storyline can only be so much different. The only basis for watching one and not another could be something different tried in the build-up towards the climax. Baabar has a couple of vexing situations but that's about it. And besides the excessive gore this isn't much of a variant from other crime-related fields.

BAABARR is the story of crime set with Lucknow as the backdrop. It is also the story of how crime is nurtured for political gains; how vote banks are developed and protected and of the good cop and bad cop.

Shot in the by lanes of Uttar Pradesh, this crime fest is loaded with gunshots and dead bodies. You lose count after the first reel. It is also the story of a 12-year-old boy who fires his first shot to save his brothers from being killed. There on, at age 22, he roams the streets fearlessly, protecting those who pay their ?protection fee' and eliminating those who refuse.

As expected, there is violence galore. But our hero Baabarr (newcomer Soham Shah) looks more a lover boy than a killing machine. There is no meanness in his eyes and his body language is that of a teenager who has just set his hands on a revolver; not that of a seasoned killer. Though heavily bearded, he is allowed to enter a school dressed in a uniform. He is there to assassinate the Chief Minister's brother. At another instance, he dresses up as the groom and sits besides the bride's father! Even when he is shot from a point-blank range with the gun placed at his temple, he survives with a scratch on his cheek. What cheek!

Though Soham has a screen presence, his choice to play the lead was a bad one. In fact, Tabrez, Baabaar's rival, portrayed menacingly by Sushant Singh has enough fire in him to give Soham a complex.

There are also shots of Baabarr's elder brother Sarfaraz (Shakti Kapoor) making frantic calls to a Mayawati lookalike from his prison cell when Baabarr has been captured. What one cannot understand is how Sarfaraz became so powerful in prison. He was sent to jail when Baabarr was 12 years old. Sarfaraz then had accidentally killed a goon in a fight, which got out of hand.

Also, what one cannot understand is how the cops cannot capture Baabaar when they know his whereabouts. They keep chasing him, and missing him. The second half is all about this chase and miss, which takes whatever little sting, there is in the movie.

Mithun Chakraborty is S P Dwivedi who is given the task of capturing the dreaded criminal dead or alive. Om Puri is A N Chaturvedi a corrupt cop who feeds on the excesses of Baabarr and his brothers.

Coming out with all guns blazing is Zia (Urvashi Sharma), the criminal's girlfriend. Urvashi makes a solid statement with her limited role to create an impact of that of a seasoned performer. After NAQAAB, Urvashi proves once again that she is quite a natural when it comes to emoting a role.

Parental Guidance:


Violence: There are few rare moments without violence. And at times it is pretty graphic too
Language: On and off use of abusive language. The mannerism of speaking is violent though.
Nudity & Sexual content: None
Concept: Futility of revenge
General Look and Feel: Its dark and has a grainy structure with not much for children in it.
