
The thing about things unexpected is that you end up valuing them more than you really should. Like say the semblance of a plot about a missing 3-year old turning into something even more interesting. Baaghi 2 keeps you wondering about, “but why has the child been kidnapped?” through the film. In fact, you are waiting so long for the answer that you lose interest in it. And even worse, when you do come to know it all seems off-landish. Having said that, so little was my hope of being engaged or entertained by this film that I was surprised to find myself interested. 

                        maybe the makers are admitting that the character and/or the actor are not capable of holding our attention without this gimmickry
                    
Other than that externality though, Baaghi 2 has very little going for it. The action is aggressive and has lots of sound effects to make it seem more intense but is nothing you have not seen before or would miss if you haven’t seen it at all. 
The music is insipid and you sense a shudder down the spine as you watch the choreography team and Jacqueline Fernandez ruthlessly murder ‘ek do teen’. Haven’t songs that force themselves into the narrative, most of all item numbers, gone out of fashion yet? I didn’t if I ought to laugh or cry when Baaghi 2 was clearly at a point where there was no room for a song and had the protagonist go into a flashback to make room for a song. Sure, this particular song was weaved into the story but the jolt with which you are taken into the song makes that weaving lose the little credibility it has. All than I can do then is appreciate the attempt.

Speaking of things that ought to have never come into fashion, why are characters still being introduced in slo-mo? What is the point? How are additional tools to add drama to the narrative applicable at the beginning of the film, while introducing a character?
Anyway, maybe the makers are admitting that the character and/or the actor are not capable of holding our attention without this gimmickry. Which is evident when you see Tiger Shroff being earnest on screen and still not striking a chord or when you see Disha Patani on screen and wonder if you would know she is worried about a missing child had she not told you so repeatedly. Prateik Babbar’s act was unintentionally amusing. And while having Manoj Bajpai and Deepak Dobriyal is some consolance, it can hardly be fair to them. Randeep Hooda’s act is over-the-top and is yet another out-of-fashion element – the comic relief. 



It is difficult to fault some of these actors because while the plot elements are intriguing, the tiny details are uninteresting at times and at other times, they fall in the usual range of appalling casual sexism and pandering to popular views. 
That leaves me then with one question – why Baaghi? Not, why Baaghi 2? I wasn’t expecting to find that answer at all. But, why Baaghi at all? Where’s the rebel?

But since it chooses to go with the hero, therefore can strictly be seen if Tiger Shroff and the action are the only two key elements you are more interested in. However it does manage to gain some extra marks for both Randeep Hooda and Manoj Bajpai providing the entertainment in their scenes together.

Why Manoj Bajpayee would pick this film is a bigger mystery than the one in the film’s plot. Regardless, he manages to extend some dignity to his character. ...

Also, how Baaghi 2 uses its sole woman — yes that's right, there is only one woman in the film (Patani) — says much about what it wants to be. However, some credit must be given to Baaghi 2 for staying true to its genre. If you're a fan of high-action dramas, you may just (gasp!) enjoy this film. It's a pity the film didn't use Manoj Bajpayee and Randeep Hooda's expertise more; they are mere pawns in Tiger Shroff's journey. Now that's the real pity.
