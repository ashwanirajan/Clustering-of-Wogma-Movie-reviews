
As a bittersweet slice of life laid out in front of you, Ribbon is richly textured with performances, beautifully layered with content, and sprinkled with occasional humor. One bite, and you won't feel like leaving it unfinished. It is relishingly engaging. 

                        ...the movie made me forget my illness and engrossed me so much that I didn't even turn in my chair.
                    
Kalki Koechlin and Sumeet Vyas play an urban couple, Sahana and Karan, with such conviction that you can almost hear them think. Their kisses, tiffs, and struggle, carry the veracity of a couple's passion, despair and the need to sustain respectively. Their love for each other is palpable. And even though their courtship is not shown, their longstanding devoted relationship is apparent as the very spine of the story. 
Of course, there are numerous arguments, as may be evident from the trailer, but what's interesting is that all of them emanate from the larger issue of our conditioning and acceptance of gender roles, priorities, and discrimination thereof. Ribbon thus blends together the personal, the familial and the social milieus, and offers a rather thorough tasting of our times.

Kalki is so good in the role of today's urban woman, who demands equality in personal and professional life, that there are scenes where she easily reminds of yesteryears' Shabana Azmi. The film offers numerous instances where Kalki has proven her acumen without coming across as trained or repetitive. For example, scenes where she is feeling frustrated and defeated, yet struggling to not spoil the moment for those with her at that time, even at the cost of, say, thrusting a handful of French fries in her mouth to depict Sahana's stress coping mechanism. In all the variants of such a moment, you realize how well she has mastered the craft of effortlessly expressing transient emotions.
The good thing is that the entire ensemble cast is hugely, if not equally, talented and fulfill their part with utmost sincerity. As representatives of real-life individuals we are surrounded by, each character in the film is culpable yet unavoidable. They bring in relief as well as new conflicts. Each of them is thus gray, and hence real. The challenge for the more upright ones like Sahana is to find a way to coexist with such people and yet to hold her own. And Kalki makes Sahana do a fantastic job of it.



Direction-wise, the use of hand-held camera helps add to the overall realism of the script. Just like it did in Kapoor and Sons (2016), it helps break the fourth wall and plants you within a scene, makes you a part of it. And, that's probably also why the film is so engaging. You are not stationed on a comfy chair but move around the house, and everywhere else, with the characters. The briskness of physical movement helps you relate with a character's state so much more.
The craft of the director is most admirably evident in handling scenes with child actors. Their natural state is utilized well in the script and in their interactions with other actors. Thanks to this, child actors don't look like borrowed props.

                        Ribbon thus blends together the personal, the familial and the social milieus, and offers a rather thorough tasting of our times.
                    
Then from the editing point of view, the inclusion of details, even if they may momentarily feel unwanted, is commendable and additionally helps paint a pretty real picture. For example, the scene of safety drill at the construction site. Not cutting it out and letting it frame a phone conversation that Karan (Sumeet Vyas) has, is so important in understanding his context and in empathizing with his efforts.
In a nutshell, every cast and crew member seems to be focused on achieving a certain veracity, while keeping you involved. As a result, there is something so sublime about Ribbon's truthfulness that it made me sink in my chair and not blink. 
I had pre-booked a seat in an open-air theater but ended up falling terribly sick on the day. So, I prepared myself to walk out in the middle if I didn't find it too comfortable to sit under the sky. However, the movie made me forget my illness and engrossed me so much that I didn't even turn in my chair.  
PS: I couldn't pay much attention to the music, but a couple of songs that play in the background seem soothing. And they don't alter the pace of events in the movie. Thus non-intrusive.

For Vyas, Ribbon could prove to be a stepping stone to more such Bollywood openings.

Parental Guidance:


Violence: Spoken of, suggested, and mildly depicted, nothing graphic though
Language: Clean, except in a couple of scenes 
Nudity & Sexual content: A married couple makes out and although minimal nudity involved in depicting it, it is pretty erotic
Concept: The challenges of parenthood as faced by an urban couple, depicted with an acute awareness of subtle but widespread manifestations of gender inequality
General Look and Feel: Matter of fact, no intention to beautify anything than what it truly is; use of hand-held camera lets you into the scenes
