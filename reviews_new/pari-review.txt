
When the objective of the film is to make your gut wrench and evoke nausea, and it achieves in doing both, you would have to call it a success, right? In that sense, Pari works. Of course, this has to be taken with a pinch of salt because I am easy-to-scare in horror films.  But, why a movie has to be repulsive, even if for brief moments, to be terrify its audience, is beyond me.

                        One short moment in a morgue at the beginning of the film is enough for you to expect the worst through every moment of the film.
                    
For a horror film to work, the first thing that needs to go right, is the acting. Anushka Sharma and Parambrata Chatterjee play the duality perfectly. She is vulnerable, he is protective. She is fragile and needy, he is the provider. She is violent, he is thoroughly confused. Rajat Kapoor is rather effective in playing both good and evil simultaneously. On the other hand, Ritabhari Chakraborty’s act comes across as affected. 
Having largely crossed the first thing that goes wrong with a horror film, an Indian one at that, next comes the paraphernalia – the background music, the lighting, the camera angles, the prosthetics, the use of silence and so on. These too largely go well with the general sombre mood of the film. Sure, there are the usual tropes of horror films. There is constant nagging feeling that something is going to go wrong. You expect horrifying looking people and they appear, you expect disgust and it doesn’t disappoint (why?!).  You know the character looking for something is going to turn around to find something they don’t expect or even if they expect it is going to be more horrifying than they and you expect. So, if you are a seasoned horror film person, a lot of this might disengage you. For the others amongst us, who are weaker at heart, it done well enough that we are counting the minutes to the end of the film.

That leaves the overall story and the details of how it plays out. Here the film is rather uneven. The build-up is brilliant, you know bits and pieces of the puzzle way into the second half. You are trying to piece it together when suddenly, in five minutes, the entire mystery is told. Ye, not shown, told. I guess you could thank the writers that they didn’t have one character narrate how smart they were, instead they had a character figure it out for himself. But, ultimately to you, it is told. 
Then the film is misleading. The first half wants to make you believe that it is not the supernatural story you thought it was, but more of a character falling deeper and deeper into her mental illness. And suddenly it falls right into the supernatural realm. The saving grace is that it is different from your other supernatural films. There is a little more detail. Detail that equates period blood to poison, but nevertheless detail that the sect in question believes in. 



What the film doesn’t tell you upfront though is that the makers are not going to hold back on the gore. One short moment in a morgue at the beginning of the film is enough for you to expect the worst through every moment of the film. 
So, that is what I went through for the 135 minutes. Words of a friend who is equally, if not more, averse to horror films rang through, “why would we want to pay money and set the amygdala to fire up with fear voluntarily?” I claim to do it as a part of my job. What’s your excuse?

But then, the actress has often chosen to tell stories that most wouldn’t dare to. Parambrata Chatterjee as a virtuous Bengali boy is effective in conveying how his character responds to the troubling situations he is thrown in. In his Terry Pratchett avatar, made additionally menacing with a glass eye and the droopy eyelid, Rajat Kapoor conveys his character justifiably. Ritabhari Chakraborty as the deliberately coy and listless nurse is the weakest link here. But since her character barely has much bearing to the larger story, it can be ignored if not entirely avoided.
