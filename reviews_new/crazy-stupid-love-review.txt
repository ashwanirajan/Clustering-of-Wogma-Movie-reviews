It's kind of tiring when ALL the characters in a film have a U-turnaround. Of course, there's barely anything you cannot predict about a rom-com. But there is something about the chemistry, the "lines", the situations that you look forward to. 
Parental Guidance:


Violence: A fist fight in the climax.
Language: Use of "sexual" words.
Nudity & Sexual content: Love-making scenes. And a lot of talk about getting laid.
Concept: Finding your soulmate and then keeping them.
General Look and Feel: Bright and happy.
