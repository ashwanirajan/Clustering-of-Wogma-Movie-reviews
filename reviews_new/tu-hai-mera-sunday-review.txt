
Tu Hai Mera Sunday strings together many observations from every day life. In fact, you are taking a peek into just a few weeks of the lives of five men. This is done in a breezy manner. However, every once in a while it breaks into intense drama and/or philosophy. This break in the light breeze holds the film back. 

                        A two hour version of “What is this life if full of care, we have not time to stand and stare”
                    
The film thankfully doesn't spend too much time on the history of the five lives, but we come to know these men reasonably well by the way they talk to each other and others around them. They are kept together by their weekly game of football. Their lives, individually held together by their Sunday football time.
The writing has a lightness about it that hooks you in, even if you are not completely involved with the characters. Not only does it have organic, daily life humor even the flow of the stories is smooth. Through the film, you can see the comment on lack of space in urban life – physically and mentally. This philosophy of not “standing and caring” keeps a low profile and suddenly has an outburst and you can see through the cracks.

You decipher the structure. The major religions/communities are represented through the characters. It is by design. At least two characters stay in areas that are dominantly populated by people from their community. One is a nice guy, one is a nice guy with a bad boy image, one is a nice guy but has angst filled within, one is a nice guy who wants to rebel, one is unhappily married. One has issues with his parents, one with his kids. One has trouble at work, one is comfortable in his skin. By the end, all but one of their stories are resolved nicely, without much ado. 
While this sounds formulaic and is too, to a large extent, there are charming subtleties. For instance one isn't aspirational – that's a rare trait for one of the main heroes of a story. Then, Tu Hai Mera Sunday does so well with its romantic scenes – maybe because they wouldn't necessarily qualify as romantic in the typical sense of the word. You sense the romance because the chemistry is obvious, not only to us as an audience, but to the two parties too. And we know they know and are trying to play it out so that it works out for them. These were my favourite bits in the film.



A lot of Tu Hai Mera Sunday's charm lies in the hands of its performers. And they don't let the film down. So grounded are each of the performances, that as an afterthought I wondered if the characters were written so that the actors could be just themselves. 
If it were not for the overt philosophisation and dramatisation, Tu Hai Mera Sunday would have worked much better. But, the characters are a combination of what defines them as humans and what they would like to be. Which is why the dramatisation seems bizarre. In real life, we don't really become we really want to be in one sudden stroke, right?

                        While this sounds formulaic and is too, to a large extent, there are charming subtleties.
                    
Also, such films feel like they come from a very personal space. A space that is so close to the writer/director's heart that the audience is kept at a distance, like a witness. As if they want to say, “what do you know about me or my life?” In that sense, it precludes judgment. This is not specific to Tu Hai Mera Sunday, but more about films with relatively smaller budgets, slice-of-life themes that are philosophical takes on life.

        ...The cast is rather fabulous. Barun Sobti, a wavy-haired hero-type with an easy charm, plays Arjun with a great sheepishness, especially when it's hinted that he may be a virgin. Shahana Goswami plays Kavi, the no-nonsense girl he likes (who would like a bit of nonsense after all, thank you very much), and her performance is effortless. The two are lovely together, enough to forgive the film the indulgence of escalating their relationship too fast at the end. Shiv Subramanyam is wonderful as the old man who, as he gets comfortable, regains enough coherence to start using English words, and one of the film's most tender performances comes from Rama Joshi as the harried Catholic mother torn between the children she doesn't want to see grow up. Maanvi Gagroo is quite terrific as a bouncy girl who wants everyone to be in on the fun, Rasika Duggal uses her infectious smile to great effect, while Jay Upadhyay's Jayesh Bhai and Nakul Bhalla's Mehernosh really tie the film together.

But it is this spirited woman - she is defined by her ability to smile her way through adversity - who stands out and leaves us wishing that there was more of her in this lovely little film about real people confronting real problems. But there isn't much else that the film lacks. It sets itself a modest target and achieves it without breaking a sweat. Don't wait for Sunday, watch Tu Hai Mera Sunday right away and spread the word.

Their relationship covers an entire gamut of emotions – from strangers to friends taking aimless strolls and falling in love. The last scene of the two will sell itself to those with a taste for mush.
