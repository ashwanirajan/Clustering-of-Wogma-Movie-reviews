I also found myself marveling at the fact that the project didn't get YRiF-ied. But, the thriller by itself is hardly edge-of-seat material.

So, maybe, not all thrillers need to keep you tense through the run-time. But, you need something to look forward to, especially when you have guessed whodunnit in the character's first appearance on screen. I was hoping to clap with glee to find out I was wrong and at the same time could hear myself say, “No chance!” Unfortunately, the latter part of me won. 
Fortunately, while I waited then for the inevitable reveal, there was quite a bit I could distract myself with. Maybe it is just our need for something different, but the old-world indeed has its own charm. The rusty, rugged “reality”. Sure, a lot of attention to detail. But every once in a while, you are jolted out of the era, whether it be a bold sexual attempt by a lady or music that is a tad too modern. 



The performances though keep you steadfast, willing you to see the film through to the end. Neeraj Kabi holds your interest from the beginning. And so does Swastika Mukherjee, even if it is forceful titillatio, she's there to do a job and she does it well. 
Sushant Singh Rajput, of course, fits the bill perfectly. As he gets excited by the mystery, disappointed when he doesn't “get it”, grossed out at different points in the film, you know his character, Byomkesh Bakshy just a bit more. 
This is as important as the mystery itself – knowing the investigator, your protagonist. Especially, if the writers are aspiring to turn this into a series, which they clearly are. Byomkesh Bakshy, the character does create enough interest for you to want to watch his next adventure, even if the first one by itself wasn't enticing. 
Dibaker Banerjee scored alright then, didn't he? You want to watch the next one, even though the first one leaves you underwhelmed.

        ...However, when it comes to the nuts and bits of the case, more than the whodunit aspect it is the why and how he does it aspect that teases us more. The problem is Dibakar approaches the dark fantasy like a stingy visual chemist. In his formula, Byomkesh is not allowed to romance beyond a few amorous exchanges with Satyavati (Divya Menon). It might not work for some but this is the charm of his work. He makes even a fantasy everyday like, believable. With the air already thick with the promise of a sequel, we might have got our answer to Sherlock on screen....

The film works because of incredible cinematography by Nikos Andritsakis, the beautiful art production, the anachronistic thrash metal music, and a commendable leading man. The film is intriguing, dark, slow and seductive. If only, it was as good an edge-of-the-seat whodunit. ...

So you can opt for it if really interested in watching the artistic depiction of the 40s more than anything else. And in case that doesn’t excite you at all then watch a few episodes of Basu Chatterjee-Rajit Kapoor TV series on Youtube this weekend or can even try Satyajit Ray’s CHIRIYAKHANA (with Uttam Kumar playing the lead) made on a strange case handled well by our beloved, smart detective created by Saradindu Bandopadhyay....
