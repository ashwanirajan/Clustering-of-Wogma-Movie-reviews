
You are writing a letter to life. You start, “Dear Zindagi,” (Dear life). Obviously, you are going to end up philosophizing a lot. And that's exactly what the film does too. It tries to weave that into a story of a young, confused, urban girl. But, we know it is all a metaphor and Dear Zindagi actually wants to talk to you. Ironically, this is where it loses all connect with you. 

                        Given Shah Rukh Khan is doing a lot of the pep talk, you'd think the connect is lost because of is all-knowing smirk.
                    
Given Shah Rukh Khan is doing a lot of the pep talk, you'd think the connect is lost because of is all-knowing smirk. It's not. In fact, for most parts you look at him and hear him as Jehangir Khan. And it really is great when this happens. Alia Bhatt too is her usual refreshing self, even when her character is reflecting on the big doses of philosophy being thrown her way. 
However, the confused, urban girl and her problems are only as interesting as a confused, urban girl's problems can be. Sure, I want her to sort herself out and see her life beyond her problems. But, I don't want to sit with her through her therapy sessions. This is not apathy, it is a  response to jerky screenplay and a protagonist whose problems that I understand but don't engage with.

At first glance, you could say you feel the disconnect because Kaira seems to be living a pretty decent life  - good at her work, good friends, romantic attention from the kind of guys she likes. “She has no problem”, you might want to say, “What do I root for?” Herein lies Dear Zindagi's agenda. It is ok for you to be unhappy even if most things are going your way. There is no need to be hard on yourself, it says. 
It is a noble enough cause, one that propagates  – we ought to be comfortable with ourselves even when we are unhappy. Unfortunately, to make a fictional film, it needs solid characters with an engaging story that binds them together. And to acknowledge that a poor joke is poor or a deep philosophical quote is a too deep, doesn't make either of those less tacky. 



Kaira's character is totally imaginable as a girl you'd know, the kind who uses her rudeness on her sleeve while it actually is a coping mechanism of sorts. She has her reasons to be that way, but Dear Zindagi shows them to you too late to be able to fit the complicated puzzle that Kaira makes herself out to be. 
I am glad that we know very little about Jehangir Khan. He's a therapist who seems to know what he is doing. And that is pretty much all we need to know. And the unique chemistry between Kaira and Jehangir is played out well by the two actors too. 

                        It is a noble enough cause, one that propagates  – we ought to be comfortable with ourselves even when we are unhappy.
                    
The disoriented feeling then comes from the breaks into Kaira's life, her friends, etc. It is a little too plain, a little too long, a little too repetitive. A crisper, even if not a more enticing, slice of her life would have had a better impact. Dear Zindagi is one of those very few films that start out drab and pick up steam in the second half. While it is nice to have a well-founded set-up, if it is dull it becomes even more difficult for the story to hook you. 
It is a shame then that a film that had all the right things to say; that had capable actors to say them the right way; that had characters who could have kept your thoughts from going astray doesn't do it all too well. It is a film different from the norm which by itself wins some points, but  not quite enough.

By moving ahead of romantic relationships, the movie also teaches important life lessons on how to deal with your family and how to bury the baggage of past. The flick is more like a therapy that the modern generation needs today in order to live a stress-free life. It is hard to comment whether it will work wonders in the single screen and rural areas but, if you need some freshness and a break from Bollywood clichés, then straightaway head to a theatre closest to you to grab a slice of 'Dear Zindagi'

        ...Despite the presence of Shah Rukh, there is just no emotional connect with Alia and you want to reach out and say, 'Enough!' to her. They try so hard to 'be cool'. It's not the fault of the young actors at all. Even Ali Zafar, who is perfect as the rebound boyfriend comes across as one-dimensional and easy to dismiss. The story just doesn't have enough meat. It's so Aalia-focussed, there is no room to develop the other characters. They're all there to show how 'kewl' Aalia is.
