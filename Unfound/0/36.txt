
The on-screen activity had the entire theater in splits! People around me couldn't stop laughing their guts out. So funny did they find the jokes and situations that the gags kept them happy through the unnecessary emotional scenes too. No-no, the audience was chuckling with the characters, not at them. I - well I didn't see the humor through most of the film. Somehow - hit-the-crotch, eunuchs-exist-that's-so-funny, Draupadi-like-undrape-Sari, people-falling-off-stairs, slapping-each-other, modified-cake-fights - don't even make me smile, smirk maybe, but nowhere near the grin-region. However, when I laughed at the other jokes, I laughed real hard.

I don't understand what's so weird or whacky about Prem (Ranbir Kapoor) or about his style of love. Nor do I understand what's so unusual about his story. Not a crime so far, even if you claim those things in the title. The onus of originality is not on you when the entire industry is "referencing." But get there in a way that is wholesome and entertaining. 
The sure way of doing that is with some howlarious dialogue, especially when you don't have much in terms of character arcs or story development going on. That they manage in fits and spurts. There is another way to enjoy the do, just pre-decide, you are going to enjoy, and you might too. 
The lead pair is another thing that might keep you going. Ranbir Kapoor plays the perfect Prem (Barjatya reference for the uninitiated). Charming and saccharine sweet. He has shades of Sunil, who tries to evoke Prem's darker side. Yes, he's aaawww-cho-chwweet. Diabetics might want to stay away. There's this one sequence in which he does a Jim Cary a lá The Mask
